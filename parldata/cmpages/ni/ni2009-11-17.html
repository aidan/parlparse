    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 10.30 am (Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr  Molloy] in the Chair).</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="1"></a>Assembly Business</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. On a point of order, Mr Deputy  Speaker. On reading the Official Report of yesterday&rsquo;s sitting, I noted Mr  Storey&rsquo;s remarks about Ms Caitr&iacute;ona Ruane, the Minister of Education. I noted  that he said that he was speaking as a private Member, but he described  Caitr&iacute;ona Ruane as a blatant hypocrite. He said that she was:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;one of the most blatant hypocrites in the House&rdquo;. &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official  Report, Vol 45, No 5, p252, col 2].</span></span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I would like the Hansard report to be reviewed and  a ruling to be made, because that language is totally unparliamentary.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Speaker will review the Hansard report, and I will draw his  attention to that matter.</p>
    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="2"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">British-Irish Council Summit Meeting</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:  The Speaker has received notice from the Office of the First Minister and  deputy First Minister that junior Minister Newton wishes to make a statement  regarding the British-Irish Council summit meeting.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Has the Member finished?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister) (Mr Newton)</strong>:  In compliance with the requirements of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, I wish to  make the following report on the thirteenth summit meeting of the British-Irish  Council, which was held in St Helier, Jersey, on 13 November 2009. All Northern Ireland  Ministers who attended the summit have agreed that I will make the statement to  the Assembly on their behalf and that it will be based closely on the  communiqu&eacute; from the meeting.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The States of Jersey hosted the summit in the Radisson SAS  Waterfront Hotel, St Helier, Jersey. The heads  of delegations were welcomed by the Chief Minister for Jersey,  Senator Terry Le Sueur. The Irish Government delegation was led by the  Taoiseach, Brian Cowen. The British Government delegation was led by Rt Hon  Peter Hain MP, Secretary of State for Wales. The Welsh Assembly  Government was represented by the First Minister for Wales, Rt Hon Rhodri Morgan AM. The  Scottish Government were led by the First Minister for Scotland, Rt  Hon Alex Salmond MP MSP. The Guernsey Government delegation was represented by  the Chief Minister, Deputy Lyndon Trott, and the Isle of Man Government were  represented by the Chief Minister, the honourable Tony Brown MHK. In addition  to the First Minister, the deputy First Minister and me, the Northern Ireland  delegation comprised the Minister of Education and the Minister of Culture,  Arts and Leisure. A full list of participants is attached to the statement that  was provided to Members.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It was the fifth BIC summit since the restoration of the  institutions in May 2007. The Chief Minister of Jersey,  Senator Terry Le Sueur, chaired the meeting, which focused on economic issues;  indigenous, minority and lesser-used languages issues; an update on the  strategic review of BIC; and a report on progress in the various BIC work  sectors.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The economy was discussed at the last BIC summit in Cardiff in February 2009,  and it was agreed that the forum should be used to review the current status of  the global economic downturn and its impact on each of our representative  Administrations. Ministers from each of the member Administrations discussed  the impact of the economic downturn, ongoing pressure on public expenditure,  measures to ameliorate unemployment and efforts to ensure the resumption of  bank lending to small businesses.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council explored what immediate steps could be taken to  ensure that member Administrations are well placed to take advantage of any future  global economic recovery. The Council also acknowledged the serious challenges  that are faced by all member Administrations and agreed that sharing knowledge  and information on best practice was invaluable. The Council noted the  conclusions of the independently commissioned report from Michael Foot CBE,  which stated that the Crown dependencies &mdash; Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man  &mdash; provide a significant net economic contribution to the City of London and,  ultimately, to the broader UK economy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The main focus of the discussions about indigenous,  minority and lesser-used languages was on language planning. The Council had an  extended discussion about the four key areas of adult education, family support,  young people, and local language initiatives and resource centres. The Council  noted that the availability and expansion of adult education provision for the  teaching and learning of indigenous, minority and lesser-used languages is an  important element of the process of acquisition language planning. It also  noted that adult education had an important role to play in improving and  expanding the skills base.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Member Administrations discussed and a number committed to  developing their capacity to provide bilingual public services and encouraging  other organisations to work and provide services through their respective  minority, indigenous or lesser-used languages as well as through the medium of  English. The Council considered encouraging individuals who move into  communities to learn the indigenous language and putting in place effective  adult education delivery mechanisms, both of which are essential components of  arresting the decline in usage at community level.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council considered language transmission in the family  to be a key issue in enabling indigenous, minority or lesser-used languages to  flourish. Ensuring the intergenerational transmission of a language is a  crucial element in the process of its development and maintenance. However, the  Council noted that the home, family and community were not easily accessible to  social planners and that families in indigenous or minority language situations  needed advice and guidance on how to raise their children as balanced  bilinguals.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council further noted that, for a language to flourish  and survive, it must be spoken by young people, who need to develop a sense of  ownership of the language. The Council discussed the importance of providing  young people with the relevant support and social opportunities to enable them  to use their language in all aspects of life. Ministers further discussed ways  of promoting the use of indigenous, minority and lesser-used languages among  young people. Further analysis of the economic benefits that are associated  with minority languages was proposed, and Ministers agreed to take forward that  work in the minority languages work stream.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council examined the threats surrounding communities  with a high density of indigenous, minority and lesser-used language speakers.  Halting the decline in such communities is a crucial target in various national  strategies tasked with language planning at community level. The Council  explored the benefits that can be delivered by dedicated resource centres and  local language initiatives in preserving indigenous, minority and lesser-used languages.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted and acknowledged the benefits of sharing  knowledge, ideas and best practice, and the diversity in communities&rsquo;  approaches to language planning. The Council encouraged the use of languages in  communities through projects that reflect their varying linguistic nature.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council tasked the indigenous, minority and lesser-used  languages working group to explore areas of possible co-operation with the  European Network to Promote Linguistic Diversity and other organisations to  learn from experiences elsewhere. The Council endorsed new work on themes such  as legislation, where appropriate, and on immersion, education and strategic  planning in the group&rsquo;s work programme.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council considered an update on the strategic review of  BIC, commissioned at the Belfast  summit in July 2007. The paper set out the progress that has been made on  arrangements to establish the Council&rsquo;s standing secretariat. It was agreed at  the Cardiff summit in February that the Chief  Minister of Jersey would take informal  soundings from Ministers of the Council, with a view to achieving consensus on  the standing secretariat&rsquo;s location. The Council thanked the Chief Minister of Jersey for his sterling efforts, noted that it has not  yet been possible to reach such a consensus and acknowledged the need for a  further round of consultations. However, the Council approved a legal framework  for the standing secretariat that would achieve the desired result of  strengthening BIC&rsquo;s administrative identity and support. It was noted that  co-ordinators have identified possible cost-sharing models, but final agreement  would emerge only after the standing secretariat&rsquo;s location is decided. On foot  of that agreement, exact costs will be identified.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council heard that the collaborative spatial planning  group held its inaugural meeting in Belfast in  June 2009 and a second meeting in Dublin  in October, where it considered papers on likely themes and a work programme.  The work stream brings together officials responsible for regional development  strategies, national planning strategies and frameworks in each of the  Council&rsquo;s member regions. The group is considering how member Administrations  can work together to their mutual benefit by adopting a more collaborative  approach to strategic spatial planning on cross-boundary issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The demography working group continues to be committed to  the work plan that was endorsed at a ministerial meeting in March 2008. The  main focus is on understanding migration and its impact. Northern Ireland  commissioned research into the impact of migration. The outcome of that  research was released at an event hosted in Belfast in June 2009 and included  the following reports: &lsquo;The Experiences of Migrant Workers in Northern Ireland&rsquo;;  &lsquo;The Economic, Labour Market and Skills Impacts of Migrant Workers in Northern  Ireland&rsquo;; &lsquo;The Impact of Migration on the Labour Market in Britain&rsquo;; and  &lsquo;Recent Migration into Scotland: The Evidence Base&rsquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The demography work stream will take forward work on:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;understanding the impacts of migration and the  implications of wider student flows amongst the BIC administrations.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Plans are being developed to identify appropriate  policy leads in the Administrations, with a view to discussing them at the next  British-Irish Council.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In September 2009, the digital inclusion working group held  its inaugural meeting in the Isle of Man. That proved to be a useful  opportunity for member Administrations to discover common themes and shared  understandings in the work that they are doing individually on digital  inclusion. The working group decided to focus on the following broad areas:  content outcomes; trust; engagement; and skills and training. The group&rsquo;s focus  is to deliver a report on sharing best practice on the maximisation of  engagement in a knowledge society.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In 2009, officials from the early years policy work stream  met on three occasions, and the working group remains committed to driving  forward work on early years childcare, education and health. Interventions in  those areas are key to improving children&rsquo;s life chances, particularly the  opportunities of those from disadvantaged backgrounds, and to supporting  families in challenging times.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted that the working group focused initially  on the workforce, and significant common themes in that area emerged from the  eight BIC Administrations. Those themes are the need to ensure a more child-centred  approach with better integration across services, including the better  integration of workforce planning; the need to assure the quality of provision  across the sector when children receive care and/or education; the need to  promote appropriate recognition and career progression opportunities for the  early years workforce, with suitable qualifications to accredit skills and  knowledge; and the need to address issues of diversi&shy;fication, retention and  sustainability, while recognising economic realities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In June 2009, the Scottish Government-led marine renewables  work stream held its inaugural meeting. At that meeting, member Administrations  explored their marine renewable strategies and priorities. The group agreed  that its initial focus would be on sharing updates on policy development  experiences in marine spatial planning and related legislation, the development/establishment  of test facilities and issues that relate to grid access, capacity and  investment. The group also intends to focus on raising the profile of marine renewables  as an emerging and viable renewable energy resource in the European Union.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In June 2009, the first meeting of the UK Government-led  electricity grid work stream was held. Participants gave presentations on the  challenges that electricity networks in the British Isles are facing in  accommodating significant amounts of new renewable and other generation  energies in the system so that renewable energy targets can be met and supply  security increased. Participants set out current and planned projects to meet  those challenges, including proposals to increase significantly the capacity of  the existing grid network through the use of new technology and by building new  transmission lines. The discussion established a common understanding of issues  throughout the British Isles, and the group  acknowledged that the challenges that they face are common to them all.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The environment group continues to co-operate and to  exchange information between member Administrations in areas such as  understanding extreme weather events, integrated coastal zone management,  fishing for litter and managing radioactive waste. In addition, the group  submitted a discussion paper to the second European climate change programme to  inform the development of the EU&rsquo;s Green Paper on adaption.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In April 2009, the environment group&rsquo;s ninth ministerial  meeting was held in Jersey. Ministers  reflected briefly on the creation of the energy work stream, and they received  a presentation from the Met Office Hadley Centre on extreme climate events.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In June 2009, the initial meeting of BIC housing officials  took place in Belfast.  The following issues were agreed as being pertinent across the jurisdictions:  changing demographics; greening the housing stock; affordable housing; and  investment in housing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Northern Ireland Department for Social Development is  currently drafting papers on the above topics that will examine the issues,  consider what lessons can be learnt from other areas and seek the approval of  BIC Housing Ministers to begin further work on these areas. The papers will be  circulated to all BIC Housing Ministers in advance of the ministerial meeting  which is planned for December 2009.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The indigenous, minority and lesser-used languages group  continues to focus its discussions in the following priority fields: community  development, young people, legislation, immersion education and strategic  planning. The legislation subgroup intends to hold a seminar in February 2010  which will concentrate on language rights and legislation for practitioners.  The indigenous, minority and lesser-used languages group intends to create a  subgroup to examine and discuss the European Charter for Regional or Minority  Languages in Dublin  in December 2009.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The sectoral group on the misuse of drugs has held three  senior official meetings in 2009 through the co-operation of the eight BIC  member Administrations. In March, Guernsey  representatives briefed the group on the introduction of their new legislation  to ban the product called Spice and other psychoactive substances. The aim of  this legislation is to disrupt the commercial importation and sale of such  substances, as opposed to criminalising users. The issue of legal highs and  Spice has now come to prominence at EU level. Given the ongoing developments,  the BIC sectoral group is in agreement that the issue should remain as a  standing agenda item for discussion in future meetings.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In May, Dr Suzi Lyons of the alcohol and drugs unit of the  Health Research Board in Ireland  gave a presentation to the group on the development and content of the  country&rsquo;s national drug-related deaths index, which was launched in late 2008.  The index gives Ireland  an accurate picture of the levels of drug-related deaths, thus facilitating  policy development in the drugs area. A meeting held in September focused on  prevention and on the way in which Scotland is raising the awareness  of the overall population of the dangers of drug use through its national Know  the Score campaign. The next ministerial meeting will be held in 2010, and  Ministers will discuss substance misuse in the prison setting and the responses  necessary to address that issue, along with how best to provide effective  treatment and rehabilitation options to that cohort.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The social inclusion group continues to focus on the theme  of the contribution of the third sector to promoting social inclusion under the  following main topics: responding to the effects of the economic downturn;  developing the roles of the third sector; and broadening the appeal of  volunteering and citizen involvement. Work is progressing well, with  Administrations sharing infor&shy;mation and lessons on best practice. The  officials group has now met five times and has seen in operation a wide range  of third-sector organisations. A final report, concluding the contribution of  the third sector in promoting social inclusion theme, will be the subject of discussion  at a ministerial meeting to be held in March 2010.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Work in the transport sector has continued to focus on the  mutual recognition of driving disqualifications, the mutual recognition of driving  offences that attract a penalty less than disqualification and research into  drugs and driving. The accessible transport subgroup continues in its work to  improve the information provision for disabled people who wish to travel from  one Administration area to another, through the development of a common  webpage, sharing standards of disability training schemes, scoping the current  level of concess&shy;ionary travel across Administrations and examining the  potential for their mutual recognition.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted the important work that has been taken  forward by the knowledge economy group in the area of business continuity  management of small businesses. That work stream, which Jersey  led, specifically sought to promote and develop the sustainability of business  in the face of potential serious threats, such as those arising as a result of  terrorist attacks or natural disasters. The focus of that work was on small and  medium-sized enterprises, which are believed to be most at risk. Possible  preventative measures and business continuity planning were developed to  strengthen business sustainability through a common set of best practice  guidelines.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">After consultation with the Business Continuity Institute,  the institute asked the knowledge economy group for assistance in making  recommendations for an updated copy of its &lsquo;Pocket Sized Good Practice  Guidelines&rsquo;, which has been completed. With the completion of the final copy  for the BIC website and the hard copy of &lsquo;Business Continuity Management for  Small Businesses&rsquo;, the group&rsquo;s work has concluded The Council agreed that  &lsquo;Business Continuity Management for Small Businesses&rsquo; should be published on  the BIC website and agreed that the best practice guidelines could be used in  the eight member Administrations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The next BIC summit will be held in June 2010 and will be  hosted by the Government of Guernsey. The Isle of Man  offered to host the subsequent summit.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Under &ldquo;Any other business&rdquo;, the Council considered the  relationship between the British-Irish Council and the British-Irish  Parliamentary Assembly and requested the preparation of a report for its  consideration at the next meeting in Guernsey.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Before we proceed with questions to the junior Minister, I remind  Members to switch off their mobile phones, because their operation interferes  with the recording equipment. I also remind Members that their questions must  relate to Mr Newton&rsquo;s statement.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  thank the junior Minister for coming to the House to make his statement. Does  he agree that the current period of devolution has been characterised by what  Members on this side of the House would describe as a proper focus on east-west  relationships? Previously, an unnecessary emphasis was placed on North/South  structures, but we have gone a considerable way to redressing that imbalance.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr Newton)</strong>: We have strong links with other regions in the United Kingdom.  The British-Irish Council is playing an important role in promoting and  developing those links by having positive, practical relationships and by  providing a forum for consultation and co-operation. The Council has taken  forward an extensive programme of work since it was established. In my  statement, I attempted to cover everything that happened at just one meeting.  That was the first British-Irish Council meeting that I had the privilege of  attending, and one could not fail to be impressed by the amount of work that  the various work streams are undertaking.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The British-Irish Council has met on 13 occasions since it  was established. I was nervous about the occasion of its thirteenth meeting  falling on the thirteenth day of the month, which was last Friday, but that is  a fact of life. There have been eight BIC meetings since the restoration of the  Northern Ireland Assembly in 2007, and, since 2007, there have been 10 BIC  ministerial meetings, including five summits. The first four summits were held  in Belfast, Dublin,  Cardiff and Edinburgh,  and the latest, to which my statement relates, was held in Guernsey  last Friday.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In addition to the BIC ministerial meetings, officials from  each of the BIC member Administrations meet regularly to progress work in each  of the BIC work streams and to prepare for ministerial summit meetings. There  have been 70 meetings of BIC officials since the restoration of the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are 11 live BIC work streams. Northern Ireland  leads three and is ready to lead in a fourth when the legal issues surrounding  the Baby P case are concluded. It is worthy of note that BIC dispenses with a  work stream once the task that the Council has set for it has been concluded.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When work has been completed, the report is produced and  made available as soon as possible. Therefore, there is no need to continue  that work stream. That has occurred on three occasions so far, and, in direct  response to Mr Storey&rsquo;s point, perhaps the North/South institutions could learn  something from that approach.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.00 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have addressed Mr Storey&rsquo;s point, given a full report on  the BIC summit and referred to the various work streams that are ongoing.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. T&aacute; m&eacute; bu&iacute;och den Aire as ucht a  r&aacute;itis. I thank the junior Minister for his detailed and comprehensive  statement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I note that the promotion of Irish, Welsh, Scottish Gaelic,  Ulster Scots, Manx and other languages featured prominently on the agenda &mdash; the  cl&aacute;r &mdash; of the summit in Jersey. I also note that, in promoting an enhanced language,  other Administrations have adopted a proactive and progressive approach to  legislation and strategy. One need only read the detail of today&rsquo;s statement to  appreciate that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister have any concerns about the snail&rsquo;s pace  approach of Minister McCausland and his Department in developing a strategy to  promote an enhanced language? The Minister and his Department are only at the  stage of preparing high-level principles on which such a strategy could be  based. Gregory Campbell was at the same stage two years ago when he was the  Minister.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister also detail the Minister of Culture, Arts  and Leisure&rsquo;s exact input into the BIC summit on language? He appears to be at  odds with the other Administrations.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr Newton)</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. However, I do  not agree that Minister McCausland and his Department are approaching the issue  at &ldquo;a snail&rsquo;s pace&rdquo;. We must ensure that we get the evolution absolutely right.  As Minister McCausland pointed out during the meeting, the strategy is critical  to that process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The BIC&rsquo;s minority languages group is concentrating on the  following priority areas: the use of information and communication technology  to promote languages; data research and language use surveys; legislation,  policies and strategies; and community development. I covered all those areas  in my statement to the House today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At the meeting in Cardiff on  22 September 2009, new areas of work dealing with minority languages and young  people and minority languages in primary education were discussed, and that  discussion concluded at the Jersey summit.  Moreover, the BIC&rsquo;s minority languages group plans to organise a seminar in Edinburgh in 2010 that  will concentrate on language legislation. However, that seminar will have a  wide remit and will also address policies and strategies.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My understanding is that, as outlined to the Committee for  Culture, Arts and Leisure, the Minister intends to introduce a strategy for  indigenous or regional minority languages, which aims to:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;enhance, develop and protect the Irish language and  the Ulster  Scots language, culture and heritage.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have given a comprehensive report on the BIC meeting to  the House. I hope that the Member feels that my answer to his question was  equally comprehensive.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I welcome the junior Minister&rsquo;s statement to the House. I am sure that he shares  my disappointment that agreement was not secured at the BIC summit on where the  Council&rsquo;s standing secretariat will be based. What actions has this  Administration taken to facilitate a speedier agreement on that issue?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the junior Minister also inform the House how the  Council&rsquo;s work stream on marine renewables will inform policy and practice in Northern Ireland?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr Newton)</strong>: Am I answering one question or two, Mr Deputy  Speaker?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Your choice.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr Newton)</strong>: I will take the first question first, which I suspect  was about why no decision was made on the location of the BIC secretariat.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There was considerable discussion about that matter, and  the council considered and endorsed an update paper that was presented to the Cardiff summit. The paper  contained a number of key principles and details about the establishment of the  standing secretariat. It agreed core functions, staffing profiles and  secondment arrangements and endorsed, in principle, the sharing of the costs of  the standing secretariat among all member Administrations. It tasked the  secretariat and co-ordinators to examine the start-up and running costs of the  standing secretariat, and asked that proposals on apportioning those costs be  brought to the next summit.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is now apparent that early identification of the location  of the BIC standing secretariat is a prerequisite to calculating the running  costs of that location. An early decision on location is required in order to  establish those costs and to enable each member Administration to discuss and  agree the apportioning of costs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Scotland,  Wales, the Isle of Man and Northern Ireland  offered to host the standing secretariat. The Jersey  summit host has taken soundings from each member Administration with a view to  reaching a consensus decision on the location of the standing secretariat. In  order to assist in reaching that consensus, Northern   Ireland and the Isle of Man withdrew their offers once Edinburgh became the  clear favourite.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The BIC memorandum on revised procedural guidance provides,  at paragraph 6:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;It will be open to the BIC to agree common policies  or common actions.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">In addition, paragraph 7 states:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The BIC normally will operate by consensus. In  relation to decisions on common policies or common actions, including their  means of implementation, it will operate by agreement of all members  participating in such policies or actions.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members who opt not to participate in common policies or  actions will not thereafter be involved or covered in any decision relating to  them. Efforts will, therefore, be made to reach a consensus at summit meetings.  If that is not possible, however, the decision can be deferred to the next  summit or made via correspondence between summits. Consensus was not reached on  the location of the standing secretariat, and the Chief Minister of Guernsey will undertake a further round of consultations.  The issue will be considered again at the next summit in 2010.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The council approved a legal framework for the standing  secretariat, which will achieve the desired result of strengthening the  Council&rsquo;s administrative identity and the administrative support available to  it. Establishing a permanent standing secretariat would be an important  development, and would play a crucial role in positively managing,  co-ordinating and promoting Council activities and the programme&rsquo;s overall  direction. For that reason, the Northern Ireland Executive Ministers who were  in Jersey were disappointed that a location  could not be agreed, especially when a clear favourite location emerged.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to reports that appeared in Scottish newspapers  at the weekend &mdash; and I am sure that that is where the Member picked it up from  &mdash; I agree with the Scottish First Minister&rsquo;s comment:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The UK  Government should go and reflect on the overwhelming decision of the Council.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I also note the reported comments of Scottish  officials, who pointed out:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;they had even managed to unite Ireland, with the Democratic Unionists, Sinn  Fein, and the Irish Republic all backing the Edinburgh decision.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s detailed statement and, in particular, I welcome the  work that the collaborative spatial planning group has done to date. We look forward  to any new themes and work programmes that that group may produce.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One of the most important issues discussed was the economic  downturn, which affects so many communities, and small businesses in  particular. Have the Executive identified any new options, steps or measures to  help those areas that have been badly affected in Northern Ireland, especially  small businesses?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also welcome the continued and most important work on the  misuse of drugs. We have all seen how badly that problem affects communities;  it has destroyed families and young people&rsquo;s lives. Do the Executive have any  new proposals to identify and prevent the importation and sale of substances  identified at the meeting?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr Newton)</strong>: In my statement, I referred to the ongoing work on  drugs being led by Guernsey and, if I may, I  will leave that part of the drugs issue with the Member. However, I am happy to  follow that up in writing if the Member wishes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The first part of Mr Ramsey&rsquo;s question centred on the  recession and the economic downturn. Obviously, that is of concern and it took  up a fair bit of the discussion in Jersey. We  all know that the credit crunch has adversely affected the local economy. Over  the past year, employ&shy;ment has fallen, along with output in the construction industry,  and manufacturing and the services sector have contracted. However, with regard  to the unemployment situation, although I do not want to say that to some  extent we are pleased, as that would be the wrong word, we have not fared as  badly as other parts; for example, the Republic or other parts of the UK.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The public sector, which was put forward as a weakness in  our economy, has become a strength. To some extent, that has saved us in a way  that other Administrations have not been saved. Obviously, it is of concern  that the number of unemployment benefit claimants has increased by more than  70% over the year, which compares with an increase of 62% over the year for the  UK  as a whole. The total number of people in employment has increased slightly  over the quarter &mdash; by 60,000 &mdash; and decreased by 34,000 over the year. However, Northern Ireland has an impressive record for  creating employment over the past decade, with London the only region experiencing more  rapid employment growth. Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  economic inactivity rate is 28&middot;7%, which is the highest of all the UK regions. Ten  years ago, Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  economic activity rate was lower than the current rate of 27&middot;7%.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Output in the service sector remained relatively constant  over the quarter, and fell by 2% over 2009. By comparison, output in the UK service  sector fell by 0&middot;6% over the quarter and by 4&middot;2% over the year. Nevertheless,  the forecasts for the UK economy at best predict unemployment to continue to  rise until the middle of 2010, and some forecasts predict an even worse  outcome, with the peak of unemployment coming in 2011. The First Trust forecast  for the local economy predicts that unemployment will continue to rise and  employment will fall until the middle of 2010, when some stability may return.  We may be dealing with the impacts and the costs of unemployment for some  months to come.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In sharing information during the summit, we saw a great  determination in all Administrations to share best practice. Indeed, in sharing  best practice, we should try to protect each other, as it is in the interests  of all the Administrations to support each other.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A downturn in Northern   Ireland will have an impact on the Scottish economy, and  a downturn in the Republic of Ireland will have an impact on England. There  is obviously a great desire among all the nations to share initiatives and best  practice and to support each other in order that the entire community,  including business, can survive the downturn as best as possible.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  thank the junior Minister for his comprehensive statement. I also note that  considerable time has been given to the discussion of indigenous, minority and  lesser-used languages. For a long time in Northern Ireland, the focus on  minority languages has only been on Irish and Ulster Scots, to the great  disappointment of all ethnic minority communities here. As far as I am aware,  there is no public funding available to any of those communities to run classes  to teach young people their birth language, whether that be Chinese, Arabic,  Hindi, Urdu, or any other minority language.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Given the opportunities at the Council to hear of the good  practices in other jurisdictions and regions, will the Executive consider  putting more effort into promoting community languages in Northern Ireland?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr Newton)</strong>: I thank the Member for her question. At the meeting,  we were dealing with indigenous, minority and lesser-used languages. The Member  has made a valuable point, and I am happy to ensure that it is raised. If the  Member is content, I am willing to ensure that any information that becomes  available to me on that issue is fed back to her.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bresland</strong>:  I thank the junior Minister for his statement. I note that, yet again, no  Ulster Unionist Minister attended the British-Irish Council summit. Will the  junior Minister inform the House why some of his ministerial colleagues do not  take their responsibilities to the east-west relationship seriously? <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr Newton)</strong>: I am being barracked from the other side of the  Chamber.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Member for his question. He is right, in a  sense. In addition to the First Minister and the deputy First Minister &mdash; as I  suspect he has picked up from the report &mdash; Minister Ruane, Minister McCausland  and I attended on behalf of the Northern Ireland Executive. I cannot explain  why other Ministers made the decision not to attend.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is obviously an important opportunity to share best  practice, gain knowledge and strengthen the British Isles  axis. All those are important initiatives. I was happy to stand in for Sir Reg  Empey and deal with the demographic issues that arose on his behalf. I  recollect that the last time I stood in for a Minister in the Chamber I got  myself into some trouble for doing so.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I cannot answer for other Ministers. I found it a valuable  exercise, as did the other Ministers who were there. Indeed, the British  Government Ministers, the Taoiseach, and Rhodri Morgan, the First Minister of  Wales, found it an appropriate venue to be at. Others need to make up their  minds about whether they regard it as a priority, and, if so, to be in  attendance.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. If BIC is more robust than it has  been before, and if, as Mervyn Storey suggested and the junior Minister  somewhat confirmed, it now has teeth, the reports that emanate from it are not  as easy to dismiss and their implementation will be more robust. In that  context, and given the discussion on indigenous, minority and lesser-used  languages and the progressive approach that is taken in Scotland and Wales, will the junior Minister  outline the key areas where he believes the North can do more to promote the  Irish language and Ulster Scots?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr Newton)</strong>: I made my statement on behalf of the First Minister  on the work that took place in Jersey. At that  meeting, the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure spoke about the fact that he  intends to introduce a strategy for indigenous or regional minority languages,  with the aim of protecting, enhancing, and developing the Irish language and  Ulster-Scots heritage and culture. I think that the Minister has already been  to the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure to outline that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It was good to learn from the language strategies that are  being adopted in Scotland  and Wales and to hear of the  resurgence of interest in the indigenous language in Jersey.  However, there is not going to be a one-size-fits-all approach. If we can learn  from Scotland and Wales, that is  excellent, but I am sure that the Minister feels that he needs to develop his  own strategy and share that with the Committee and the House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  As the junior Minister is aware, Members of the Assembly attend the  British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly (BIPA). Did the recent summit meeting  consider the possibility of more structured relationships between BIC and BIPA?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr Newton)</strong>: That was considered, and I covered that question to  some extent in my reply to Mr McCallister.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The issue was brought up under &ldquo;any other business&rdquo; at the  meeting. In 2002, the British-Irish Council wrote to the British-Irish  Inter-Parliamentary Body, which has been renamed the British-Irish  Parliamentary Assembly, to routinely exchange public documents, including  communiqu&eacute;s that are issued following summits and ministerial meetings. In  return, BIIPB was asked to provide copies of its relevant reports to BIC. In  late 2003, the BIIPB secretariat raised the issue of sending delegates as observers  to BIC meetings, and, following consultation with the BIC member  Administrations, the BIC secretariat responded that BIC:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;acts as a forum in which the executive branch of  government in the respective member administrations can meet to discuss, in  confidence, matters of mutual interest within the competence of the relevant  administrations. It is the agreed view of the BIC members that it would not  therefore be appropriate for members of the BIIPB, representing the  legislatures of individual BIC members to attend its meetings.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, on 13 July 2009, the Secretary of State for Wales,  the Rt Hon Peter Hain, who is well known to the Member, wrote to each BIC  member Administration, proposing that the relationship between BIPA and BIC should  be deepened through the following actions: future meetings of the BIPA to be  addressed by relevant Ministers from BIC, depending on the theme of the  previous summit; reports from BIPA committees to be sent to the BIC; the BIPA  co-chairpersons to have observer status at BIC summits; and suitable arrange&shy;ments  to be made for BIC members to observe BIPA&rsquo;s meetings.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On 27 August 2009, a response stated that each BIC Administration  will have a view on the issues that were raised and that any change to the  current relationship between the Council and BIPA will, as is proper, be subject  to a collective decision, taken through the normal process, involving the  secretariat and all member Administrations. Mr Hain wrote to each member  Administration to inform them of his intention to discuss those issues under  &ldquo;any other business&rdquo; at the summit in Jersey,  and he did so.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A report will be prepared on the relationship between the  British-Irish Council and the British-Irish Parliamentary Association for  consideration at the next summit in Guernsey.  I do not want to pre-empt the outcome of those deliberations; that would be  premature. I can see advantages in a properly defined relationship that  recognises the different roles of the two bodies. I believe that Members would  also wish to emphasise those differing roles.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  I thank the junior Minister for his statement, which described many excellent  initiatives. Mindful of current financial constraints, does the Council, when  it discusses best practice, costs and needs, examine how all or any of those  initiatives will be funded when they come before the Administrations?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr Newton)</strong>: When I responded to Mr McCallister&rsquo;s question about  the establishment of the secretariat, I emphasised the fact that a budget and  costs would need to be established and that costings would need to be taken  into account when determining where the secretariat would function.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that, in all aspects of its work, BIC has the  correct ethos. No one wants to operate a project for its own sake: it must  offer value for money. Although it is never possible to guarantee the outcome  of any work that is undertaken, particularly in these days of economic  constraint, value for money will be the driving factor. The benefits of each  piece of research that is done flow into our economy and into that of the  greater, collective Administrations&rsquo; economy.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his detailed and comprehensive statement, which shows  the value of the British-Irish Council. There is no need for Members to pit BIC  against the North/South Ministerial Council. The two bodies are not in  competition; they work together. They dovetail in the political architecture of  the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">BIC is doing valuable work on drug misuse. Can the Minister  report to the House what he hopes will arise from the concentrated efforts of  all member jurisdictions to deal with drug misuse? How can that work be applied  in Northern Ireland?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr Newton)</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. Obviously, that  issue is of growing importance throughout the British   Isles and further afield. It can only be welcome when work that is  done in one jurisdiction is shared with others. That is another expression of  the sharing of best practice. The important ongoing work on drug misuse offers  the opportunity to discuss and debate issues in that area, which are of obvious  mutual concern.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In June 2008, Northern Ireland hosted a most informative  and positive seminar on the use of advances in prevention science to guide  substance misuse prevention in communities. Discussions at official level about  legal highs have been particularly useful.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Tackling the misuse of drugs is a challenge for all member  Administrations of the Council, and the Republic of Ireland  takes responsibility for advancing co-operation on that issue. Perhaps that is  the political point that the Member was trying to make, while being nice about  it of course. The Republic   of Ireland leads the  misuse of drugs sectoral group, and through the co-operation of the eight BIC  member Administrations, it successfully carried out its work programme in 2008  and 2009.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During the tenth BIC summit meeting, which took place in  Dublin in February 2008, it was agreed to include a renewed focus on the  families of problem drug users in any future drugs strategy, with a view to  providing increased support to those families and to better harness their  potential to facilitate life improvements for problem drug users.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with the Member about the usefulness of the BIC  meetings and the whole ethos that results from them.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an r&aacute;iteas &oacute;n  Aire.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the junior Minister&rsquo;s statement, in which he  referred to the electricity grid work stream and the building of new  transmission lines. Will he say whether the proposed 400-kilovolt overhead  interconnector that is to run from Moy in Tyrone to Cavan then on to Meath was  discussed? If it was not discussed, will he give an assurance that the issue  will be on the agenda for the next meeting? There are serious concerns about  that overhead interconnector in my own constituency.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr Newton)</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. Northern Ireland is working with the Republic of Ireland to develop thinking on grid  infrastructure that can bring mutual benefits to the region. The Member is  obviously aware that there have been a number of meetings between the energy  Ministers at the BIC energy summit, and there will be more during the spring of  2010.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not think that the subject that the Member raised was  specifically mentioned at the latest meeting, but I assure him that I will  follow that issue up on his behalf, and I will get a written response to him.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as a  r&aacute;iteas. Tugaim faoi deara &oacute;na r&aacute;iteas go bhfuil fo-ghr&uacute;pa le bun&uacute; i m&iacute; na  Nollag leis an Chairt Eorpach ar Theangacha R&eacute;igi&uacute;nacha agus Mionlaigh a  ini&uacute;chadh agus a phl&eacute;. Arbh fh&eacute;idir leis an Aire a dhearbh&uacute; go bhfoilseoidh a  Roinn an tuairisc th&aacute;naisteach ar an tr&iacute;&uacute; tuairisc thr&eacute;imhseach de choiste na  saineolaithe ar chur i bhfeidhm na cairte i dTuaisceart na h&Eacute;ireann? Arbh  fh&eacute;idir leis a r&aacute; fosta cad ina thaobh nach raibh cur isteach sa tuairisc &oacute;na Roinn  ag an am chu&iacute;?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the junior Minister for his statement. I notice  that a subgroup is to be established to examine and discuss the European  Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, and that it will meet in Dublin in December. Will  the junior Minister assure the House that, before that group meets, OFMDFM will  publish the Northern Ireland  supplementary report to the third periodic report of the committee of experts  that oversees the implementation of the charter in Northern Ireland?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the junior Minister explain why the Northern Ireland  contribution to that committee of experts was not made at the appropriate time  and what actions his Department intends to take to comply with the charter? Go  raibh maith agat.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr Newton)</strong>: It is not possible for me to guarantee anything that  comes out of the total work of OFMDFM. However, I will certainly raise the  Member&rsquo;s concerns and endeavour to get him a response before that subgroup  meets.</p>
    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="3"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading">North/South Ministerial Council</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Institutional Format</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I have received notice from the Office of the First Minister and  deputy First Minister that the deputy First Minister wishes to make a statement  on the North/South Ministerial Council meeting in institutional format.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister (Mr M McGuinness)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. In  compliance with section 52C(2) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, we wish to  make the following statement on the fifth meeting of the North/South  Ministerial Council (NSMC) in institutional format, which was held in Stormont  Castle on Wednesday 11 November 2009.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive Ministers who attended the meeting have  approved the report, and we make it on their behalf. The Executive delegation  was led by the First Minister, Peter Robinson MP MLA, and me, and we also  chaired the meeting. In addition, the following Executive Ministers were in  attendance: Margaret Ritchie, Minister for Social Development, and junior Minister  Robin Newton. The Irish Government delegation was led by Miche&aacute;l Martin TD,  Minister for Foreign Affairs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During the meeting, we had a broad discussion with Minister  Martin on practical, mutually beneficial co-operation in the context of the  current economic and budgetary challenges facing each jurisdiction.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On obstacles to cross-border mobility, the Council noted  and welcomed the continuing popularity of the Border People website &mdash;  www.borderpeople.info &mdash; and the latest marketing strategy for the website that  is targeting specific events in the border region.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted that a plan is in place to inform  teachers about recent changes in pension arrangements for those who wish to  transfer to work in the other jurisdiction. As a first step, an information  seminar will be held with the main teachers&rsquo; trade unions and the information  provided will be circulated to other Departments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council also noted that the NSMC joint secretariat has  facilitated a meeting between relevant Departments to discuss access to welfare  benefits for cross-border workers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council considered a paper on EU matters that were  raised in the NSMC and noted the work on EU-related matters in the relevant  NSMC sectoral formats since April 2009. That included developments in the  agriculture, aquaculture and marine, and special EU programmes sectors.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers considered a paper on North/South bodies issues  and discussed a range of issues relating to the North/South implementation  bodies and Tourism Ireland Limited, including the implementation of cumulative  efficiency savings in their 2009 and 2010 budgets, and they agreed other  cost-saving measures. The Council approved the 2009 business plan for the  Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB). It also agreed a process to bring up to  date specific non-pay terms and conditions for the bodies&rsquo; staff.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council considered a paper on the NSMC joint  secretariat&rsquo;s new accommodation and noted that construction work on the new  permanent accommodation for the NSMC joint secretariat in Armagh  is proceeding on target and that plans are being made for an official opening  in 2010. The Council also agreed that, where practicable, future NSMC meetings  will be held in the new accommodation, representing a more cost effective and  efficient use of resources.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted that progress in all of the matters that  were discussed at the institutional meeting will be reported to the next NSMC  plenary meeting, and it agreed to meet again in institutional format as  appropriate.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I again remind Members to ask questions on the statement and not  to read out their own statements.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I thank the deputy First Minister for that statement. Some issues to do with  agriculture have not been expanded on. Was there any discussion about last year&rsquo;s  dioxin problem, and, if so, was there any indication of how compensation could  be reached for the farmers in Northern    Ireland who were affected by that?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The short answer is no; there was no discussion on that matter.  However, I will endeavour to get the Member an up to date assessment of where  the situation sits, and I will write to him about that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. He referred to a broad discussion having  taken place with Minister Martin on practical, mutually beneficial co-operation  in the context of the current economic and budgetary challenges facing each  jurisdiction, and I welcome that. Will the Minister tell me what the tone and  nature of that discussion was and whether it was a positive discussion? Were he  and the First Minister of one mind in approaching those issues so that we can  get mutually beneficial co-operation across the island?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: It was a very wide-ranging discussion. North and South, we are  dealing with serious economic difficulties and pressures, and we are all very  conscious of the need to work in a spirit of co-operation, where it is mutually  beneficial. Miche&aacute;l Martin, the First Minister and I had a very useful  discussion. It was obvious from the contributions that all three of us are  equally determined, where there are mutually beneficial outcomes, to endeavour  to continue to engage in a way that will allow us to position ourselves to come  out of this time of grave economic difficulties in a way that enhances the  spirit of co-operation. That spirit is clearly there, as demonstrated through  the establishment of the North/South Ministerial Council.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Since InterTradeIreland came into being, we have seen a  massive increase in co-operation, North and South, and the success of that body  sends a very powerful message to all of us. We need to work in a spirit of  co-operation to derive as much benefit as possible for all the people of this  island.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>: I  thank the deputy First Minister for his statement. Tourism Ireland was  considered as part of the discussions. I am delighted that Carrickfergus Castle  featured very prominently in a recent national advertise&shy;ment from Tourism Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member must ask a question.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>:  Will the Minister give more details on the cost-saving measures that were  discussed at the meeting?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: We are all very conscious of the tremendous work that Tourism  Ireland does. The North/South implementation bodies and Tourism Ireland are funded  jointly by the Executive and the Irish Government. Budgets for those bodies are  determined annually, based on agreed business plans which are approved by  sponsor and finance Departments, Ministers in both jurisdictions, and by the  NSMC.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Expenditure is monitored throughout the year, and each  body, including Tourism Ireland,  submits an annual statement of accounts to the Comptroller and Auditor General  for the North and to the Irish Comptroller and Auditor General, who, in  co-operation, examine and certify the accounts. Copies of audited accounts are  laid in the Assembly and the Oireachtas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are all very conscious that this is a time of grave  economic pressure; particularly, in the South. Anybody who has seen or heard  the news recently will know of the Irish Government&rsquo;s very clear intention to  bring in, what many people are describing as, fairly swingeing cuts to all  sorts of budgets all over the place. None of us is under the illusion that we  are going to remain unaffected by the approach adopted by the Irish Government.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is critically important that we are in a position to  ensure that the bodies continue to deliver what they were established to  deliver. The big challenge is whether those bodies can do that against a  backdrop of the quite clear signals that are coming from the institutions in  the South, which we will find ourselves bound to by dint of the fact that much  of the work of the North/South Ministerial Council on implementation bodies is  done on a 50:50 basis.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Will the joint First Minister  detail discussions on the plans that are in place to inform teachers about  recent changes in pension arrangements for those in the profession who wish to  work in the North and the South?</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: I made it clear in my statement that a considerable amount of  work has been done on that matter. Much more information on the issue is now  widely available, and that is of great benefit to those teachers in each  jurisdiction who, on occasion, wish to change schools and work in a different jurisdiction.  The trade unions are involved in the information seminars that are taking  place, and those will be of tremendous benefit to teachers.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  On the issue of cross-border mobility, was there any mention of the INTERREG  programme? I ask that with the east border region in mind. I have heard many  complaints about issues being stalled for the past three or four years and that  projects that should have been enacted are not moving forward. From what the  deputy First Minister heard at the North/South Ministerial Council meeting, is  he able to throw any light on that?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: As we go forward, INTERREG is of tremendous importance to all of  us. The INTERREG IVa programme provides in the region of &euro;256 million to  encourage economic development. That is the only EU programme operating in the  North that has increased its budget &mdash; a 40% increase on the budget for the  INTERREG IIIa programme. To date, the programme has approved 34 projects worth  &euro;152&middot;5 million. Approved projects include Project Kelvin, which is an ICT  infrastructure initiative that has received &euro;30 million.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The inclusion of areas of western Scotland in the  eligible area has brought an important new dimension. Policy and planning  expectation remains that the five local-authority based partnerships will play  a significant role in the new programme as lead partners in strategic projects.  INTERREG IVa remains primarily a North/South cross-border programme. All  projects that involve Scotland  must also involve the North and the South. Scottish eligibility derives from Scotland&rsquo;s  maritime border with the South. Projects that purely involve the North of  Ireland and Scotland  are ineligible, because they do not involve an international border.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The SEUPB is confident that INTERREG IVa will meet its 2009  N+2 target of &euro;14 million. The Member mentioned the slowness of the programme&rsquo;s  projects. I acknowledge that there have been delays, but I have been assured  that things are moving forward with speed.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for the  update on the new buildings in Armagh city. I  ask the joint First Minister whether the NSMC has &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Speaker has ruled that Ministers should be addressed by their  proper title. In this case, the title &ldquo;deputy First Minister&rdquo; should be used.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>: I  ask the Minister whether the NSMC has carried out a review of remuneration for  board members? Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: A review has been carried out, and a 10% cut for board members  was approved at the meeting.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Will the Minister detail the work  that has been done to increase the take-up of transnational and INTERREG  inter-regional European programmes? At a future meeting of the North/South  Ministerial Council, will he raise the issue of obstacles to cross-border  mobility, specifically in respect of school-transport entitlement?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: Following the report of the European Commission task force, the  Executive agreed to increase the North&rsquo;s transitional and inter-regional  participation. In 2009, we have already surpassed the number of successful  projects that were achieved under those programmes in the entire 2000-06  programme period. There are 22 successful projects with partners here, and they  will receive EU funding totalling approx&shy;imately &euro;4&middot;5 million.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Our partners in those programmes are working with partners  from 12 EU member states and other European countries. In the face of the  likely decline in assistance from the EU structural funds in the future and in  the current economic climate, it is important to build capacity so that the  additional funding that is available under the programmes can be competed for.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member asked about transport in border regions. As a  former Minister of Education, I know that that is a difficult area to deal  with. I have no doubt that the Minister of Education in the North and the  Minister for Education and Science in the South will continue to monitor that  situation.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I thank the deputy First Minister for his statement. It mentions:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;developments in the agriculture, aquaculture and  marine, and special EU programmes sectors.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Unfortunately, the statement does not contain many  details about that. I know that that is not the deputy First Minister&rsquo;s fault.  However, as elected representatives and Assembly Members, we need more details  about those issues so that we can, in turn, pass information about them to our  constituents.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The statement mentioned &ldquo;efficiency savings&rdquo; and cost  cutting in Tourism Ireland.  Will the deputy First Minister confirm that, despite those measures, Tourism Ireland can still  deliver tourism and attract tourists to our shores?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: As I said earlier, we are all conscious, North and South, that we  face huge economic pressures and difficulties. We will hear the outcome of the  Budget announcement that will, no doubt, come from Dublin in the next few weeks. That will  outline the steps that they are prepared to take to try to pull the economic  circumstances around to a satisfactory level.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">No one is under any illusion whatever that we will remain  unaffected by the approach that will be taken. The big challenge for the bodies  that were established, particularly Tourism Ireland, which Mr Shannon  mentioned, is to be in a position to deliver what they can in accordance with  the challenges and proposals that have been set by the NSMC. As we go forward,  we are conscious that those bodies will not remain unaffected by cuts. However,  the big trick is to ensure that the bodies still deliver what they intended to  deliver in the first place. In other words, they must cut the cloth to meet the  challenges that they face. I have no doubt that all the bodies will be  determined to ensure that services to citizens will continue to be delivered at  the high level that they have been since the bodies were established.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Shannon asked about agriculture. Farmers have great  concern about the future of EU dairy farming. We have heard the debates on low  milk prices over the past year. That situation has been of grave concern to  many farmers and has placed many farms in a loss-making situation. Thankfully,  world markets have improved as recent milk auction prices have shown a  substantial increase. That should be reflected in producers&rsquo; milk prices in the  next few months.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Developments in the past year have shown that the  difficulties that are caused by the volatility in world markets have created  huge problems for farmers. We need to consider how to reduce that volatility  and enable farmers to better cope with market fluctuations in future. Under EU  legislation, milk quotas will end in 2015. The EU Commissioner has stated  firmly that the Commission will not propose an extension to the milk-quota  regime. Given that, it is important for the industry to be able to make a  smooth adjustment to a quota-free environment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The proposed EU fund of &euro;280 million for the dairy sector  is welcome. However, that still requires the approval of EU Finance Ministers,  who will meet on 19 November. If the British Government do not support the measure  and refuse to provide additional funds for it, they could disadvantage our  dairy farmers in comparison with those in other EU countries. As Members know,  the debate about agriculture in Europe is  ongoing, and we seem to return to discussions on the matter almost every year.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  The deputy First Minister has touched on part of my question already, but will  he outline what discussions took place on the types of practical and mutually  beneficial co-operation that could address the severe budgetary challenges  facing the Republic of Ireland and this part of the UK?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: During the meeting, we had a broad discussion with Minister  Martin on practical and mutually beneficial co-operation in the context of the  current economic and budgetary challenges facing each jurisdiction. Minister  Martin outlined the challenges facing the Irish Government and the steps that  they propose to take to meet those challenges. He said, for example, that the  NAMA legislation is progressing, and he referred to the constructive  discussions that have taken place between the two Finance Ministers, Minister  Wilson and Minister Lenihan. We all recognise that it is still too early to  talk about green shoots. We are all ultra-cautious about recovery, even though  everyone around us is saying that we are beginning to emerge from the  recession.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We outlined the work of the cross-sector advisory forum and  of the various subgroups that are under consideration. We also discussed the  importance of house building, from an economic point of view and on the basis  of need. We agreed that it will be important in future to look for innovative  ways in which to finance housing. With the forecast pace of public expenditure  slowing, we will have difficult choices to make in the near future as we  determine our priorities for budgets that are already very tight.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At the meeting, Minister Martin outlined some fairly  serious proposals from his Government to produce savings in public expenditure,  and no doubt we will hear about those proposals shortly. We agreed that it is  important that our public spending be as efficient and effective as possible,  and, in that context, we agreed that it would be useful for our officials to  explore with Irish Government officials opportunities for efficiency savings  through co-operation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There has been a big debate about the NAMA legislation. The  Minister of Finance and Personnel had a very constructive meeting with his  counterpart, Minister Lenihan, on 8 September 2009 to discuss NAMA&rsquo;s possible  impact in this jurisdiction. The size of the portfolio of loans residing here is  critical to the impact on our local economy. At that meeting, Minister Lenihan indicated  that some &euro;4&middot;8 billion in loans here are to be transferred from participating  banks to NAMA. I hasten to add that that is a much lower figure than the  earlier estimates of approximately &euro;20 billion. However, even &euro;4&middot;8 billion in  exposed local assets has considerable implications for our economy. That figure  is the equivalent of approximately 15% of the entire economy&rsquo;s output. Our key  concern is that there should be no fire sale of those assets, because that  would have a deflationary effect on the local property market and the wider  economy. Minister Lenihan confirmed that it was in no one&rsquo;s interests to see  such a sale happen. We took considerable comfort from that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I thank the deputy First Minister for his statement. Along with the Assembly,  the British-Irish Council and the North/South Ministerial Council form a major  part of the institutions established under the Good Friday Agreement and have  played a significant role in bringing about reconciliation in Ireland. I  welcome the fact that the North/South Ministerial Council and its secretariat  will have a new home in the primatial city of Armagh &mdash; no better place for it. Will the  deputy First Minister give an indicative date for the opening of the new  headquarters of the North/South Ministerial Council&rsquo;s secretariat?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: I said in my statement that we expect the new building to be  ready for occupation early next year. We received a progress report, and I am told  that the builders are up to the roof and that progress has been astonishing. We  recognise the symbolism of the establishment of the North/South Ministerial  Council alongside the power-sharing arrangements. I also compliment the work  done by the British-Irish Council, which we attended in Jersey  last week.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">All those institutions are very important. We all recognise  that it is critical that we work together, particularly in the context of  current economic circum<sup>_</sup>stances. Mutual benefit is derived through  recognising the need for businesspeople, North and South, to work  collaboratively to build their businesses. The work of InterTradeIreland has  also been a huge success, as has the work of Tourism Ireland, although it has been affected  by the strength of sterling and associated pressures.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.00 noon</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those institutions are clearly invaluable. They have a very  powerful role to play in the restoration of our economy, as well as in the  context of national recon&shy;ciliation. It is vital that people, North and South,  meet on an ongoing and consistent basis. It is equally important for those  people to see that their politicians, North and South, have the ability to come  together and make decisions in their interest.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have agreed that, where practicable, future NSMC  meetings will be held in the new accommodation in Armagh.  That will represent a more cost-effective and efficient use of resources. Armagh City  and District Council will be responsible for all construction costs, and it  will lease the building to the NSMC joint secretariat. Maintenance, running  costs and the tenant&rsquo;s fit-out will be the tenant&rsquo;s responsibility. The  tenant&rsquo;s fit-out costs, including furniture, fittings, glazing, doors, wall,  floor and ceiling finishes, and professional fees were originally estimated at  around &pound;1&middot;5 million. However, that estimate has recently been downscaled to  &pound;1&middot;1 million following discussions and negotiations with the developer.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those costs will be shared on a 50:50 basis with the Government  in Dublin. A  single lump-sum payment will be required, probably in March 2010. Our  contribution will be &pound;550,000. The total cost of the lease as well as the  running costs will be shared on a 50:50 basis with the Irish Government. The estimated  cost of the lease to OFMDFM will be &pound;115,000, subject to final contract. That  is an increase of &pound;85,000 on the current lease.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The design reflects the highest environmental and energy-saving  standards and will complement the existing architecture of Armagh  city. It will enhance the positive image and standing of Armagh as an important  centre for public administration and cross-border activity, and it will act as  an important catalyst in the regeneration of a disadvantaged area of Armagh city.</p>
    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="4"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">North/South Ministerial Council:</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Transport Sectoral Format</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I have been informed that the Speaker has received notice from the  Minister for Regional Development that he wishes to make a statement on the  North/South Ministerial Council meeting in transport sectoral format.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development (Mr Murphy)</strong>: A LeasCheann Comhairle, in compliance  with section 52 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, I wish to make the following  statement on the seventh North/South Ministerial Council meeting in transport sectoral  format, which was held in Dublin  on Wednesday 4 November 2009. The Minister of the Environment, Edwin Poots, has  approved the report, and I make the statement on his behalf.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive were represented by the Minister of the  Environment and me. The Irish Government were represented by Noel Dempsey TD,  Minister for Transport, who chaired the meeting. The Council noted progress made  since the last meeting in April 2009 and welcomed the chance to meet to discuss  opportunities for cross-border co-operation on strategic transport planning and  road safety.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers discussed progress on the Dublin  to Belfast rail  link. They noted the updated position on the Malahide bridge collapse and  agreed that both rail companies will continue to work to recover passenger  numbers after the relaunch of the service. They also agreed that the financial  implications of the proposals to improve the reliability of trains on that line  should be reviewed with a view to putting a reconfigured fleet in place as soon  as possible.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers noted that the new train station at Newry has  been fully operational since 7 September 2009. They also discussed the position  on the development of integrated ticketing systems and the long-term aspiration  to develop integrated ticketing for North/South services.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted that both the A5 north-west gateway from  Derry to Aughnacloy and the A8 Belfast to Larne road projects had achieved the  second significant milestone &mdash; the preparation of a preferred options report &mdash; on  target and that work is progressing to meet the third significant milestone &mdash;  the publication of the draft Orders &mdash; by late 2010 or early 2011.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers noted that the contractors and designers for both  projects are expected to be appointed by late autumn 2009. The Minister for  Transport will make a payment of &euro;9 million to the NI Consolidated Fund before  the end of 2009 in accordance with agreed procedures. Ministers also noted the  signing of PPP contracts for two service stations on the M1, which are due to  open in late 2010.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The current position on road deaths in each jurisdiction was  discussed, and Ministers noted the declaration that was recently made to the EU  in relation to bilateral application of the convention on the mutual  recognition of driving disqualifications. Once the mutual recognition of  driving disqualifications is in place, a project plan will be developed to  pursue the mutual recognition of penalty points. That will be a complex and  longer-term process, because, currently, the penalty point systems are  different in each jurisdiction.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers reviewed progress on the existing road safety  strategies and on the new strategy for the North, which will be taken forward  by DOE. They also reviewed the continuing co-operation between the two  jurisdictions in the areas of advertising and publicity, research and  enforcement. Ministers noted the background to and current position on the new  lower drink-driving limits in both jurisdictions and agreed that exploration of  the potential for a co-ordinated approach to the introduction of new limits  should continue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers noted the Department of Transport&rsquo;s publication  of the &lsquo;National Cycle Policy Framework&rsquo; as a follow-up to the Smarter Travel  policy and that the Department for Regional Development actively promotes walking,  cycling, public transport and car sharing to businesses, commuters and schools  through its Travelwise initiative. They also noted that the Department for  Regional Development has initiated a review of the regional transportation  strategy to ensure more sustainable transport arrangements and that it has  produced a report that sets out the greenhouse gas emissions from transport.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted that officials are engaging positively in  the sustainable transport agenda and progressing initiatives that underline the  all-island dimension. It looks forward to an update at a future NSMC meeting in  transport sectoral format. Ministers noted that the jointly supported  car-sharing website for the north-west region is now operational and is  expected to be launched formally before Christmas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers noted that, as a first step in organising a freight  forum, relevant Departments will jointly organise a meeting of key stakeholders  in the freight sector in early December 2009 to identify priority issues to be  considered by the forum. Those priority issues will subsequently be considered  in depth by working groups comprising representatives of the key stakeholders  and persons with an interest in promoting the sustainable freight sector  throughout the island. Ministers requested that a report on progress be made at  the future meeting of the North/South Ministerial Council.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted that a contractor has been appointed to  undertake the replacement of bridges on the Tyrone/Monaghan border with a  completion date in winter 2010. Ministers also noted that Louth County Council continues  to undertake a further appraisal of the proposed Narrow Water bridge project.  Further reports on those projects will be presented at a future NSMC meeting in  transport sectoral format.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers noted that work continues on the cross-border,  community-based rural transport pilot in line with the agreed project plan. The  Departments are satisfied that the outcomes will be relevant to consideration  of issues of cross-border transport and social inclusion, and they look forward  to a full report being presented to a future NSMC meeting in transport sectoral  format. The Council agreed to meet in that format again in March 2010.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cobain</strong>:  What progress have the Department and Roads Service made in considering the  feasibility study for a southern relief road, which has been with the  Department since February? When does the Minister anticipate that his  Department will make a decision on that issue?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I assume that the Member refers to the southern  relief road in Newry. We announced that the first study on that road showed  that the construction of such a project was economically viable and presented a  number of options. I am not sure whether the Member is terribly familiar with  the area, but it is environmentally sensitive because it crosses an area that  leads down to Carlingford Lough. Therefore, there are significant environmental  issues on the waterway and on Flagstaff ridge,  which is on the Armagh side of the Newry to  Warrenpoint road. There are many significant issues concerning the landscape  that any proposed connection between the Newry-Warrenpoint dual carriageway and  the A1-M1 would go through.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have instructed Roads Service to embark on further  studies, and it is engaging consultants to look at the environmental issues.  From his experience in the Committee, the Member will know that all those  studies have to be completed before a project can formally enter the  construction phase. The first study tested the economic viability of the  project and proved that it is viable. We are now looking at the environmental  studies. It is expected that that will take up to two years, after which we  will take the matter forward.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Regional Development (Miss McIlveen)</strong>: Will  the Minister quantify the impact that the recent track closure has had on the Enterprise service? Will  he give the Assembly an assurance that any resulting revenue losses will not  lead to fare increases in that service or fare increases or service reductions  in other parts of the public transport network?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Northern Ireland Railways (NIR) and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann  have a revenue-sharing agreement on the Enterprise  service, and the final figures for 2009-2010 have still to be agreed. However,  revenue was down by more than 50% in September compared to the same month last year.  Overall, the shortfall in revenue for NIR is estimated to be close to &pound;1  million; however, it could be higher, depending on the time taken to recover  passenger numbers. My officials have been working closely with Translink to  ensure that the revenue gap is addressed, but, clearly, the event was  unforeseen, so my Department may need to bid for more money to cover the  shortfall or manage the pressures in NIR.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The last things we want are fare increases and reduction in  services, and we have had that conversation with Translink on many occasions.  We are trying to increase passenger numbers as quickly as possible, but there  is still some work to be done to identify the ultimate shortfall in revenue. We  are considering whether to try and manage that shortfall within existing  budgets or to cover it by bidding for more money during further monitoring  rounds.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. T&aacute; m&eacute; bu&iacute;och den Aire. I am grateful to the Minister for his  statement. I refer him to the issue of road safety. He may be aware that the  biggest percentage of road fatalities occurs on rural roads and that one of the  major causes of road fatalities is speed. Did the issue of comparable signage  come up during the meeting?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: That specific issue was not discussed at the meeting  that was held in Dublin,  but I know that the Department of the Environment continues to raise awareness  of road safety issues through extensive advertising and publicity and a  programme of road safety education in schools.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Significant changes to the training and testing of learner  drivers are being considered in consultation with the Driving Standards Agency  in Britain.  The possibility of introducing a system of graduated driver licensing is being  explored. Consideration is also being given to lowering the current drink-drive  limit. In addition, research is ongoing into a number of issues, including  motorcycling and regulatory regimes for taxis and goods vehicles, both of which  have implications for road safety and are being revised and updated.  Furthermore, the Department of the Environment is working with its key partners  on a new road safety strategy, which is being developed for publication in  2010, two years ahead of the expiry of the existing strategy. There is a range  of measures ongoing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The issue continues to exercise us. Recently, it has been  reported that, although the trend in road fatalities is downwards practically  everywhere else, including the South, the trend this year in the North is up.  Overall, the trend in the past couple of decades has continued to move  downwards. There has been recognition in the discussions that I have had during  transport sectoral meetings that there are particular problems in border areas.  The number of fatalities in those areas is particularly high, and the issue  needs to be addressed through a range of approaches, including enforcement,  detection, awareness and education.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  welcome the Minister&rsquo;s very substantial statement. My question is about the new  lower drink-driving limits in both jurisdictions. I welcome the reduction in  the limit in the South. I was concerned about a good deal of the nature of the  debate, although the argument was eventually won in what I judge to be the  right way. Is any joint work planned to change social attitudes to alcohol in  relation to driving? Substantial work is still needed in that regard.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: In the South, the decisions have not yet been taken.  It is a matter of some debate, and the discussion about lowering the limit was  the key focus of interest, certainly for the media, after the meeting was held.  I know that Minister Dempsey and Minister Poots are considering a similar approach  of lowering the current limit of 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood to new  limits of 50mg for ordinary drivers and 20mg for learner, novice and  professional drivers.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The introduction of random breath-testing is also being  considered. Despite the substantial debate on the issue, public consultation in  the North and the South reflects an understanding that drink-driving has led  and continues to lead to a significant number of fatalities and accidents on  our roads. The consultation exercises showed broad support for a reduction in  the drink-driving limit and for random breath-testing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Part of the shared North/South advertising programme attempts  to raise awareness around issues such as speed, but it also focuses on the  effects of people drinking or taking drugs and then getting behind the wheel of  a car and the dangers that they pose to themselves and to other road users.  Therefore, work on road safety is continuing between both Departments. Some of  that work is around enforcement and penalties, but other areas include creating  an awareness of the issues and educating people through a series of measures,  from dealing with schools to public advertising.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  The Minister has raised a number of points. I want to refer to integrated  ticketing. Does he agree that it would be advantageous to have integrated ticketing  on all Translink services before cross-border services are integrated?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The Member will know from my statement of a few weeks  ago on the reform of public transport that a driving factor behind that is to  try to integrate ticketing as much as possible, so people can move from one  form of public transport to the other. More people will use public transport if  it is easier to do so, more accessible and more understandable for people who  want to plot journeys that involve different modes of public transport.  Therefore, integrated ticketing is very much the focus of the reform of public  transport initiative.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A substantial amount of our public transport is North/South  by the Enterprise  rail or bus services. Progress towards integrated ticketing on those services  would also be helpful. That is made more complicated because of the currency  difference. However, we are not focusing on integrated ticketing on North/South  services and ignoring trying to integrate it on the public transport network  here. We are trying to move forward in both systems simultaneously.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  statement. Were decisions taken at the North/South Ministerial Council meeting  in transport sectoral format on 4 November non-dismissible and robust in terms  of their implement&shy;ation by the respective Departments here and in Leinster House?  I ask that in the context of the decision that was made about the A5,  particularly in relation to the contracts and designs that, in line with the  agreed procedure, are expected to be finalised for both projects by late  autumn.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The short answer is yes, the decisions are  non-dismissible and the process robust. The A5 project, to which the Member  referred, is a good example of that, because it is a joint project, as was the  Newry to Dundalk road, which was also very  successful. It was delivered and paid for jointly by both Administrations. The  working relationship between the National Roads Authority in the South and  Roads Service in the North on the Newry to Dundalk  road has been excellent. Although many people were sceptical, certainly of the  South&rsquo;s financial commitment, we are looking forward to an early payment that I  think will be made in advance of the North/South Ministerial Council&rsquo;s plenary  meeting in Limavady in mid-December.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The systems are very robust, but the Member will be aware  that it is not just in the sectoral format of the North/South Ministerial  Council that the two Departments co-operate. There is a huge range of joint  working between the Departments on day-to-day matters, besides those that we  deal with at North/South Ministerial Council level. The amount of co-operation  and joint working continues to grow, and I think that it has proven very  beneficial to people across the island.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. As the Minister will know, in my  constituency of Mid Ulster there has been quite a number of deaths, including the  loss of many young lives, due to road accidents. Can the Minister go into any  further detail about the new road safety strategies that the Department of the  Environment will be taking forward?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: As I said in a previous answer, there is a range of  measures, including changes to training and testing, the introduction of a  graduated driver licensing system and consideration being given to lowering the  drink-driving limit. In addition, there will be research into ongoing issues,  including those relating to motorcycling, and the regulatory regimes for taxis  and goods services will be revised and updated.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of the Environment is working with key partners  on a new road safety strategy, and I am told that the public consultation on  that is expected in the new year. The new strategy is scheduled to be in place  before the end of 2010. I imagine that that strategy will include a significant  amount of detail on the work that the DOE intends to carry out.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with the Member that, despite all the work that has  been put in, it is frustrating, saddening and disheartening to learn that the  number of deaths on our roads this year has grown and seems to be heading  towards a higher figure than last year&rsquo;s. However, a range of measures are  being undertaken by the DOE and on a North/South basis, and the strategy will  be out for consultation in the new year, when the Member and all other people  who have an interest in the subject will be able to put forward their opinions  and ideas.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. I wish to return to the A8 road  project. The Minister said that he will be appointing contractors and designers.  Many people in the area do not feel that the choice of the preferred route was  properly processed. When the Minister is appointing new contractors and  designers, will he take on board the lessons that were learned as a result of  the pollution incidents on the A4 project and the code of practice that the  Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union has been trying to  produce to ensure that farmers are properly consulted and involved when a road  is being built?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I do not accept that the process was not followed properly.  The process is well tried and tested, and when the Newry/Dundalk road was being  built, before I took up my position in the Department for Regional Development,  I experienced the process from the other side. So, I have seen the process at  work in my own area. Perhaps organisations such as the Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union did not show the same interest when a road was  going through farm land there. Nonetheless, I am happy to hear what the UFU has  to say, and I am sure that Roads Service would be happy to discuss with the UFU  its position, which is open to a substantial degree of scrutiny and must be  rigorously tested and benchmarked against certain criteria before the  Department arrives at a preferred route option. As the member knows, the  preferred route option then undergoes a further period of consultation, which,  ultimately, ends in a public inquiry.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some people who want a road to proceed argue that the whole  process takes far too long, but I think that it is necessary, because, when a  road is to be built through someone&rsquo;s land, that person has rights and  entitlements that must be protected. There are access and compensation issues,  all of which must be properly sorted out. A substantial and robust process is  in place to deal with those matters, and there will be ample opportunities  between now and the end of the public inquiry for the Member, landowners and  other interested parties, such as the UFU, to make their case if they think  that procedures have not been followed properly or that a wrong decision has  been taken.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Such projects must undergo a lengthy and onerous process to  make sure that they are done right. If a project is not done right, ultimately,  it will be subject to a judicial challenge, which would put it back to square  one. That is the last thing that Roads Service wants to happen, because it is a  very inefficient use of its resources. Therefore, particular attention is paid  to ensuring that the processes are correct. Nevertheless, throughout the  process, projects are open to consultation, discussion and challenge.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I preface my question by welcoming the positive comments with respect to the A5  project and by expressing my regret about the omission of the east-west, Belfast to Sligo route.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With respect to the all-Ireland dimension to sustainable  transport, does the Minister agree that one sure way of getting more people out  of their cars and on to public transport would be to develop an all-Ireland  express bus service? At the moment, work needs to be done to develop that.  There is a good service from places such as Monaghan and Cavan to Dublin, for  example, but feed-in services to those are awkward and do not encourage people  to use public transport. An all-Ireland express bus service would bring mutual  benefits.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Sustainable travel and transport is increasingly  prominent on the agendas of transport meetings, and that is necessarily so. We  were pleased to announce that the formal launch of the north-west car share  project will take place soon, if it has not taken place already.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Member knows, a range of initiatives can be taken to  encourage sustainable transport. One of them, as he rightly says, is to make  public transport more desirable and accessible to members of the travelling  public. If there are problems concerning the feeder services to Dublin express buses, I  am happy to ensure that Translink follows up some of the Member&rsquo;s suggestions  with him.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many cross-border services seem to be operating successfully.  In the short term, I want to get the cross-border rail service up to its former  standard and improve its reliability and punctuality. The central thrust of my  Department&rsquo;s effort is to encourage people to leave private cars and use public  transport and more sustainable forms of transport, such as walking or cycling.  From talking to Minister Dempsey, I know that it is the aim of the Department  of Transport. Both Departments have taken initiatives individually and  collectively, and we share more and more initiatives in that respect.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am happy to raise the issue if the Member will provide me  with details of the services to which he refers and consider how best Translink  can ensure that people access them.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has arranged to meet upon the lunchtime  suspension. Therefore, I propose, by leave of the Assembly, to suspend the  sitting until 1.30 pm, instead of 2.00 pm. On resumption, Mr Ross will speak.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The sitting was suspended at 12.28 pm.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">On resuming (Mr Deputy Speaker <span class="Italic">[Mr  Molloy]</span> in the Chair) &mdash;</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">1.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  see from the attendance in the Chamber that the anticipation of my question has  not generated the level of interest that I had hoped for.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister for his statement. In particular, I am  glad that our Executive are pushing forward on the introduction of new, lower  drink-driving limits, and I hope that the Irish Republic  will replicate that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister will know that Members for East Antrim and South Antrim have lobbied for the A8 for many years, and  I welcome the progress that has been made on that scheme. However, other  Members and I have been in correspondence with a number of landowners who will  be impacted on by the project. First, will the Minister update us on how the  one-on-one consultations with those landowners are going and inform us of when  he anticipates that they will be completed? Secondly, can he assure the House  that not only will the concerns of those landowners be listened to but that the  Department will try to take action to resolve some of the issues that they  raise?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: As I said in response to previous questions, I  appreciate that road-build projects that are being built though open  countryside will cause substantial issues for landowners and farmers and, in  some instances, properties will be lost. Substantial processes need to be in  place to deal with the consultations and discussions on such issues as access  and compensation. Such procedures lengthen the road-building process. Although  some people become frustrated that things are not happening more quickly,  consultations and discussions are a necessary part of the process. The Member  will appreciate that now that it affects landowners in his constituency of East  Antrim and others in the South Antrim  constituency.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The public consultation on the A8 scheme and the engagement  with the community and key stakeholders have played a significant part in the  development and subsequent announcement of the preferred route for the scheme.  Three public exhibition events were held between May 2008 and August 2009 and  were attended by between 250 and 600 people.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The one-to-one consultation meetings with individual  landowners are ongoing, and Roads Service will continue to liaise with those  landowners through the next stage of the project. Roads Service is committed to  working with the farmers to ensure that access to land is maintained and that  the impact is mitigated where possible. One-on-one consultations will continue  with the farmers to discuss the likely accommodation works and matters such as  access, lanes, fencing and underpasses in economically viable cases. That type  of discussion is ongoing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As part of the consultation and the examination of the  route, the Department appointed an agriculture consultant to assess the scale  of the impact on farms affected by the A8, and Roads Service is committed to  continue to work with the farmers to ensure that the land access is maintained  and the impact mitigated, where possible, through accommodation works. That  dialogue goes on with local farmers.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  The Minister will be aware of the financial impact that the A5 western  transport corridor will have on many farming families in west Tyrone, where the  road is running through farms and, in a number of instances, dividing farms  down the middle. Will the Minister confirm that there will be a proper  financial package in place to fully compensate those farming families? Will he  outline Roads Service&rsquo;s flexibility to provide bridges and underpasses to  reconnect those farm holdings? Will that be delivered as part of the package or  will it come out of the compensation that is paid?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The process for dealing with landowners who are  affected is well established. It has worked for major road projects, including  the Newry/Dundalk route and the Newry bypass, with which I am familiar, and the  A4 Dungannon to Ballygawley route, which affected, I think, a couple of hundred  landowners. Issues such as compensation, access, severance of farms and removal  of buildings arose and were dealt with. Some time back, I was aware that only  one or two of the couple of hundred cases made in relation to the A4 were  outstanding. I have not heard since that that is still the case, so I assume  that agreements were eventually reached.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a tried and tested process of compensating landowners  and their agents through Land and Property Services. That agency is tasked with  assessing the value of the land and reaching an agreement that is satisfactory  to all parties.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The issue of access to farms, and whether under&shy;passes or  lanes that run parallel to the new A5 should be built, will be worked out  during the construction of the new road. However, the construction of  underpasses is expensive and will not be available in every situation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During previous major roads projects, and the A5 is the  biggest one ever undertaken, all those issues have been worked out  satisfactorily. I understand that not everyone involved is happy that a road is  being built through their property, but the issues of compensation and access  were worked out satisfactorily in the vast majority of previous cases. I expect  any issues arising from the A5 project to be resolved in a similar manner.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bresland</strong>:  I also thank the Minister for his statement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My question is on similar lines to the one that was asked  by Alastair Ross, but I will ask it anyway. Will the Minister assure the House  that he will consult fully with all those whose properties could be affected by  the proposed route of the A5?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: That is already being done. Various public events  were held to discuss the proposed routes and, after its selection, the  preferred corridor. An open invitation was extended to those events, which were  held in three locations along the route of the A5: Strabane, Omagh and the  Ballygawley area. Following those meetings, one-on-one engagements commenced  between Roads Service, the consultants that were appointed to deal with the  consultation process, Mouchel, and the individual landowners involved. All those  issues must be resolved.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a strong sense in the region that the A5, in  creating better access to the north-west, will bring significant economic  advantage. However, the project will have an impact on some individuals, and  they also have rights and entitlements. It is incumbent on Roads Service to  respect their rights, deal properly with those people, ensure that they are  adequately compensated and address any access issues.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  My question relates to the financing of the A5 project by Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland  and whether funding has been approved on both sides of the border. It was  anticipated that &euro;400 million would come from the Irish Government to pay for  the A5 and the A8 projects. Has that been secured? Has the approximate &pound;400  million that Northern    Ireland must contribute to the A5 project  also been secured?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The project has already started on the basis that the  money for the A5 and A8 projects has been identified and secured from future  Budgets. The money has also been identified and secured by the Southern  Government. They intend to make their first payment of &euro;9 million in advance of  the next North/South Ministerial Council meeting in plenary format, which takes  place in mid-December 2009.</p>
    <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Speaker in the Chair)</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member should be reassured that the process has begun  and that people are already working on the scheme. The issues of land  acquisition, access and compensation are all being addressed, and the design  stage is ongoing. The project has begun in anticipation that the moneys will  certainly continue to be made available.</p>

    <p class="H4StageHeading">Consideration Stage</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Members have a copy of the Marshalled List of amendments detailing the order  for consideration. The amendments have been grouped for debate in my  provisional grouping of amendments selected list.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are four groups of amendments, and we will debate the  amendments in each group in turn. The first debate will be on amendment Nos 1,  2, 3 and 12 and on the Minister&rsquo;s opposition to clause 6 standing part of the  Bill. The amendments deal with a new code of practice for entry to premises and  the withdrawal of the parts of the Bill relating to fixed penalty notices.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The second debate will be on amendment Nos 4, 5 and 11,  which deal with removal of the part of the Bill that links non-compliance with  biosecurity guidance to withholding of compensation and also provides for the  making of a disease-specific Order on withholding compensation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The third debate will be on amendment Nos 6, 7, 8 and 9,  which deal with increasing penalties for a second offence for deliberate  infection and related issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The fourth debate will be on amendment Nos 10 and 13, which  deal with the withdrawal of the part of the Bill that concerns the valuation of  items that have been seized to prevent the spread of disease.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I remind Members who are intending to speak that, during  the debates on the four groups of amendments, they should address all the  amendments in each particular group on which they wish to comment. Once the  initial debate on each group is completed, any subsequent amendments in the  group will be moved formally as we go through the Bill, and the Question on  each will be put without further debate. The Questions on stand part will be  taken at the appropriate points in the Bill. If that is clear, we shall  proceed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Clauses 1 to 3 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextClause">Clause 4 (Powers of entry)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  We now come to the first group of amendments for debate. With amendment No 1,  it will be convenient to debate amendment Nos 2, 3 and 12 and the Minister&rsquo;s  opposition to clause 6. The amendments deal with a new code of practice for  entry to premises and the withdrawal of parts of the Bill relating to fixed  penalty notices.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members should note that amendment Nos 2 and 3, which are  paving amendments, are tabled as a consequence of the opposition to clause 6  standing part of the Bill. Members should also note that amendment No 12 is  consequential to the opposition to clause 6 standing part. Therefore, I will  not call amendment No 12 if it is agreed that clause 6 stand part of the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development (Ms Gildernew)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a  Cheann Comhairle. I beg to move amendment No 1: In page 4, line 22, at end  insert</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Powers of entry under warrant: code of practice</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">46D.&mdash;(1) An inspector who enters any premises by  virtue of a warrant issued under Article 46B shall comply with a code of  practice which has been published under paragraph (4) and has not been  withdrawn.</p>

    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">(5) The Department shall from time to time review the  code and if it thinks it appropriate revise the code.</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">(6) Paragraphs (2) to (4) apply to a revision of the  code as they apply to its preparation.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The following amendments stood on the Marshalled  List:</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">No 2: In clause 5, page 5, line 30, leave out from &ldquo;or&rdquo; to  &ldquo;4A&rdquo; in line 31. &mdash; <span class="SmallQuote"><span style="font-size:8.5pt; ">[The  Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development (Ms Gildernew).]</span></span><span class="Italic"> </span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">No 3: In clause 5, page 5, line 33, leave out &ldquo;or that  sub-paragraph&rdquo;. &mdash; <span class="SmallQuote"><span style="font-size:8.5pt; ">[The  Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development (Ms Gildernew).]</span></span></p>

    <p class="B3BodyText">Before I speak to the amendment, I take this opportunity to  thank the Chairperson and other members of the Committee for Agriculture and  Rural Development for their detailed consideration of the Bill. The Committee  asked me to reconsider some parts of the Bill, and I was happy to do that. In  turn, I had to raise some very difficult issues with the Committee,  particularly those concerning enforcement and biosecurity measures. I am  grateful for the Committee&rsquo;s detailed consideration of those matters and for  its constructive proposals. I met with the Committee on a number of occasions,  and I am glad to be able to say that, with goodwill on both sides, we were able  to reach an agreed position.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My amendments reflect the detailed work that the Committee,  the Office of the Legislative Counsel, legal advisers and officials in my  Department carried out. I thank everyone who was involved for their efforts. I  also thank the Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union in  particular for its involvement in developing the Bill; its advice and  contributions were invaluable.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I believe that the proposed amendments will result in  animal health legislation that is proportionate and effective. I also believe  that the proposed measures have the potential to help us to address those  diseases that are serious threats to the industry. I am thinking particularly  of brucellosis, and also, of course, of foot-and-mouth disease and emerging  diseases such as bluetongue and avian influenza. We need to have policies and  measures in place to deal quickly and decisively with animal and poultry diseases  so that our agrifood industry can compete in an increasingly competitive and  changing marketplace.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 1 concerns a new provision that will apply  when inspectors are required to search premises under the authority of a  warrant. I am glad to say that farm searches under warrant are rarely needed.  In fact, they have never been needed under the Diseases of Animals Order 1981.  Even so, we need to have safeguards in place so that farmers will know their  rights if a search is required. The Committee feels very strongly about this  issue, as do I. Nobody wants strangers on their premises. Sometimes, however,  farm searches have to be conducted where there is evidence that an offence may  have been committed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to ensure that searches are carried out in an  acceptable manner and that farmers can have someone present to protect their  interests. The Committee suggested this amendment during its scrutiny of the  Bill, and I am grateful to Committee members for their input. The new provision  will require the Department to draw up a code of practice with which inspectors  will have to comply when entering premises under warrant. The code will be  drawn up in close consultation with the Committee for Agriculture and Rural  Development and stakeholder groups.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee in particular will have an important  contribution to make to the development and review of the code. My officials  have consulted informally on the terms of a draft code. When the Bill becomes  law early next year, the draft code will be issued for formal consultation with  the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development and stakeholder groups. A  search liaison officer, completely independent of my Department, will be  appointed to oversee the search and to deal with any issues that arise, particularly  about the code of practice. Farmers will have the right to have their own  witness present during the search, and all those matters will be included in  the code.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">1.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The code of practice will be issued to every farmer in the  North of Ireland. A version will also be placed on the Internet, and a copy of  the code will be given to the occupier when a search is to be conducted. I  sincerely hope that any farm searches will be few and far between. Searches are  not undertaken lightly, nor are they pleasant for anybody involved. I hope that  the existence of the code will provide protection and reassurance for farm  businesses and farming families.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 2 relates to the provision in clause 5 to make  it an offence to fail to give a name and address, in so far as it concerns the  operation of the fixed penalty provisions set out in clause 6. The intention of  clause 6 was to introduce a system of fixed penalties as an alternative to  prosecution in court for certain types of offences under the Diseases of  Animals Order. Those are the more straightforward offences that can be readily  dealt with on the spot and do not require further detailed investigation, such  as the illegal movement of animals during a disease outbreak.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When the proposal for a fixed penalty scheme was discussed  with the Committee, concerns were expressed that innocent farmers would be  inclined to accept the fixed penalty rather than pursue an expensive and public  court case. Although I have the utmost confidence in the professional ability  of my inspectors, who would be trained to administer the scheme, I accept that  there is an element of risk in the issuing of fixed penalty notices. That is  why the scheme was intended to apply to clear-cut offences only, which were  readily apparent and not open to dispute.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee suggested that the scheme should include an  independent appeals system. I have looked at the operation of similar fixed  penalty schemes and have taken legal advice. There is no precedent for an  appeals system in the type of scheme that I had envisaged under the Bill, and  the fixed penalty notice envisaged would have provided full details of the  offence, and the recipient would have had the choice of accepting the notice or  having the case heard in court. Lawyers have advised that the creation of a  statutory appeals process as a means to determine guilt or innocence would  usurp the role of the court. The Committee was made aware of those issues and  indicated that, if the clause remained in the Bill, it would table an amendment  for the inclusion of an appeals system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I considered carefully all the representations made to me  on the proposal for a fixed penalty scheme. Indeed, I have had to deal with  fixed penalties for parking and other offences on behalf of my constituents, so  I am well aware of the issues surrounding fixed penalties. In my view, the cost  of an appeals system would far outweigh the income from fixed penalties, and,  based on legal advice, I am mindful of the judicial implications and the role  of the courts in determining guilt or innocence. I am, therefore, opposing the  inclusion of clause 6 in the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 3 is a consequential amendment to clause 5.  The remaining amendment in the group is amendment No 12, which makes a minor  technical change to clause 21 on the procedure for orders.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development (Mr Paisley Jnr)</strong>: As  Chairperson of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development, I put on  record my thanks and the thanks of members of the Committee to the departmental  Bill team, the supporting officials and those who provided evidence to the  Committee. I also thank Committee members for their hard work and the  Committee&rsquo;s support team for the time and effort that it put in to getting us  and the Bill to this point.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee&rsquo;s scrutiny of the Bill has been extensive, Mr  Speaker, and, as you and Members will learn later in the debate, it continued  well beyond Committee Stage. Members and the industry should be aware that  every clause has been debated in Committee, and none more so than clause 1,  &ldquo;Slaughter to prevent spread of disease&rdquo;. After much debate, the Committee  agreed not to amend that clause to force the Department to instigate a  proactive eradication programme of TB. However, the Committee felt that it was  important that the House be apprised of the Committee&rsquo;s concerns about the  clause and of the actions that it proposed undertaking.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee remains concerned that more than &pound;25 million  is spent each year on trying to keep the disease in control. We believe that  that policy has failed and will continue to fail, resulting in continual  financial burdens on the Northern    Ireland exchequer. That is the same  conclusion that was reached in the report on the control of TB that was  published by the Public Accounts Committee earlier this year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In order to address the failures in the current TB  strategy, the Committee called on the Department to review legislation relevant  to the eradication of bovine tuberculosis and, in particular, to extend its  existing powers to allow for the proactive cull of badgers and susceptible  wildlife. The Committee originally proposed that clause 1 be amended to compel  the Department to implement a TB eradication programme whenever disease  incidence levels reached a defined intensity in a defined area; in effect, when  the Department recognised that a hot spot was extensive. The proposed programme  would have included the culling of all susceptible animals in that area,  including badgers and wild deer.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department rejected that proposal, citing the extensive  powers already available under the Diseases of Animals Order 1981 and in the  Bill to deal specifically with badgers. I want to make it clear that officials  from the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) have stated in  evidence that the powers to tackle the disease, including the culling of  susceptible animals, are in statute and are within the gift of the Department.  Therefore, it is up to the Department to use them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is the Department that is refusing to make use of those  powers, despite the industry being almost unanimously supportive of the  eradication of the disease. It is the Department that is content to have spent  &pound;200 million over the past 10 years so that the disease can be maintained at  the same level now as it was 10 years ago. It is the Department that is content  to continue to spend, or waste, &pound;25 million per year for the next five years,  when, as it told both my Committee and the Public Accounts Committee, it might  be in a position to indicate when it might be able to eradicate the disease.  That will be another &pound;125 million, on top of the &pound;200 million already spent, to  move us no closer to eradicating the disease. It is important that the House  gets a sense of our frustration on that point.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee, therefore, agrees with the aim of clause 1,  in that it will extend the powers to slaughter in the event of an outbreak of  transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE). However, the Committee did not  agree with the policy direction of the clause, as it believed that it did not  tackle the increasing TB incident levels. The Committee has recommended that it  should undertake an inquiry into the eradication of bovine TB, with the aim of  bringing forward a Committee Bill to amend the Diseases of Animals Order 1981  to introduce a defined compulsory bovine TB eradication programme, which would  include the removal of all animals susceptible to bovine TB.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee, like most others, is facing a heavy  legislative programme at the moment that is preventing the immediate  commencement of that inquiry. However, I can assure the House, while also  reminding the Department, that the inquiry remains a priority for my Committee,  because, in my view and the Committee&rsquo;s view, the Department cannot be allowed  to continue to waste money on this issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank you, Mr Speaker, for giving me latitude to set out  that explanatory position. I will now turn my attention to the first group of  amendments, and I thank the Minister for her explanation of those amendments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee and the Department are in the happy position  of having agreed all the amendments after much debate and negotiation. The  Minister gave us a flavour of that discussion. She also provided an explanation  of the amendments and their impact on the clauses of the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee expressed grave concerns about the clauses  dealing with powers of entry, as it strongly believed that the original clause  offered little or no protection to farmers or farm dwellers. The Committee did  not dispute the need for searches of farm businesses and, where merited, farm  homes. Indeed, the Committee is adamant and should be absolutely clear that  those who bring the industry into disrepute and put it at risk should not be  protected. However, it felt that the weaknesses that were highlighted following  the alpha-nortestosterone (ANT) episode had not been mitigated and that  safeguards needed to be built into the clause to offer protection to the  innocent. The Committee, therefore, called on the Department to safeguard  farmers and farm businesses by drawing up a new code of practice for the search  of premises under warrant. The Department agreed to that request, and the  amended clause refers to the code. That is a significant development as it  provides stakeholders and the Committee with the opportunity to participate  actively in the compilation of a key departmental procedure.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, the new code of practice is to be issued to  all Northern Ireland  farm businesses and placed on the Department&rsquo;s website. At the outset of a  search under warrant, the code must be issued to the farm occupier. That will  ensure that all those involved, including the occupier and departmental  officials, will be aware of the extent of their rights and, importantly, the  limitations of the power.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, the Department agreed to the Committee&rsquo;s  recommendation that a search liaison officer, totally independent of the  Department, be appointed to ensure that searches have been conducted in  accordance with the code of practice.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, the Department agreed with the Committee that farm  occupiers would have access to third-party oversight during searches as an  assurance that the search was being undertaken in an appropriate manner during  what might be a stressful time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee fully supports the Minister in her intention  to oppose the Question that clause 6 stand part of the Bill. The Committee  believes that the clause would result in innocent recipients of fixed penalties  accepting the penalty rather than pursuing an expensive and public court case.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee made a number of proposals to the Department  on clause 6, including a proposal to define the proposed penalties in the Bill  and a proposal on verification of the evidence supporting the issue of the  notice by two departmental officials. However, the Department insisted that the  clause would not be amended. The Committee pursued the matter and insisted that  procedures be established that would allow a recipient of a notice to appeal  its issue within 21 days. The Committee believes that that would afford  individuals who were mistakenly accused the opportunity to present their  evidence to the Department for consideration.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee&rsquo;s argument was strengthened when a senior  enforcement officer from the Department stated in evidence to the Committee  that there was the potential for abuse of the fixed penalty system. I am  delighted to say that the Department considered the arguments that the  Committee presented, and, following consultation with the Minister, the  Department advised the Committee that the Minister would not support the motion  that clause 6 stand part of the Bill. The Minister has the support of the  Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development for that and for the amendments  in the first group.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. With your indulgence, Mr Speaker, I  pay tribute to the Minister and the Department for their swift actions when  faced with animal diseases &mdash; for instance, the introduction of measures to  prevent bluetongue from spreading to Ireland. New strains of disease  will attack the country, and animal disease legislation must be improved to  combat that. Officials need laws that are fit for purpose, given the  consequences that any disease will have on the agrifood industry. We cannot  have a situation in which we are powerless or slow to react to an outbreak of  disease. We all remember the devastation that the foot-and-mouth epidemic  brought to the agriculture and tourism sectors.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will now turn to the main aspects of the Bill,  particularly amendment No 1, which relates to clause 4. There is a need to  ensure that, during an outbreak of disease, inspectors can get onto farms  quickly to carry out any essential investigations and that powers are available  to deal with any stumbling blocks. Currently, the system involves seeking a  court injunction, which is a time-consuming process when facing an outbreak of  disease. Legislation is needed to combat serious diseases that have the  potential to destroy the farming industry. We all hope that the new measures  will give the Department extra powers to eradicate disease, particularly  brucellosis.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Farmers&rsquo; human rights must also be respected. There was  much anger about how the alpha-nortestosterone situation was handled. I hope  that lessons have been learnt and that safeguards have been put in place to  ensure that such events never happen again.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments that additional  operational and administrational protocols will reinforce safeguards in the  Bill. The Committee sought extra safeguards with regard to search and entry  powers; for example, that it was essential to set up a code of practice to  which inspectors must adhere rigidly. I ask the Minister to inform the House  when such a code of practice for entry to premises will be made available for  Committee scrutiny. Although she touched on that issue in her remarks, the  House needs further information.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Another important qualification is that powers will not  extend to dwelling houses unless the occupier is given 24 hours&rsquo; notice of  intended entry. I ask the Minister to expand on that. Can she also explain how  search liaison officers will be appointed? She said that they would be totally  independent from DARD, so what sector is she looking at in that regard? Can the  Minister also clarify that raids on the farming community will not increase  simply because it seems easy to obtain warrants from lay magistrates?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in will oppose the question that clause 6, on fixed  penalties for certain offences, stand part of the Bill. It is another clause  that required much work to be carried out by the Committee. It is not  surprising that stakeholders were not jumping with joy about it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I concur with the Minister that any breaches in disease  control measures are deplored by, and cause considerable annoyance to, farmers  and the rural community in general. It must be remembered that those breaches  cost the community greatly. That money could be directed to rural development  and initiatives to improve farming areas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During Committee Stage, fears were expressed that farmers  could be hounded about minor offences by overzealous officials. Consensus could  not be reached on that issue. The Committee suggested a possible compromise;  the introduction of an appeals mechanism for farmers. However, the Minister  explained that she did not believe that the Department could legally proceed  with an appeals system for fixed penalties.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Every Committee member wanted a measure to safeguard  farmers from legal miscarriages by accepting fixed penalties. Members felt that  farmers might be forced to pay fines even when insufficient evidence is  presented. It was proposed that fixed penalties would be introduced to speed up  streamlining of minor offences in order for them to be processed more quickly  and, therefore, reduce bureaucracy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Committee considered the matter further, we decided  that even if it were legally possible to introduce an appeals system, it would  not reduce bureaucracy and, indeed, would probably increase it. Therefore,  there would be no point in introducing a clause to that effect. As the Minister  described, motor vehicle fixed penalties provide my office with an  ever-increasing workload. I could certainly do without adding to it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At the end of the day, everyone wants to achieve  compliance. It is in everyone&rsquo;s interests that that be carried out without  fixed penalties or court cases. However, the Assembly cannot allow a minority  of rogue farmers to jeopardise the well-being of our proud agriculture  industry. I am sure that all Members agree on that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Law-abiding farmers would have nothing to fear from fixed  penalties. However, as I pointed out earlier, the Committee felt strongly that  an appeals system could have increased bureaucracy instead of reducing it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 2 to clause 5 relates to the failure to give a  name and address for fixed penalties as set out in clause 6, which, as I have  mentioned, my party will oppose. Has an inspector got power to ask for the name  and address of any person in connection with enforcement of animal health  legislation? That is an essential requirement in investigating the outbreak of diseases,  such as foot-and-mouth disease and bluetongue. Speed is of the essence to  combat those diseases and to protect the rural community. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>:  As someone who has been involved in farming for all of my life, I declare an  interest in the debate and the Bill. It is important to note that the Bill&rsquo;s  primary purpose is to update and strengthen the Department of Agriculture and  Rural Development&rsquo;s powers that are contained in the Diseases of Animals  (Northern Ireland) Order 1981.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will strengthen the Department&rsquo;s powers to enter  farms for the purposes of surveillance, vaccination, serology and slaughter.  That said; there must be greater consultation between farmers and the  Department, especially when problems arise. Sometimes, the Depart&shy;ment washes  its hands of the whole problem and farmers get the blame, even when the  Department is perhaps at fault. Greater trust must be built between farmers and  the Department. Amendment No 1 provides the necessary framework for the  production of a code of practice that departmental inspectors will have to  abide by. I trust that the Department will work closely with the Committee for  Agriculture and Rural Develop&shy;ment to ensure that there is a code of practice  that everyone inside and outside the industry can sign up to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When an incident occurs on a farm, that does not mean that  an official from the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development can enter  that farm, pressurise farmers, and do whatever he wants just because he arrives  at the farm wearing a badge of identification round his neck. I will oppose  such practices at every available opportunity. Farmers and the Department must  work more closely together. If the Department respects farmers, farmers will  respect the Department. That bond and co-operation must exist. I will be  indebted to the Minister if she gives me a commitment today that the clause in  question will have that effect. I will support farmers in every way that is  humanly possible.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>: I  oppose clause 6, which will provide the Department with the power to impose a  fixed penalty notice to anyone believed to have committed an offence. It is my  understanding that the offences being considered are those involving disease  control measures; for example, the movement of restricted animals, especially  during times of crisis. However, the offences are not stated in the Bill;  therefore, we could be talking about any number of other offences that may be  created under the legislation in future. As far as I understand the clause,  people who are given such notices would not be liable for conviction if they  pay the fine within 21 days, and there would be no right of appeal. Most people  will be familiar with the format of the notices, especially if they have been  given a ticket for a road traffic offence.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee was extremely concerned about the  introduction of on-the-spot fines and the possibility of errors being made.  There was some suggestion that the system may even be open to abuse. Some  people who gave evidence were also very worried about the amount of red tape  that the system would create.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My main concern and that of the Committee was that innocent  farmers would have to accept unfair fines and would not mount legal challenges  because going to court would result in high costs and a lot of embarrass&shy;ment.  That was also the view of the Department&rsquo;s most senior officials, and it was  certainly the view of the Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union.  Its representatives actually informed the Committee that there would be very  little support for those measures from the farmers themselves. I do not support  the fixed penalty system.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr W McCrea</strong>:  I join with other Members in welcoming the Diseases of Animals Bill, because it  will provide important assistance to the agriculture industry. The Chairperson  of the Committee rightly said that we want to protect the industry, as it is  still the primary industry in Northern    Ireland, and rightly so.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is true that the Committee extensively scrutinised the  Bill. Anyone who reads the Minutes of Evidence will find that there were robust  exchanges between the Committee and the Minister and her officials about the  Bill. It was right that that should happen, because genuine concerns were  expressed, and the Bill is better as a result of those robust exchanges.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As was said, it is vitally important to have a bond of  trust between the farming industry and the Department. However, we also must  remember that the Department is the Department and the farming industry is the  farming industry. Therefore, there will be times when there are differences of  opinions and of emphasis on particular issues. Nevertheless, it is vital that  we discuss those issues in depth in the Committee and the Chamber.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Committee Chairperson pointed out, the Committee is  right to demand that the Department takes a more proactive approach to  eradicating TB. The expenditure of &pound;25 million every year is totally  unacceptable and, as far as I am concerned, the present policy has failed. An  intolerable burden exists, and the Committee will not fail in its efforts to  keep that issue on the front burner. We are frustrated by and, at times, angry  at the Department&rsquo;s failure to take more action on the matter, which will  continue to be a bone of contention until it is resolved. We are still looking  to the Department to take that forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to draw Members&rsquo; attention to two issues, the first  of which is powers of entry. During the Committee&rsquo;s deliberations on the clause  relating to powers of entry, it acknowledged that there are circumstances when  departmental officials will require access under warrant to farm businesses  and, in very exceptional cases, to farm dwellings. However, access to farm  dwellings, and that invasion of privacy in a person&rsquo;s home, should happen only  in exceptional circumstances when there is evidence that an offence has  occurred. We have learnt from past experiences that concerns about that have  been warranted.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee felt that the Bill, as first presented, was  imbalanced and leaned in favour of the Department, and the Committee was  concerned that farm businesses and farm families were not sufficiently  protected. However, after some toing and froing among the Minister, the Department  and the Committee, we came to a sensible resolution of the matter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There will now be a code of practice for searches of farm  premises under warrant. The Committee and stakeholder groups must scrutinise  that code of practice carefully. I am delighted that there will also be a  search liaison officer who is totally independent of the Department. I think  that those are helpful solutions. Farmers will also have the right to have a  witness present during searches, and that is a protection not only for the farmer  but for the search officer, because it removes the risk of accusations being  made. I think that that is a step in the right direction and will build trust  between the Department and the farming industry.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The second issue that I want to raise is that of fixed  penalties, which the Committee was keenly exercised about. The Committee  believes that some people who are mistakenly accused of an offence may accept  the offer a fixed penalty even though they are totally innocent. Some people  may question why such a person would accept a fixed penalty if they are  innocent, but there is a number of reasons for that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">First, if a farmer does not accept the penalty, he faces  getting a criminal conviction, because no one knows what will happen in court  and nothing is guaranteed. Some strange and even foolish decisions have been  made in the courts.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Second, there is the issue of a court appearance. A farmer  who has never been in a court in his life and who has never been on the wrong  side of the law would probably prefer to accept a fixed penalty than go to  court and experience the perceived shame that that would bring on his family.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Thirdly, we must consider the cost of any legal  proceedings. Although the cost of the Department&rsquo;s legal fees would be paid for  out of its budget and taxpayer&rsquo;s money &mdash; in fact, the farmer as a taxpayer  would also be paying for that &mdash; the farmer would have to pay for his own legal  fees in what may be costly proceedings.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That is why the Committee strenuously opposes that clause.  That protects against miscarriages of justice. Therefore, as is recorded in the  Committee&rsquo;s summary of considerations and agreed amendments, the Minister  rightly proposes to oppose the Question that clause 6 stand part of the Bill,  which would have the effect of removing the fixed penalty system from the Bill.  That is a very helpful solution and one which shows the importance of the  Committee&rsquo;s scrutiny.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Department and the Minister for listening to  what the Committee had to say on the important issues that affect the farming  community.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. The Diseases of Animals Bill is an  important piece of legislation, and the Agriculture Committee had an important  role to play in the scrutiny of the proposals and amendments. As has been said,  there was some banter between departmental officials and others about the  issues. However, it is important that we have a clear understanding from the  Depart&shy;ment about, perhaps not the mistrust of roles, but the separation of  roles, which has not always been clear.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department needs to look on the Bill as a new  opportunity to build a better relationship with farmers. We all want to see the  eradication of disease, in particular, brucellosis, and the enforcement of  policies as strictly as possible. However, the way in which those policies are  enforced is important, and vets and departmental officials have an important  role to play in implementing them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Last night, I read the Bill again, and I wondered why some  of the clauses were included. In some senses, certain clauses come across as  severe and draconian and could raise concerns. Therefore, it is important that  the Department does not abuse the legislation when it comes into effect and that  it uses it sensitively. The Department must respond to the needs of farmers and  take into account that their role, as full-time working men and women, is to  farm and to try to produce.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At times, the paperwork can be problematic to say the  least. The way in which the Department implements legislation and communicates  can sometimes be restrictive. Therefore, how the Bill is implemented is  important, as are the implementation of biosecurity structures and the building  of a relationship of trust and encouragement between the Department and the  farmers. The Bill provides a new opportunity to build that trust, and the  Department has a role to play in that. The public want to see diseases  eradicated and the policies on brucellosis and other diseases implemented as  quickly as possible. It is very important that enforcement issues are dealt  with sensitively.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to fixed penalties, we have reached the best  solution from among our proposals. People now have an opportunity to go through  the process to see whether there are particular issues that they want to deal  with. Cases may eventually go through the courts. However, we often find that,  as in other circumstances, people will accept the fixed penalty because that is  the easiest option, which may leave them in a difficult situation. We now, at  least, have a structure in place to deal with that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Diseases of Animals Bill is a very important piece of  legislation. Other arguments will crop up later in the debate in relation to  the amendments and biosecurity. However, at this stage, it is very important to  welcome the Bill and the co-operation that there has been in the Committee and  with the departmental officials in trying to get the best piece of legislation,  not just the first or quickest piece. The legislation will ensure the  protection of farmers and of the vets and departmental officials who will  implement it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Irwin</strong>: At  the outset, I declare an interest as a farmer.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The issue of disease in animals is one that fills every  farmer with dread. To have one animal in a herd affected means that the entire  heard is restricted, and it can take a considerable time to resolve that  situation. A number of tests may be involved, as well as a lot of inconvenience  for the farmer concerned.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With the inconvenience and cost to the Department and  farmers in mind, the overriding theme of the Bill, and the collective efforts  of the Department and those who are involved in the farming industry, must  always remain focused on the eradication of diseases, such as brucellosis and TB  in cattle. In the early 1990s, for example, it was thought that brucellosis had  been almost eradicated. Its eradication is within the Department&rsquo;s grasp.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Bill and the Department&rsquo;s efforts to update  it to make it more applicable to today&rsquo;s industry by referring to the issues  that surround powers of entry and the various questions that they present.  Obviously, when the deliberate infection of cattle is suspected, the Department  must do all in its remit to ensure that the person responsible is made amenable  for the crime. The deliberate infection of cattle is a serious issue; the  unscrupulous farmer responsible not only affects his herd, but puts at risk the  livelihood of neighbouring farmers who are trying hard to make a living in the  current economic climate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department&rsquo;s approach to such incidents, and the wider  issue of powers of entry, must be handled in a cautious manner. Although we all  want unscrupulous operators to feel the full weight of the law, there is  obvious concern for the genuine farmer who is guilty of no wrongdoing. We need  no reminder of the farm swoops that were carried out by the Department during  the alpha-nortestosterone affair. A constituent of mine, who was in his 70s,  was the victim of such a swoop by the Department and the PSNI despite having  done no wrong. That is an example of why the legislation must be balanced.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On other occasions, the approach of departmental officials  when visiting farms was totally unsuitable. The families affected were  concerned by the attitudes of those officials. The code of practice for entry  is the most welcome addition to the Bill and, going by the reports that I have  received from various farmers who were suspected of wrongdoing and were subject  to visits from the Department, the need for a measured yet efficient approach  is crucial. Many of my concerns about the powers of entry relate to reports  that I have received about the attitude of inspectorate staff and the way in  which farmers were left feeling like criminals when they had done no wrong.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I understand that a balance must be struck between the  realities of an investigation into a deliberate infection, which is a deeply  irresponsible crime, and the need to uphold the rights of a farmer who, by law,  is innocent until proven guilty.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a Cheann  Comhairle. I will take the opportunity to respond to the Chairperson of the  Committee&rsquo;s comments on bovine TB before addressing the substantive elements of  this afternoon&rsquo;s debate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although the Bill provides additional powers for dealing  with animal disease, it is not specifically related to bovine TB, as the  Assembly accepted when it ordered clause 1 to stand part of the Bill. I accept  that the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development is not content with my  policy approach to the eradication of bovine tuberculosis, and it has committed  to undertaking a formal inquiry with a view to bringing forward new legislation  on an enhanced and compulsory bovine tuberculosis eradication programme. I  reiterate that I welcome such an inquiry and that I and my officials will work  with the Committee on that. Given the scope of the inquiry, I hope that its  terms of reference will be made as wide as possible to take into account all the  available evidence on badgers and bovine TB and to include the views of all  interested stakeholders and Departments, because it is a cross-cutting issue.  As there could be significant financial implications for the public purse, I  hope that the Committee will provide clear evidence in its report on the cost  effectiveness of any measures that could become mandatory.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, I want to make it absolutely clear that progress  has been made on bovine TB here. Ten years ago, the rate of bovine TB in the  North of Ireland was rising, with levels peaking in 2002. We have since made  considerable progress; the rate has fallen from 9&middot;93% in 2002 to 5&middot;48% today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Moreover, the TB programme that we have been implementing  in recent years has been successful in supporting our export trade in live  cattle and products. In light of the programme, about 90% of herds here are  able to participate fully in export markets, which are valued at over &pound;900  million. That said, I do not want the Consideration Stage to become a debate on  the policy for the eradication of TB. That is a separate and distinct issue and  has little relation to the Bill. I am happy to discuss the matter further with  the Chairperson and the Committee at another time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will address some issues that were raised during the  debate. One of the Chairman&rsquo;s first comments related to powers of entry. Powers  of entry are likely to be used during a disease outbreak for the purposes of  the testing, vaccination, identification or slaughter of animals. If those  powers are not available, it could jeopardise our ability to deal effectively  with a disease outbreak. The new powers will enable inspectors to enter  premises to identify animals, using methods such as DNA sampling or retinal  imaging. For example, a TB or brucellosis reactor that is identified by one of  those methods will ensure that the correct animal is removed from the farm for  slaughter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Several Members mentioned the alpha-nortestosterone issue  and how it has been handled. The investigations that were carried out in 2007  on alpha-nortestosterone related to food safety concerns, and the powers of  entry were exercised under the Food Safety Order 1991, not the diseases of  animals legislation. Neverthe&shy;less, I fully accept that valuable lessons have  been learned from the alpha-nortestosterone issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The powers in clause 4 will enable the Department to  respond quickly to a disease situation while respecting the privacy rights of  farmers and farm businesses. I hope that the safeguards that are provided by  the restrictions on entry to private dwelling houses, the strict conditions  under which a warrant may be issued, the new code of practice for entry to  premises that are under warrant, the role of the independent search liaison  officer and the right of occupiers to have a witness present will offer  protection and reassurance to everyone.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Several Members asked when the code of practice will be  available. It is essential to have a code of practice in place that everyone  can support. Therefore, officials have consulted informally with the Committee  for Agriculture and Rural Development, the UFU and NIAPA on the terms of a  draft code. No significant changes were required to the initial draft code, but  officials were able to clarify some issues. The draft code will be issued for  formal consultation with the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development  and stakeholders when the Bill becomes law early next year. The code will be  clear and unambiguous, and a copy will be issued to every farmer in the North  and placed on the Department&rsquo;s website. As I said, the occupier will also be  given a copy at the time of a search. We will follow the same procedure of  consulting the Committee and stakeholders before making any revisions to the  code.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">George Savage and others mentioned the issue of creating  trust between farmers and the Department. I hope that the code of practice  shows that trust is being built, and I hope that the industry and others feel  that I have spent the past two and a half years building that trust and  building partnerships. The word &ldquo;partnership&rdquo; has been mentioned several times  today; partnership is extremely important and has featured heavily in every  public utterance that I have made. Partnership will enable the industry and the  Department to move forward together with the help and support of the Committee  for Agriculture and Rural Development. I am keen to establish trust and build  on it, so that we reach a stage at which it is unquestioned.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Willie Clarke mentioned the ability to enter a private  dwelling house. Under the new powers, a lay magistrate may issue a warrant to  enter a dwelling house. However, entry to a private dwelling house for purposes  connected with the new Order would be highly unusual. The main purpose of the  legislation is to inspect, test and take samples of animals or poultry, and  none of those key enforcement functions require entry to a dwelling house. For  disease control purposes, inspectors normally require entry to farm buildings  only. However, if it were considered necessary to search a dwelling house, 24  hours&rsquo; notice must be given to the occupier or the entry must be exercised  under the authority of a warrant from a lay magistrate. The warrant is subject  to strict conditions, and the magistrate must be satisfied that there are  reasonable grounds for the inspector to require entry to the premises.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Willie Clarke also asked whether there will be more  searches. Again, strict conditions must be satisfied before a warrant for the  inspection of a dwelling-house can be issued without notice. First, the  magistrate must be fully satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for an  inspector to require entry to premises: the magistrate must also be made aware  of any representations from the occupier of the premises in connection with the  application for a warrant and must consider those matters in every case in  order to decide whether a warrant should be granted.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Dr McCrea raised the issue of the search liaison officer. I  assure Members that the search liaison officer will not be a DARD official, nor  will he or she have any connection with DARD. It is important that that person  is completely independent from the Department; and we will be guided by  OFMDFM&rsquo;s public appointments unit on the procedures required to appoint a panel  of search liaison officers who can be called on to undertake the role as and  when required.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Francie Molloy spoke about protecting the majority of  law-abiding farmers from the illegal or inappropriate actions of others. There  is no doubt that breaches of disease control measures cause considerable  resentment among law-abiding farmers and the general public alike. The powers  in the Bill will increase DARD&rsquo;s effectiveness to take action against the small  minority of offenders.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">New powers involving the issue of warrants by a lay  magistrate will be available to deal with any delay or obstruction in getting  on to farm premises quickly to carry out investigations. The fixed penalty  scheme will act as a deterrent to those who are involved in the illegal  movement of animals &mdash; I am sorry; I am seeking to remove the provision for  fixed penalties from the Bill. We want to emphasise that the Bill protects the  majority of law-abiding farmers, and it is important that people are reassured  about the intentions behind it. I was also asked whether DARD can request names  and addresses in connection with disease investigations. Clause 4 makes it a  legal requirement to provide a name and address in connection with an  investigation under the Diseases of Animals Order 1981.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Dr McCrea and Francie Molloy talked about the robust  exchanges that took place between me, my officials and the Committee. They were  robust at times; Francie Molloy said that there was banter, but sometimes it  was more robust than banter. However, we must recognise that we have a big job  of work to do and that this legislation is important, as are the other pieces  of legislation that are coming up. We will need that forthrightness, trust and  honesty on both sides to enable us to move on other areas of legislation. I  appreciate the time and effort that the Committee put into this matter; and it  is important to recognise that when we work well together we can get an awful  lot done.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am conscious that I did not refer in the main to the  comments made by William Irwin and Thomas Burns. Mr Burns talked about clause  6, which I am seeking to remove from the Bill. Mr Irwin mentioned brucellosis,  and if he is content, I will deal with the issues that he raised when we debate  the second group of amendments. I am content: much work was put into the Bill,  and I believe that it is a good piece of legislation. I am pleased with the  co-operation that my Department has had in bringing it forward. Go raibh mile  maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.</p>

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  We now come to the second group of amendments for debate. With amendment No 4,  it will be convenient to debate amendment Nos 5 and 11. The amendments deal  with the removal of the part of the Bill that links non-compliance with  biosecurity guidance to withholding of compensation and also provides for the  making of a disease-specific Order on withholding compensation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members will wish to note that amendment Nos 4 and 5 are  interconnected. In addition, amendment No 11 is consequential to amendment No 4.  Therefore, if amendment No 4 is not made, I will not call amendment No 11.</p>

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.  Clause 8 of the Bill will enable the Department to prepare and publish  statutory biosecurity guidance for dealing with specific diseases. That  guidance will include practical measure that farmers can take to prevent the  introduction of disease to their premises.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The importance of having a common set of biosecurity  standards that everyone will have to comply with is vital, particularly during  disease outbreaks. Breaches of biosecurity practice can lead to the spread of  disease, not only on the affected farm but to neighbouring farms and further  afield. I am aware that the majority of farmers already operate high standards  of biosecurity. However, there is, unfortunately, a minority who jeopardise  those efforts and put the entire industry at unnecessary risk.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The guidance for specific diseases will be clear and  unambiguous and will set standards with which everyone will be able to comply.  When that guidance is drawn up, a copy will be issued to every herd-keeper in  the North of Ireland. Once it has been issued, my officials will be on hand to  offer the necessary support and advice.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 8 provides that it will not be an offence, in  itself, to fail to comply with the guidance; however, evidence of failure will  be admissible in court proceedings for an offence under the Diseases of Animals  Order 1981. The clause also enables consideration to be given to the  withholding of all or part of compensation when there is a link between disease  outbreak and the need to slaughter animals as well as non-compliance with the  statutory guidance for that particular disease.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 5 gives effect to an agreement that I made  during the Committee Stage of the Bill to remove the compensation link. I  advise the Agriculture and Rural Development Committee that, although I  recognised and accepted their legitimate concerns about the compensation link,  I made it clear that I would return to that issue in future legislation if a  particular disease situation warrants it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In light of information that I subsequently received from  my veterinary advisers about brucellosis, I entered into discussions with the  Committee about the steps needed to eradicate that costly disease. It is  significant that this is one of the few places left in Europe,  and the only part of these islands, where brucellosis is still present. We have  made good progress over the past couple of years to reduce disease levels, and  there is now a real possibility of pushing for brucellosis freedom for the  North of Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As brucellosis is a highly infectious and clustered  disease, poor biosecurity can be a serious risk to the individual farmer, to  herds around his or hers and to the entire industry. Improving biosecurity will  be essential in pushing toward the eradication of the disease.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A link between serious non-compliance with the most  important elements of the biosecurity guidance and withholding compensation for  the slaughter of diseased animals will provide an important additional tool to  intensify our efforts to push for brucellosis freedom for the North of Ireland.  I am pleased that, after intensive discussions, I have secured the Committee&rsquo;s  agreement to a further amendment, which will make a link between compliance  with new statutory biosecurity guidance on brucellosis and payment of  compensation for the slaughter of animals that are infected with the disease.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 4 will enable an Order to be drawn up to  specify the key areas that will trigger consideration of the partial or whole  withholding of compensation because of serious failure to comply with  biosecurity guidance on brucellosis. My officials will work closely with the  Committee and the industry to draw up the guidance and the Order to specify the  key areas that will trigger consideration. I have already established a  brucellosis working group with officials and industry and veterinary  representatives, and it has been tasked with drawing up the biosecurity  guidance and identifying the key areas that may trigger consideration of a  reduction in compensation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Committee and industry representatives for  their engagement on this important matter. I recognise fully that it is an  extremely difficult issue for everyone. I place on the record that I am not  introducing the amendment as a way to withhold money from conscientious farmers  who, regrettably, have a disease breakdown in their herd. That is not on my  agenda at all. I also make it clear, because there may be some  misunderstanding, that the amendment is not intended to be a means of reducing  compensation costs and delivering efficiency savings. However, a reduction in  the level of disease, whether as a result of there being a greater focus on  biosecurity or any other reason, will help to reduce costs and contribute to  efficiency savings.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In common with all Departments, DARD will be required to  achieve efficiency savings, but that is a totally separate issue from clause 8.  The purpose of amendment No 4 is to encourage and achieve compliance with  biosecurity guidance to reduce, and eventually eradicate, outbreaks of  brucellosis. That will benefit everyone in the livestock industry.  Consideration will only be given to withholding compensation in the most  serious cases, where a herd-keeper&rsquo;s blatant or negligent disregard of  biosecurity guidance has put his or her own herd, surrounding herds or, indeed,  the entire industry at risk.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We must remain focused on the end prize. The actions that I  propose will help us to move more quickly towards eradicating brucellosis and  thereby reducing the costs of controlling the disease, the subsequent burden on  taxpayers and the costs to the industry. William Irwin is not in his place,  but, when I talk about costs, I am referring to the human costs as well as the  financial costs. Anyone who has had an outbreak will recognise the difficulties  that brucellosis causes. Ultimately, if we achieve brucellosis-free status, we  will be able to step down the requirements for annual testing and pre-movement  testing. That is good news, and it will benefit everyone in the agrifood  industry. Amendment No 11 provides that the Order that prescribes the  circumstances in which brucellosis compensation may be reduced shall be subject  to negative resolution in the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I thank the  Minister and her departmental Bill team for being available to the Committee. I  also thank the Committee&rsquo;s staff and members for making the Bill better  legislation than it was when it first came before us. That is the purpose of  Assembly Committees, and our Committee has proved that point.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Opposing evidence on clause 8 was presented to the  Committee. VetNI welcomed the proposed compulsory biosecurity guidance, but the  Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union did not want the  existing voluntary code to be made compulsory. The Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union also indicated its concern about the guidance&rsquo;s  being used as a means of limiting compensation for non-compliance. The  Committee remains opposed to linking compliance with the code to compensation  payments, but, importantly, we welcome the explanation and clarification that  the Minister placed on the record today. Although the Committee expressed its  concerns regarding the move from the voluntary to the compulsory code, it is  assured by the Department that the code will be applied in conjunction with the  industry and that the application of the guidance will be achieved through  subordinate legislation that must be brought before the Committee for its  consideration and approval.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee accepted that the Department wished to have a  deterrent for non-compliance with the guidance in the Bill. However, the  Committee&rsquo;s view was that admissibility of non-compliance in the courts was a  sufficient deterrent and that the link with compensation payments was extreme.  The Department considered the Committee&rsquo;s arguments and agreed to remove the  Bill&rsquo;s link between non-compliance and a reduction in compensation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, the Minister and the Department did a volte-face  in respect of the agreed position late on the Friday before Consideration Stage  was to be moved. The Minister and her senior staff came to the Committee on  Monday 1 June and said that they wished to reintroduce the link as it would  help to eradicate brucellosis. The Committee for Agriculture and Rural  Development congratulates the Department and the industry on their joint  efforts to reduce this disease to its current low levels. We, like them, want this  disease and others to be eradicated in Northern Ireland. However, we want  actions to be taken that are based on substantiated evidence, not upon hearsay.  We want the industry and the Department to work together, as they have been  doing, to eradicate this and other diseases, not the Department taking on  powers that set it up as judge, jury and executioner. The Department does not  need to be in such a position, nor should it want to be.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let us be honest: the reason why non-compliance with the  biosecurity guidance is not an offence is because the burden of proof would be  on the Department, and it is too difficult to prove. The Department  unilaterally deciding that compensation should be reduced or removed would not  have the same burden of proof. In the Committee&rsquo;s view, it was an easy option  that benefited the Department and penalised farmers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It would not have ended there. It would not have stopped  just with brucellosis; it could have been used against diseases such as TB.  Although the Committee noted and accepted the assurances of the Minister and  the Department that the power to reduce compensation was not being introduced  for any reason other than to eradicate brucellosis, we could not and would not  allow such a general, but powerful, power to be introduced without checks and  balances. We took the Department at its word.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At a meeting in Enniskillen with the Minister and her  senior officials, I put forward the suggestion that the Department specify  brucellosis in the Bill. The Department resisted that suggestion and responded  by restating that the subordinate legislation would be specific to brucellosis  and that that would continue to be scrutinised and approved by the Committee.  However, that would leave the power to reduce compensation in other  circumstances in the primary legislation and would not allay the fears that the  Committee, and, most important, the industry, had voiced.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In order to support the eradication of brucellosis, while  at the same time addressing the concerns that were expressed about this matter  by members, the Committee sought legal advice about whether the clause could be  amended to include a specific reference to brucellosis. The substance of the  advice was that there was no legal impediment to specifying brucellosis in the  clause. Having considered that advice, the Committee recommended, on 8  September, that the Department should specifically refer to brucellosis in the  clause. That was further emphasised by the Deputy Chairman of the Committee and  me at a meeting with the permanent secretary and senior officials on 14  September. The Minister attended our meeting on 15 September and advised that  the Depart&shy;ment would happily accept our recommendation to specify brucellosis  in clause 8. I welcome that agreement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee remains concerned that the Department&rsquo;s  priority in this matter has changed, particularly as reductions in compensation  payments for brucellosis-infected animals where there is evidence of poor  biosecurity has appeared in the departmental efficiency delivery plans. The Committee  assures the House and farm businesses that it will continue to scrutinise those  plans to ensure than any efficiencies that are achieved are the result of a  successful pursuance of the eradication of brucellosis, and not a targeted  attack on farm biosecurity to save money. That would be a travesty.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee&rsquo;s priority in negotiating amendment No 4 was  to eradicate brucellosis while protecting the industry. The Committee will  require regular updates from the Department on progress against that priority,  and it looks forward earnestly to the industry being brucellosis-free in a  couple of years&rsquo; time. The Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development,  therefore, supports the second group of amendments.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. In supporting amendment Nos 4, 5 and  11, I reiterate that the vast majority of farmers have very high standards of  biosecurity. The Bill is not about burdening those farmers; it targets farmers  who jeopardise our whole industry. That cannot be allowed to continue,  particularly given the need to eradicate brucellosis.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The guidance will be disease-specific. It will provide  farmers with the clear, precise advice that they need to prevent disease. There  is a constant need to develop relationships between farmers and the Department,  and there are concerns about how the Department carried out raids in response  to disease outbreaks in the past, as has already been touched on. In my  opinion, the guidance will robustly defend farmers&rsquo; rights. I ask the Department  to include lessons learned from the past in the biosecurity guidance and to  train officials, particularly those who will be involved in investigations and  raids.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the guidance that will be provided to every herd  holder. Will the Minister clarify whether officers will be allowed as much time  as needed to explain the guidance and to offer support? As my colleague Francie  Molloy said, we need a pragmatic approach, because sometimes these things can  be bureaucratic, and farmers fail to understand it. We need that support and  guidance, because the last thing that we want to do is create fear in the  farming community. Will the guidance also be placed on the DARD website?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister was advised by her officials that the  tightening up of biosecurity provided the North with a good opportunity to  eradicate brucellosis, hence making Ireland brucellosis-free.  Brucellosis is very infectious, and good biosecurity is essential to  controlling it. Poor biosecurity jeopardises neighbouring farms and poses a significant  risk to our whole farming industry. Furthermore, the disease imposes a cost on  all taxpayers. Brucellosis is not just a rural issue; it is everyone&rsquo;s, because  large sums of money are paid in compensation. We must end that by eradicating  brucellosis, and the guidance will provide us with another tool to achieve that  aim.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 5 has already been outlined. It deals with  withholding all or part of the compensation, depending on how seriously the  guidance has been breached. What safeguards have been put in place to ensure  that ordinary farmers who have a breakdown will not be unfairly penalised? Will  new training be given to the officials who investigate breaches in biosecurity  guidelines? Go raibh maith agat.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Before I call Mr Ford, I remind the House that Question Time for the Minister  for Social Development is at 3.00 pm, so I may have to interrupt the Member and  allow him to finish his speech after Question Time.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Speaker. I take the hint. I trust that an interruption will not  be necessary.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I first declare my interest or, technically, that of my  wife in a family farm. As one who did not speak in the first part of the  debate, I think that this section corresponds with what I heard earlier. The  Minister has listened to the views of the industry. The Committee has reflected  those views and engaged in discussions that were, perhaps, robust, but that may  have been the kind of discussion that was required. We probably have a good  Bill now, and I shall support the three amendments in group 2.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although there was a hint that it might be necessary to  look further afield, I welcome the fact that the Minister specified that the  amendments, at this stage, cover brucellosis as a single disease. That is the  right thing to do, given that outbreaks of that disease have been decreasing  for a considerable time. We hope that we are approaching its eradication, but  as the Minister said, this is the only region in these islands in which the  disease has not been eradicated. Therefore, in the light of the seriousness of  brucellosis and the problems that it has created over the years for many decent  farmers, any suggestion that some people should not comply with the guidance  and be treated differently from those who are honest victims of a breakout is  not right. The vast majority of farmers seek to comply as best they can with  biosecurity, and they must not be subjected to the potentially disastrous  actions of a small minority.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On a couple of occasions, the Minister referred to what she  described as &ldquo;serious non-compliance&rdquo; with the biosecurity guidance. Indeed,  she went further when she later referred to &ldquo;blatant or negligent disregard&rdquo;.  Given that she has been able to inform the House about the timetable for the  guidance&rsquo;s publication and that it has largely been agreed informally, it would  be important if she could give us more information about how she will consider  the prescription of those circumstances that the proposed amendments cover.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are clearly concerns, which Willie Clarke expressed,  about how ordinary farmers might suffer. Therefore, in the same way that the  guidance was consulted on in advance, there is a need for the Minister to  detail the prescription of those circumstances. As she makes her winding-up  speech for this part of the debate, I trust that she will give us some  information. In the coming months, as that protocol develops, perhaps she will  ensure that the Department continues to inform farmers so that they are fully  aware of what is proposed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The debate stood suspended.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenAnswersHeading"><a name="6"></a>Oral Answers to Questions</p>
    <p class="H3SectionHeading">Social Development</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Question 1 has been withdrawn.</p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading">Shared Future: Public Meetings</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Dr  McDonnell </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development to provide an update on  her recent public meetings on &lsquo;A Shared Future&rsquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 392/10<a name="AQO392/10" id="AQO392/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development (Ms Ritchie)</strong>: Working towards a shared future has been  at the forefront of my agenda since I became Minister for Social Development.  Our divided society deepens poverty as well as prejudice. Therefore, I have  begun work in my Department to tackle that division. For example, I have taken  steps to ensure that shared housing is at the heart of my newbuild social  programme and other programmes within existing estates and communities. I have  also ensured that my urban regeneration master plans and public realm schemes  have the core objective to make public space attractive for people to relax in  and to live together in peace.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, those developments alone are not enough. The  successful achievement of the vision for a shared future, based on equality and  mutual respect, requires actions not only to tackle the scourge of sectarianism  but to challenge and address division and separation on other grounds, such as  disability, race or culture. It requires strong political leadership and agreed  policy and programme action by government. It must be a priority for all of us,  if we are not to jeopardise all the progress of the past 15 years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important, therefore, to develop a broader strategic  approach to this important issue and over the past three months or so, I have  held public meetings in Ballymena, Newry, Bangor, Enniskillen, Omagh, Belfast,  Craigavon, Downpatrick, Derry, Lisburn, Strabane and Cookstown. Their primary  purpose was to listen to what people have to say about a shared future and to  hear their suggestions for possible ways forward. The meetings have been  attended by more than 1,000 people, reflecting an appetite and a strong desire  to take forward the shared future agenda. A wide range of opinion was  expressed, covering areas such as political leadership, poverty and inequality,  housing, planning, flags and emblems, public service delivery, the voluntary  and community sector, education and employment. I intend to develop proposals  based on, among other things, the ideas and suggestions generated at those  meetings, and I will bring my findings and proposals to Executive colleagues  early next year.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her answer. Can she suggest in what areas further  progress can be made on the shared future agenda? For instance, are there any  specific ideas to tackle the naked sectarianism that exists in some pockets of  our communities?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I am well aware of the importance of the Member&rsquo;s  question and the issue of naked sectarianism. People live in divided  communities, in spite of the fact that 80% of the people in Northern Ireland  have indicted that they want to live together rather than apart.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In my Department, the shared future agenda can be best  addressed through housing, urban regeneration and community development. In  particular, my Department can support shared housing initiatives, such as the  Shared Neighbourhood programme, and develop the housing selection scheme to  provide those who want to live in mixed neighbourhoods the opportunity to do  so. In regeneration and community development, my Department can support those  voluntary and community groups that promote the vision of &lsquo;A Shared Future&rsquo; and  actively work towards ending sectarianism and division. We will continue to  plan and develop our city and town centres in ways that ensure that all the  community has access to them as shared spaces for work and leisure.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, as was demonstrated at our public meetings, there  are other policy areas, such as education, planning and employment, in which a  shared future agenda could be progressed. Those areas cut across the  responsibilities of a number of Departments and highlight the fact that we can  only move forward if an agreed policy and programme of action is undertaken by  government as a whole.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. With regard to the recent public meeting  in Newry, can the Minister confirm that the issues raised by two families from Armagh have been dealt with?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I am aware that the two issues are being addressed. I  have written to Mr and Mrs McClelland with a satisfactory resolution, and I  will look at the other issue and come back to the Member.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that the money that has been spent so far in developing  a shared future strategy has been wasted, as we have not had the benefit of  such a strategy? Will the Minister inform the House of what discussions have  taken place in the Executive regarding the costs of developing the strategy? Is  she in a position to inform the House of what those costs are?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: The document that was being prepared by the First  Minister and deputy First Minister has not been brought to the Executive for  consideration, debate or agreement. A few Executive meetings ago, I offered to  prepare a paper on how to develop a normal and shared society. That paper would  be based on expertise that has been gained through research. The deputy First  Minister said that he and the First Minister would reflect on it. I returned to  the issue at the next Executive meeting, and they are still reflecting on it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Suffice it to say, we have to develop policies and  programmes that encourage and promote a normal society, because I am of the  firm opinion that people want to live together, rather than to live apart. That  is the impression that I have got from meetings that I have attended. Separate  but equal is no substitute for a shared future, and it is simply not good  enough.</p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading">Local Government: Social Deprivation</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr A  Maskey </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development if she can provide an  assurance that the budget transferred with neighbourhood renewal functions to  local government as part of the review of public administration will be  sufficient to allow councils to tackle social deprivation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 393/10<a name="AQO393/10" id="AQO393/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I have given such an assurance already, but I will  repeat it. Local government will receive the full resources that are associated  with the operational delivery of neighbourhood renewal. That will happen when  that function transfers from my Department, and will include the available  programme and staffing resources.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Tackling social deprivation is the responsibility of all  Departments, not only the Department for Social Development (DSD). It is an  issue that concerns every Department, and every Department is required to do  its bit. Neighbourhood renewal is the Executive&rsquo;s main programme for tackling  social deprivation in our most disadvantaged areas, and, as such, it requires  the support of all Departments. The neighbourhood renewal implementation fund  makes an important contribution to tackling deprivation, but it is not  sufficient by itself.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I can stand by my record as Minister and by the contribution  that I have made in addressing disadvantage in our most deprived areas. In the  current comprehensive spending review (CSR) period, I have allocated &pound;60  million revenue funding for neighbourhood renewal areas, and I will be doing  all that I can to secure resources in the next comprehensive spending review to  enable councils to continue that important work. However, I am concerned about  the financial outlook, and I hope that other Departments will do likewise to  secure resources.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her response. I accept that the Executive have overall  responsibility for the area, but, given the bailiwick of the Minister&rsquo;s  Department, can she provide further information or detail about what training  or oversight her Department may give when the function is transferred?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Those issues are under consideration. I accept that  there is a clear need for training, because the civil servants, who will be  going with the functions and the budgets, have an expertise in this area. No  doubt they will be able to deploy such expertise to whatever councils they are  employed in. Suffice it to say, local government is the best place for neighbourhood  renewal, because it is about locally based regeneration. Who better to deliver  that than councils and councillors?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her response. As a result of the review of public  administration (RPA), it is obvious that some areas will experience greater  social deprivation than others. The Minister will be aware that my area will be  among those of greater social deprivation. Money has been allocated to those  areas, but some has been taken away. Can the Minister ensure that the money  goes to the areas in which it is needed, rather than to other areas where the  need is not so great?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Mr Shannon is referring to the Small Pockets of  Deprivation (SPOD) programme and the Areas at Risk programme, with particular  reference to Newtownards and Bowtown. Funding for the SPOD programme will  continue until the end of March 2010, and funding of &pound;640,000 has been  allocated for the current financial year. An independent evaluation report of  the first three years of that programme, up to March 2009, has been received by  my Department and is under consideration. Having visited some of those  programmes, I am well aware of the impact that they have in minimising  deprivation and in getting people involved in the development of programmes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will be making the decision on the future of the SPOD  programme before the end of 2009, with particular reference to the Areas at  Risk programme. That pilot programme has allowed my Department to respond to  emerging difficulties and deprivation that is outside the remit of the  established programmes. That programme will also be formally evaluated later  this year and, because of its temporary nature, it is not appropriate to  include it in the list of departmental functions. However, I will consider the  evaluations of both programmes to decide on the way forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Shannon has raised this issue with me in various  questions for written answer, and in other items of correspondence, and I will  respond to him.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>:  If the Minister were to gaze into a crystal ball, what would she see as the  greatest challenge facing her Department in transferring functions to local  government?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Mr Dallat has presented a challenge to me.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One of the greatest challenges to my Department in transferring  functions is the uncertainty over the overall Budget. However, there is another  political issue to be faced, namely the uncertainty over the legislation, which  is still with the centre, and on which no decision has been made. The problem  with RPA is like so many other matters: the parties at the centre, the DUP and  Sinn F&eacute;in, seem incapable of getting anything over the line.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>:  Will the Minister outline what her Department&rsquo;s role will be in neighbourhood  renewal after RPA has been completed?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: The Department&rsquo;s role will be at a strategic policy  level; it will make the policy and form the strategies. The local councils will  be the operational arm; they will deal with the delivery.</p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading">Warm Homes Scheme: Fuel Poverty</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Rev Dr  Robert Coulter </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development for her assessment  of the effectiveness of the warm homes strategy in tackling fuel poverty. (AQO 394/10<a name="AQO394/10" id="AQO394/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Fuel poverty is affected by three factors: household  energy efficiency, energy prices and household incomes. To date, improving  energy efficiency has been at the heart of the Government&rsquo;s fuel poverty  strategy in Northern Ireland.  Energy efficiency in the context of fuel poverty has two elements: household  behaviour in energy consumption, and the energy performance of homes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although energy efficiency improvements delivered by my  Department&rsquo;s warm homes scheme have made a significant contribution to  alleviating fuel poverty, the rises in energy prices in 2008 placed more  households in fuel poverty. Increases in energy prices have been the largest  factor in the rise in fuel poverty numbers in recent years. The extent of  rising prices has also made it particularly difficult for those on the lowest  incomes to meet their household bills. Notwithstanding those challenges, the  warm homes scheme has been hugely popular and very successful since its  introduction in 2001. More than &pound;118 million has been spent making in excess of  71,000 homes warmer. The warm homes scheme has been hugely successful and has  helped many people. However, fuel poverty has become an increasingly hard nut  to crack. If we have an ambition to eliminate it, more must be done.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My officials have commenced a review of the Ending Fuel  Poverty strategy that was launched by the Department in 2004, and I expect a  public consultation document to be issued early in the new year for wider discussion  about how to tackle fuel poverty in the future.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert  Coulter</strong>: I thank the Minister for her answer. What impact has the change in  the eligibility criteria for the scheme had on uptake and on tackling fuel  poverty across all sections of society?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: It is still very early to undertake an evaluation of  the new system or to give the Member an accurate assessment. That will be done  after a year of the scheme&rsquo;s implementation. At this stage, however, there has  been a healthy uptake and interest in the scheme, and its purpose is to focus  on those who are most in need, namely people in receipt of low income. We  wanted to address need. The Member will, therefore, be aware of the Public  Accounts Committee report on the warm homes scheme, and the Department for  Social Development&rsquo;s response, which was to widen the remit for eligibility.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr W McCrea</strong>:  As we face the long, dark winter months, I am sure that the Minister will agree  that fuel poverty is still a sad reality in Northern Ireland, and that many are  fearful as they face the winter and what it might hold for them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although I welcome the thrust of the warm homes strategy,  how is it progressing in my South Antrim  constituency? Will the Minister commend groups such as the one that meets in  the Antrim Borough Council offices for their efforts to place fuel poverty at  the top of the local agenda?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I am confident that the warm homes scheme, under its  new guise, continues to address fuel poverty. I am particularly conscious of a  report on energy prices, which was issued this morning. I recognise that there  is a problem, and any increases in energy prices should be justified. However,  that is, primarily, a matter for the energy regulator and the Department of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am aware of the work that Antrim Borough Council has been  doing because the Member and my colleague Mr Burns alerted me to the work of  that group. I believe that I have met the group, and I am due to meet it again  in the not-too-distant future, when I will hear more about that project and how  it has effectively targeted fuel poverty in that area. I encourage the Member,  Mr Burns and the other members of Antrim Borough Council in that difficult  task, because the Department is always seeking wider partners to help to address  need where it is most acute, including fuel poverty. The bottom line is that we  want to keep people warm this winter.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  What percentage of applicants have been refused assistance as a result of the  change in the eligibility criteria of the warm homes scheme?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: The Department, through the two scheme managers, is  undertaking work on various assessments that were carried over from Egan. It is  not possible at this stage to conclude from that work and the new applications  how many applicants were approved, are awaiting consideration or were refused.  We hope to complete that work by the end of the month, when I will be happy to  write to the Member.</p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading">Housing Budget</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr Burns </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development what steps she is taking to  ensure optimal use of the housing budget.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  395/10<a name="AQO395/10" id="AQO395/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: As the housing budget has been decimated by the  collapse in capital receipts, it is even more important to make the best use of  the budget that is left. When I launched the new housing agenda in February  2008, I made it clear that officials would seek to bring forward greater levels  of private finance to complement the resources already committed from the  public purse. Officials are continuing to explore a number of innovative  options to fund the housing agenda, some of which have been successfully  implemented.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I commissioned Savills to undertake a stock condition  survey to determine the ongoing investment required for the Northern Ireland  Housing Executive&rsquo;s stock. That survey will assist the Housing Executive and  officials in the Department&rsquo;s housing division to target the limited resources  that have been allocated to where they are most needed. The subsidy to housing  associations has been reduced by approximately 10%, in effect requiring them to  contribute even greater levels of private finance in the delivery of new social  homes, which will make our money go further.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The grant funding of &pound;15 million that the Depart&shy;ment  provided to the Northern Ireland Co-ownership Housing Association has, for the  first time, enabled it to attract its own significant private investment of &pound;48  million to deliver affordable housing, and the Ulster Bank has agreed to work  with the Co-ownership Housing Association in making mortgages without deposits  available to applicants. Officials in DSD are working closely with the Housing  Executive to develop the social housing development programme to build,  increasingly, on land already in public ownership, which will reduce the  land-cost element of the newbuild programme and allow us to build more homes  with the same amount of money.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have been extremely innovative financially in the  purchase of ex-military houses, particularly at Pond Park  in Lisburn, where we have achieved tremendous value for the taxpayer. In  addition, my officials continue to work closely with the Strategic Investment  Board to identify new opportunities to complement the delivery of the programme.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>:  Will the Minister explain what innovations she has introduced in the area of  housing policy and delivery?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: When I launched the new housing agenda, I made it clear  that I was introducing a radical and energetic agenda for housing that had not  been seen for a generation. That has included the creation of more shared  future housing; the launch of our shared neighbourhood programme; bringing back  into use former military housing; developing a new procurement strategy to  deliver more efficiently than ever before; and more private finance from the  European Investment Bank.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have delivered 1,750 new homes this year, which is our  biggest number for a decade. I could also highlight our more energy-efficient  and better-quality housing that will complement our wider work in alleviating  fuel poverty, in that all new houses built since April 2008 must confirm to  code level 4 for sustainability.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We also have some exciting plans for getting major  refurbishments done at little cost to the taxpayer, and we are innovating daily  to squeeze the maximum possible outputs from our greatly reduced budgets.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  In view of the Minister&rsquo;s stretched and restricted budget, will she offer any  consolation to the many people, particularly those who are disabled, who are  waiting for extensions of any sort, including minor extensions, to their  properties?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Mr McCarthy knows full well about that issue, as he has  written to me and asked me questions about in the Assembly. Internal  adaptations to an existing property will be done automatically. Extensions fall  into a different category.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I go back to the principal issue of the housing budget.  Unlike other Departments, DSD&rsquo;s budget is predicated on income from land sales  and house sales. As a result of the economic downturn, much of that  disappeared. Therefore, I was left with an &pound;80 million shortfall last year, a  &pound;100 million shortfall this year, and a &pound;100 million shortfall for next year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that the Member will agree that there is an onus  on every Member to get housing on a sound financial footing, and Mr McCarthy  and his party have supported me in that. However, we need to continue with  that. I will continue to bid in future monitoring rounds for money for  adaptations for the homes of disabled people, because there is a need to  address that situation. Suffice it to say that I need the support of all my  ministerial colleagues to put housing on a sound financial footing and to look  at all the innovative ways of financing housing, because a house is the most  fundamental thing to anybody, no matter what guise it may take.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that the Hospital    Lane area of Limavady in my constituency, which  she visited last year, should be a priority for house repair to optimise home  provision in the Limavady area?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: As the Member will appreciate, I receive many requests  for prioritisation of planned maintenance schemes. I am happy to consider that  area, in conjunction with the Housing Executive. I recall my visit to that  estate, when, with the Member, I met some residents. I will look at that and  come back to the Member. I ask him to ask the Minister of Finance and  Personnel, who, I understand, is his party colleague, with all his other party  ministerial colleagues, to ensure that housing is put on a sound financial  footing once and for all and that we make that major change between the  situation under the direct rule Administration and under devolution.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  The Minister has given us a full resume of her budget. How hopeful is she of  any additional funding from the Minister of Finance and Personnel in the  December monitoring round? Will that have any impact on the social housing  scheme in Monkstown in my East Antrim  constituency?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Mr Robinson asked me about Monkstown during my previous  Question Time, and I gave him an assurance that we will be happy to examine it.  He is asking me to do what Mr Dallat asked me to do: look into my crystal ball.  I am afraid that I am not in my tent today, but I can say that I need the  support of everybody, including all my ministerial colleagues.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Mystic Margaret. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I need their support to put housing on a sound  financial footing. I can rely on certain ministerial colleagues for that, and I  hope that I can rely on the remainder to ensure that that happens. Some housing  issues, whether relating to planned maintenance, capital improvements, grants,  newbuild schemes, warm homes or supported housing, are, with health and  education, the most fundamental requirements to all our daily lives.</p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading">Social Housing: Rent Arrears</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">6. <strong>Miss  McIlveen </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development what action she intends  to take to address the growing problem of rent arrears in the social housing  sector. (AQO 396/10<a name="AQO396/10" id="AQO396/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: As the Member knows, a Public Accounts Committee report  on the management of social housing rent collection and arrears was issued some  weeks ago, and a detailed memorandum of reply is being prepared that will set  out the considered response to the issues that were raised in the report.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I must gently correct the Member: although the level of  rent arrears is a significant challenge, it has been coming down in recent  years. I will outline those areas in which it has been coming down, which I  hope that Members will find helpful: overall debt levels, write-off levels and  the number of large debts continue to fall.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Only yesterday, I met the chief executive of the Housing  Executive and some of his senior officials to impress on him that I want  further evidence of that reduction. That is important, notwithstanding the fact  that many people in the social housing sector face enormous difficulties with  rents. I appreciate that some of those people are on housing benefit. People  find themselves in arrears because of requirements on their limited income. I  ask that people be a little sensitive on the issue. The present economic  downturn makes for a challenging environment for rent arrears. I am sure that  the Member will not disagree with that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  I note the Minister&rsquo;s response. However, she will be aware that one criticism  of the Public Accounts Committee report is that targets could be subject to  manipulation. In fact, in one year, the target was reached only by writing off  a substantial amount of the debt. Will the Minister ensure that, in future,  targets are robust and respected?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I do not accept the assertion that targets are  manipulated. In the past financial year, the Northern Ireland Housing Executive  collected 97% of the rent due, and that was in a recession. All Members should  welcome that.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  On a point of order, a Cheann Comhairle. As a member of the Business Committee,  I have concerns that any time that a motion on health is put forward for debate  the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety is not available. Can  the Ceann Comhairle use his influence on that matter? The Health Department  receives half the Budget, yet the Minister has not been available recently.  That is not fair to people who want us to represent their views.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have to say that &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Further to that point of order &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Allow me to answer the point of order. The matter has been raised with the  Business Committee, and that Committee&rsquo;s business should not be discussed on  the Floor of the House. However, I take the Member&rsquo;s point. It is a matter for  the Executive, but it is also a matter for me as Speaker. I have tried to  address it in the past, and I hope to be able to address it in the future.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Further to that point of order, Mr Speaker, all Members will be aware of the  considerable pressure that the Minister of Health finds himself under in  dealing with the issue of swine flu. Some consideration ought to be given to  that when Members make such statements.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Those are not really points of order, and, as usual, I have been generous in  taking them. Members should be careful not to raise points of order that are  not really points of order. I hear what the Members have said, but it is for  the Executive to address the issue.</p>

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>: I  return to the second group of amendments, amendment Nos 4, 5 and 11. I support  those amendments, based on what is required, particularly the eradication of  brucellosis.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the commitment from the Minister and the  Department to the specific issue of brucellosis, which is mentioned in  amendment No 4. We must recognise the importance of eradicating brucellosis and  the effect that that would have on the farming community, which is subjected to  livestock tests at least yearly and to the closure of herds around the country  because of their infection by brucellosis. The eradication of brucellosis would  be an important step forward. As I said before, the Department&rsquo;s interpretation  and implementation of the legislation to do that is important.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Training, correspondence and consultation on biosecurity  would be important and of benefit to the farming community and the Department.  Depart&shy;mental officials and vets regularly use the word &ldquo;biosecurity&rdquo;, and they  know exactly what it means. However, the farming and rural community has  different interpretations of it, and more definition is needed. The  correspondence to farmers will contain an explanation, but more must be done  with training and with advertisements in the press, on television and in  farming journals on what biosecurity means, how people can enhance it and how  they can take precautions to prevent disease from spreading accidentally.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that the issue of removing compensation for  those who deliberately cause infection be dealt with. The full force of the law  must be used to stop the practice of deliberate infection. The view exists that  that is one reason why brucellosis continues to infect cattle here when the  disease has been eradicated in other countries. If the North were to achieve  eradication, in line with the Twenty-six Counties, which is free of brucellosis,  the island would be clear of the disease. That is an important challenge to be  met.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One way in which to try to deal with brucellosis and to  ensure that eradication happens quickly is through training and correspondence.  Good co-operation on the issue should be encouraged through having departmental  officials and vets hold meetings with the farming community, trade unions and  others throughout the countryside. The Department must try to talk farmers through  the process and advise them on how eradication can best be achieved and how  they can take precautions to ensure that the disease is not spread  accidentally.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, as we deal with those issues, it is important  that this legislation be recognised for the benefits that it will bring. It is  to be hoped that the resulting legislation will be better than that which was  originally proposed. Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>:  As the Committee report states, opposing evidence was presented on biosecurity.  That should be noted. Amendment No 4 provides adequate clarification on a point  that the Committee raised. Amendment No 5 removes reference to the Diseases of  Animals (Northern Ireland)  Order 1981, which will be amended by the Bill if it is passed. I welcome the  fact that the Department has listened to the Committee&rsquo;s views on biosecurity  guidance and compliance and that it has removed the Bill&rsquo;s link between  non-compliance and a reduction in compensation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Farmers have had to spend a substantial amount of money on  their farms so that they meet current requirements. The last thing that any  farmer wants is disease on his farm. That is true right across the board,  albeit with, possibly, one or two exceptions: I am sure that the Minister  understands what I mean by that. I welcome the fact that the Minister wants to  modernise the legislation and bring it into the twenty-first century. In order  to move forward, that legislation is needed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Most importantly, the message from farmers is that we want  to work with the Department and that we will do everything in our power to  eliminate disease.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.  Again, I want to acknowledge the volume of work that has been done on this part  of the Bill. The Chairman of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural  Development explained the timeline. I was exhausted just listening to him. We  can often forget the time and effort that goes into such matters. It is good to  be reminded that much deliberation and discussion was had on the Bill, and the  result is a good piece of legislation. I thank Committee members for the time,  patience and effort that they put into scrutinising the Bill, together with the  Department and me.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Prevention of disease through the practice of good  biosecurity is an essential component of promoting a competitive industry,  protecting animal and public health and safeguarding everyone&rsquo;s interests.  Depending on the disease&rsquo;s circumstances, it might be appropriate for  biosecurity guidance to be voluntary or statutory or for statutory biosecurity  guidance to be linked to compensation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I consider statutory biosecurity guidance and making a link  to compensation to be an important additional tool with which to push towards  the eradication of brucellosis. It is the right thing to do. We have almost  eradicated the disease, but we must step up efforts to achieve full eradication  as early as possible.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The current code is voluntary. Farmers whose biosecurity  practices are not up to standard put at risk the responsible majority and the  wider rural community. Clearly, it is unfair to responsible herd-keepers who  maintain a high level of biosecurity that measures are not in place to  acknowledge their efforts and to protect their holdings by placing penalties on  farmers who do not maintain appropriate biosecurity standards. Responsible  farmers will benefit from the higher standards and lower risk of disease that  the proposed arrangements would encourage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I was asked about amendment No 4 to clause 8. The amendment  to clause 8 was proposed after detailed discussions with the Committee for  Agriculture and Rural Development. It was agreed that, although the power to  draw up statutory biosecurity guidance for all diseases should exist, the power  to link biosecurity guidance to the withholding of compensation should be  limited to brucellosis. Again, I appreciate the efforts of the Chairperson and  the Deputy Chairperson of the Committee on that matter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Given the nature of brucellosis, the focus on it and the  link to compensation are key elements in helping to promote better biosecurity  in the push towards achieving brucellosis-free status. That would bring us into  line with the South of Ireland, which has been officially recognised as being  brucellosis-free, and with Britain.  The latest statistics to the end of September 2009 demonstrate that the  incidence of brucellosis has decreased here by more than 60% since September  2008. That is extremely encouraging, and we hope to continue to build on that  reduction. I reiterate that clause 8 is not designed as a means to reduce  compensation costs; rather, it is designed as a tool to promote better  biosecurity and to push towards achieving brucellosis-free status.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A question was asked about how we will enforce biosecurity  guidance on the ground. Currently, veterinary officers visit herds that have  brucellosis and other herds in the immediate vicinity that are considered to be  at high risk. During such visits, any significant breaches of biosecurity will  be noted, and farmers will be advised of the appropriate steps that they need  to take to protect their herds. Those steps will be consistent with the  guidance. I assure the Assembly that officials and vets will be on hand to  provide advice and support on a wide range of biosecurity issues. We want to  work with the industry to ensure that it understands what it needs to do.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the event of a brucellosis outbreak, veterinary officers  will carry out an investigation of the circumstances of the outbreak. If the  investigation identifies that there has been blatant or negligent disregard  that results in a serious breach of the statutory biosecurity guidance,  consideration will be given to withholding compensation for animals that are  slaughtered.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I reiterate that biosecurity will not eradicate disease,  but it is one of a range of important components in the eradication scheme for  brucellosis. &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am very sorry. I thought that my phone was switched off;  it is now.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  I think that we should withhold compensation.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I think that the caller was phoning to  tell me to shut up.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">An improvement in farm biosecurity across the North and, in  particular, in brucellosis risk areas will undoubtedly make a major  contribution to our attempt to eradicate the disease. That is a globally  acknowledged fact. If people follow biosecurity guidance, that will certainly  greatly reduce the risk of acquiring brucellosis. Additional elements in our  efforts will significantly increase our chances of success in the eradication  of brucellosis from the North.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The present brucellosis-free status of the South and the  encouraging recent downward trend in the North provide us with the opportunity  to press forward on the eradication of the disease. I do not want the  negligence or irresponsibility of a few people to put all the industry at risk  and undo much good work.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Willie Clarke asked who would be involved in the  consideration of the biosecurity guidance. It is important to say that we want  consensus on the guidance. It has been drawn up, and it will be supported not  only by the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development but the Ulster  Farmers&rsquo; Union, NIAPA, the National Beef  Association and private veterinary representatives. It is important to have  that scope of support for the biosecurity guidance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Willie also asked about safeguards for conscientious  farmers. My proposal seeks a change in mindset to secure recognition by all  farmers that there are practical steps that they can take to minimise disease  risk on their farms. Many herdkeepers already apply the procedures that are  laid down in the voluntary code. We are not seeking to apply the deterrent of  withholding compensation widely, but a small minority of irresponsible farmers  is prepared to put others at risk. It is, therefore, aimed at farmers who are  prepared, through negligent or blatant disregard of the code, to put their  neighbours&rsquo; livelihoods at risk. The proposal to withhold compensation focuses  on that. In fact, if we never had to use it, I would be a happy woman, because  it would mean that the provisions in the Bill are a deterrent to farmers who  would enable their herds or those of their neighbours to acquire brucellosis.  In that way, the Bill alone will help.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">David Ford asked how &ldquo;blatant or negligent disregard&rdquo; will  be interpreted in practice. First, I wish to say that I appreciate Mr Ford&rsquo;s  interest. We have discussed that matter, and, although he is not a member of  the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development, he is committed to  addressing issues of that nature. Therefore, I will ensure that he receives a  copy of the guidance and is kept up to date.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The reasonable and practical measures that a herdkeeper can  and should take will be defined in the biosecurity guidance that will be drawn  up in partnership with the stakeholders whom I mentioned. In fact, we are  already working on that guidance in partnership with the brucellosis  stakeholder working group. The accompanying subordinate Order will specify the  key areas of biosecurity that will trigger a reduction in or the withholding of  compensation. The steps that herdkeepers should take will be communicated to  them through specific veterinary advice and the guidance. If a herdkeeper shows  a blatant or negligent disregard for those key areas of biosecurity,  consideration will be given to reducing or withholding compensation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I reinforce the point that the phrase &ldquo;blatant or negligent  disregard&rdquo; is intended to convey that withholding compensation will be  considered only in the most serious and extreme cases, as the circumstances  proscribed in the Order will reflect. Breaches of biosecurity include not  disposing of foetuses and afterbirth properly, because there is evidence that  that contributes greatly to the spread of diseases; sharing a bull among farms;  sharing equipment and feed in a high-risk area; spreading slurry from other  farms, because that can also increase the risk of disease; not isolating  pregnant purchased female cattle until after calving, which may spread disease;  and mixing herds that DARD understands to be separate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Biosecurity advice will be categorised to reflect general  good practice, and additional advice will be applicable to at-risk and  restricted herds. Farmers will need to take cognisance of the situation at  different stages.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Francie Molloy asked what my Department does to encourage  greater biosecurity on farms. My Department has a long-term commitment to  promoting biosecurity messages in a timely manner and in response to the  heightened risk of disease. That promotion takes the form of leaflets,  advertising, press releases, posters, updates on the DARD website and meetings  with farmers and private veterinary practitioners. I reiterate the point that  my Department works in partnership with others to address the risks.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Other initiatives include courses at Greenmount that  contain instruction on biosecurity for the next generation of farmers. A  biosecurity module is also included in the lifelong learning programme for  farmers. The Committee and Members are keen to encourage new blood into the  industry, and we want to give those farmers the skills to farm in a profitable  and sustainable way.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The focus farm scheme, which is funded under the rural  development programme, promotes good practice and provides biosecurity  training. Each focus farm is required to prepare a biosecurity plan to protect  stock, and that information is cascaded to farmers who take part in the scheme.  Focus farmers provide protective clothing and footwear, as well as disinfectant  dips for cars and footwear.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Biosecurity also includes the prudent sourcing of stock and  associated on-farm quarantine. I have repeatedly stressed that message and urged  the farming community to enforce a voluntary ban on the import of animals from  bluetongue-affected areas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that my statement gives some flavour of the steps  that we are taking to improve biosecurity and that it helps farmers to  understand what they are required to do. We must all work together to improve  the health of herds, our appeal to export markets and the viability of farming  in the North of Ireland.</p>

    <p class="B3BodyTextClause">Clause 11 (Deliberate infection)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  We now come to the third group of amendments for debate. With amendment No 6,  it will be convenient to debate amendment Nos 7, 8 and 9. The amendments deal  with increasing penalties for a second offence of deliberate infection and  related issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members should note that amendment Nos 7 and 8 are  consequential to amendment No 6. Therefore, if amendment No 6 is not made, I  will not proceed to call amendment Nos 7 and 8.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I beg to move amendment No 6: In page 9,  line 36, at end insert</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;( ) If a person is convicted of an offence under  Article 5A and, at any time after the date of that conviction, that person is  convicted of a further offence under that Article, the court shall by order  disqualify that person, for such period as it thinks fit, from keeping or  dealing in&mdash;</p>

    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 6 will insert a new penalty provision into  clause 11. There has been widespread support for clause 11, which makes it an  offence to infect an animal with disease deliberately. As I said at Second  Stage, that vile act affects the welfare of the animal and causes the spread of  disease, and I will not tolerate it. The purpose of deliberately infecting an  animal is to gain compensation for diseased animals that have to be  slaughtered. Therefore, there is clearly an element of fraud involved.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am thankful that there is no evidence to suggest that  deliberate infection is a widespread practice. However, DARD must operate a  zero tolerance policy and deal decisively with anyone who engages in that  practice. The penalties for such an offence are imprisonment for up to two  years, an unlimited fine or both. In addition, the court may order that the person  be disqualified from keeping animals for a specified period. During the  scrutiny of the Bill, the Committee asked me to consider stronger penalties for  repeat offenders. I endorse the Committee&rsquo;s view that repeat offenders must be  dealt with vigorously.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The issue of fines and penalties is a reserved matter. I  consulted the Minister of State at the NIO, and I am pleased to say that he  supports the introduction of stronger penalties for repeat offenders.  Therefore, I propose amendment No 6, which, in the case of a second or  subsequent offence of deliberate infection, provides that the court must  disqualify the person from keeping animals for a specified period.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment Nos 7 and 8 are minor technical amendments to  clause 11.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We also want to ensure that any disqualification is not  circumvented by transferring animals to another person in name only, while  retaining responsibility for their day-to-day management. I have taken legal  advice on the matter and propose to extend the meaning of &ldquo;keeping or dealing  in animals&rdquo; to include having custody, control or possession of an animal. That  is provided for in amendment No 9.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The Committee for  Agriculture and Rural Development supports the amendments as explained and  amplified by the Minister. The Committee and the Department are united in their  condemnation of the few individuals in the sector that would risk the  agriculture industry and the Northern    Ireland economy by deliberately infecting  their animals to secure personal financial gain.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee sought to have repeat offenders disqualified  from &ldquo;keeping or dealing in&rdquo; animals, and, following consultation between the  Department and the Minister of State for Northern Ireland, that has been  achieved. The Committee congratulates the Department and the Minister on  securing that important deterrent.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee sought to introduce mandatory custodial  sentences for repeat offenders. However, the Minister of State felt that it was  for the judiciary to decide on the level and extent of sentences; no doubt we  will come back to that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I repeat the message that the Committee sent out loud and  clear to those who have no regard for the industry or no concern for the  welfare of animals: the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development will  encourage and support the Department in ensuring that people who deliberately  infect animals for financial gain will face the severest possible penalties.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: In  its discussion with the NIO, did the Committee give any consideration to the  level of penalties, which are further described in subsection (2), and whether  it was appropriate to set a higher threshold of punish&shy;ment for a repeat  offence instead of maintaining the same threshold and solely increasing the  focus on the issue of whether or not livestock could be kept?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I thank the Member  for his question. However, I want to make it clear that the Committee was not  negotiating on those issues. As I stated, we made our position clear. I repeat:  the Committee sought to introduce mandatory custodial sentences for repeat  offenders. However, the Minister of State felt that that decision was one for  the judiciary.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that we repeat the message loudly and  clearly: the Department has the blessing of the House to come down like a ton  of bricks on people who deliberately infect their animals and destroy an  industry. We must send that message loudly and clearly from the House. Therefore,  the Committee supports the amendments.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I, too, support the amendments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Deliberate infection of animals is a very sensitive  subject, and there is no evidence that the practice is commonplace. As the Committee  Chairperson outlined, during meetings between the Committee and the Department  and stakeholders, it was felt that extra penalties should be available for use  against repeat offenders. However, as has been said, the issue of fines and  extra penalties is a reserved matter. The Committee was united in its view that  repeat offenders should face stern penalties.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is very serious to imply that there has been deliberate  infection of animals. On the other hand, there have been allegations from an  array of sources that infection, primarily brucellosis, is being intentionally  introduced to cause the enforced slaughter of the herds and payment of  considerable compensation. What is to stop a person who is disqualified from  keeping animals from transferring ownership of them to family members and  friends?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Blameless farmers are having their herds restricted due to  the unprincipled actions of others. The Department requires the compulsory  legal powers to take disciplinary action that will deter possible offenders and  look after responsible farmers.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I declare an interest as a farmer. It may come as a surprise to many Members to  hear that I have supported the Department in getting tougher in amendment No 6.  In that sense, history is being made. The amendment is good. The Committee was  determined to ensure that the Bill recognised the difference between those who  deliberately flout the law and are guilty of offences and innocent farmers who  often get caught out on a very minor technicality. I want to see innocent  farmers being protected and the guilty being made to pay.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am all too aware of the history of DARD, and there is  some suspicion about that. However, I assure Members that we have acted in the  best interests of the entire farming community.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am also pleased that the words &ldquo;keeping or dealing&rdquo; were  inserted in amendment No 6. The issue of keeping or dealing in livestock or  animals was debated in the Committee. The insertion of the word &ldquo;dealing&rdquo; was critical,  because a departmental official &mdash; I think that he was the legal adviser &mdash; said  to the Committee:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">I would have thought that &ldquo;keeping&rdquo; would be the act  of, perhaps, engaging in a personal farm business, whereas &ldquo;dealing&rdquo; would be  those who may say that they are not farmers but commercial dealers, and that  they do not hold animals &mdash; the animals come in the back of the farm and go out  the front door.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Committee was very keen that those who engage  in &ldquo;dealing&rdquo; would also be subject to the regulation, simply because we did not  want to leave any gap in the regulation or the legislation that would allow  them to get off when they may have deliberately infected not just one herd but  several herds.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My party and I support the amendments. I thank the Committee  and the departmental officials who returned to the Committee on several  occasions to discuss the issue.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  want to reiterate the point that I made in my intervention during the  Chairperson&rsquo;s speech. In its current form, clause 11(2) outlines that the  penalties, including potential imprisonment, that would be imposed for a repeat  offence are the same as those for a first offence even though the Committee has  sought to introduce mandatory disqualification from keeping livestock to  enhance penalties in that area. Tom Elliott and Willie Clarke talked about  supporting the Department in dealing seriously with any repeat offenders to  defend the interests of ordinary farmers. There seems to be a question about  whether the Minister should seek the Minister of State&rsquo;s agreement to an  enhanced penalty in that area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I note Willie Clarke&rsquo;s point that it is remarkably easy to  change the name of the keeper of livestock. If another family member, friend or  neighbour became the official keeper of the livestock in question, the penalty  might be no greater. Therefore, although significant progress has been made, it  might be possible to make further progress through an amendment at Further  Consideration Stage.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr W McCrea</strong>:  As a member of the Committee, I join with the Chairperson and thank the  Department for working with us on this sensitive issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee&rsquo;s report states that the Department and the  Committee are:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;united in their condemnation of those few individuals  that would risk the agricultural industry and the Northern Ireland economy&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Does the Minister have any statistics on the  percentage of individuals who have been found guilty of such an offence? That  is important.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When the Bill came to the Committee, the Minister stressed  the legislation&rsquo;s importance in dealing with diseases of animals. We totally  agree. As I said earlier, members had varying views on the issues in the Bill.  However, there was absolutely no disagreement between the Department and the  Committee about anyone who deliberately seeks to infect their animals for  financial gain. Such action would destroy the industry. We want to protect  innocent farmers from penalties and ensure that guilty offenders are  prosecuted.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Ford mentioned penalties. The Committee did not have the  opportunity to deal with that issue, because it is not a devolved matter. The  courts are the responsibility of the Minister of State. Therefore, we left it  to the Department and the Minister to deal with the Minister of State on that  issue, and the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development took the advice  she was given on the matter. If there is a way to strengthen the legislation,  we should take it. The Committee was unanimous in its view that people who  deliberately infect their animals should not escape prosecution and should be  removed from the farming industry completely. Such action has threatened and  brought destruction to the Northern    Ireland economy and the whole industry.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Any unscrupulous operator or rogue should be dealt with in  that way, because the industry in Northern Ireland has a reputation  worldwide, and, therefore, we are not willing to allow anyone to threaten that  reputation for simple financial gain. Therefore, it will be interesting to see  whether the Minister can reconsider ways to strengthen the legislation and  whether she will return to the Minister of State to determine whether some  matters can be enhanced. It is correct to point out that we want to ensure that  there is no way around legislation. As other Members have mentioned, we must ensure  that family members cannot become keepers and divert &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I recall that issue being debated in the Committee as a matter of human rights.  We discussed whether it was right that, if a son had played no part in the  deliberate infection of animals or other rogue activity, as Dr McCrea  described, he or any other family member should be held liable and not be  allowed to keep other animals on the farm just because of the father&rsquo;s, or any  other family member&rsquo;s, wrongdoing. We must be careful about that; I recall that  we discussed that issue at length.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr W McCrea</strong>:  I agree that no son or other family member should be penalised if they are  totally innocent. However, we must also be careful that we do not allow some  people to escape the full rigours of the law. We must ensure that the industry  is protected and that farmers in general &mdash; 99&middot;99% of the farming community &mdash;  are not threatened by an unscrupulous dealer or a rogue who tries, for his own  ends, to get around regulations and the law. I support the amendments.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I support Minister Gildernew&rsquo;s amendments. As a member of the Committee for  Agriculture and Rural Development, I have been observing the progress of the  Bill closely on behalf of constituents who have made me aware of the issues. My  constituency is a mix of rural and urban areas, and, as someone who lives in  the rural part of Strangford, it is startlingly clear to me that the vast  majority of farmers are hardworking men and women who strive to making their  living within the confines of the law.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That being the marker, it is also clear to me that, after  years of harsh enforcement and seemingly useless and sometimes expensive EU  legislation, there is a deep-seated distrust between farmers and the Department  of Agriculture and Rural Development, which is supposed to be there to help  farmers: that is a fact. As I sat on the Committee I could see why that  relationship is so tenuous, and I sought to consider the Bill as if I were a  farmer myself, in need of the protection and guidance of the legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill and its proposed amendments have achieved  something. Time does not permit me to explore every aspect of the Bill; I am  only going to speak about the amendments to clause 11, which deals with the  deliberate infection of animals and its prevention in the Province. Clause 11  will insert new articles 5A and 5B into the Diseases of Animals (Northern Ireland) Order  1981 and, according to the explanatory and financial memorandum that  accompanies the Bill:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;creates an offence of deliberately causing an animal  or bird to be infected with disease or knowingly acquiring or taking possession  of such an animal or bird.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The mair at hits a hannlin thair ir a wee wheen o&rsquo; fowk at  wud dae oniething tae turn a pun, amang thae things acceptin&rsquo; a baste knawin  hit tae bae seek at gaes oan tae spread the seekness. Thon&rsquo;s hoo seeknesses ir  spread an hits needfu&rsquo; at thair bes laa agin thon practice wi&rsquo; fair controls  an&rsquo; punishments brocht in.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is unfortunate that there is a tiny minority of people  who are willing to do anything to turn a profit, including knowingly accepting  an animal that is diseased and which spreads the disease further. The way in  which such diseases are spread makes it essential that such practices are  legislated against with fair controls and punishments put in place.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When I speak to farmers in my area, they express their  disgust at the few who could give them a bad reputation, and, worse than that,  a bad relationship with DARD and other farmers. The Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union has agreed that the controls must be in place for  those who blatantly and negligently disregard safety procedures for their own  ends.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The level and  extent of illegal practices has been mentioned. Evidence was brought to the  Committee by departmental officials that referred to a PhD study, which,  although it was not conclusive, indicated that the levels of deliberately  infected animals varied but could stand at 13% at their highest. It is  important that Members have that in mind when they discuss the issues. Everyone  who has contributed to the debate has said that we are talking about a few  unscrupulous people who do not care about the industry.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I thank the Member for his comments. Having examined the statistics that Mr  Paisley Jnr mentioned, it is clear that there are some people who, oblivious to  the betterment of the industry, are intent on doing their own thing for their  own ends.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 11 is essential to the Bill. Those who have  knowingly taken on board an infected animal must know that they are doing  wrong. That must be specifically addressed, and that is what the Bill will do.  The Bill will allow the courts to disqualify those people from keeping or  dealing in any animals or poultry after conviction of such an offence.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That clause is not particular to Northern Ireland. The Animal Health  and Welfare (Scotland)  Act 2006 has similar provisions that go further through a series of  post-conviction orders. Although that Act includes disqualification from owning  or keeping animals, it also prohibits transporting, working with, using, riding  or driving animals. The controls in that Act are very strict.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Unlike the Scottish legislation, the Bill does not indicate  whether the Department has powers of seizure should a person disqualified from  keeping or dealing with animals breach that disqualification. However, it  provides an avenue for appeals against orders. That is essential for those who  have been duped and were not aware of the full facts about the animal, because  there are cases when that could happen.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is not a mechanism for a witch-hunt of anyone  possessing a diseased animal; it is a mechanism for ensuring that those who  knowingly cause the spread of disease can be convicted and appropriate  punishment meted out. The Bill will deprive anyone convicted of an offence of  compensation for the loss of animals to which the offence relates. That does  not mean that anyone with an infected animal will automatically have  compensation withdrawn. It means that those who have knowingly and purposely  spread the disease will not be entitled to compensation. That is a basic legal  principle; people must come to the table with clean hands.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are aware of the cost of animal diseases to DARD and farmers.  Brucellosis, as other Members have said, costs some &pound;7 million a year. It is in  everyone&rsquo;s interest &mdash; the farmers, the Department and Members &mdash; to ensure that  the disease is eradicated. That is the thrust of the Bill: to protect the  genuine farmers, who work from morning to night to eke out a living. The only  people who will not be the winners in this case are the tiny minority of people  who are involved in actions that harm the rest of the farming community.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have changed aspects of the Bill, and the Committee has  objected to elements that we felt were not in the best interests of farmers. We  have ensured, to the best of our ability, that the Bill will not be used as a  way for the Department to cut the costs of compensation for those who deserve it.  We have worked with the Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union  and other bodies, and have spoken to individual farmers. We believe that the  proposed amendments are essential protective components.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the Assembly to support amendment Nos 6, 7, 8 and 9  to ensure that the deliberate infection of animals is recorded as what it is: a  crime against the farming community as a whole. It is something that can hurt  everyone. We must ensure that the Bill contains the right safeguards and  punishments. The legislation will protect farmers who need protection, in some  cases against the Department, although I hope that that will not be the case. I  support the Bill and the amendments, and I urge Members to do the same.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.  The debate has been a good reflection of what is contained in the legislation.  There has been a lot of interest in what we can do to punish people who  deliberately infect animals.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The penalty for the offence of the deliberate infection of  animals is imprisonment for a period of up to two years or an unlimited fine,  or both. The courts can hand down a custodial sentence even for a first  offence. It is important to reiterate that. In the case of a first offence, the  court will have the discretion to impose an additional penalty of  disqualification from keeping animals. The court will take into account the  circumstances of the case, and the evidence presented by both the prosecution  and defence. It is right that the courts should determine that matter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the case of a repeat offender, a more robust approach is  needed. Amendment No 6 will make it compulsory for the court to impose a period  of disqualification. I hope that that delivers a clear message that anyone  found guilty of deliberately infecting an animal with disease will suffer heavy  penalties. I realise that that is an issue in which Dr McCrea, the Chairperson  of the Committee, Mr Ford and others have been very interested. I will revisit  the issue and discuss with officials whether there is a need to impose further  penalties.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise that the Department and I cannot prevent a  person who is prohibited from keeping animals from transferring their animals  to a family member, friend or business associate. That disqualified person will  have to do something with the animals, perhaps transfer them or sell them, but  I understand the point. We have addressed that problem by extending what is  covered by the prohibition from keeping or dealing with animals. That will now  include having custody, control or possession of an animal or bird, or being  concerned in the management or control of a body whose activities include  keeping or dealing in animals or poultry. Powers are in place to ensure that it  will be very difficult for anyone to get around the rules that we are bringing  in through the legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Questions were asked about the extent of the problem. There  is no evidence to suggest that it is a widespread problem, but even a single  case of deliberate infection of an animal is completely unacceptable on grounds  of both welfare and disease control. I am particularly concerned about  allegations of the deliberate infection of animals with brucellosis to obtain  compensation. If that is happening, it must be stamped out. I am determined to  take action when there is sufficient evidence to warrant prosecution. I hope  that such action will not be necessary and that the new robust powers will  deter anyone who may be thinking of deliberately infecting an animal.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Our success in trying to eradicate brucellosis is indicated  by the fact that one or two isolated incidents account for 13% of all  brucellosis cases, as outlined in the PhD study to which the Chairperson  referred. We have almost got to the nub of the problem, and deliberate infection  can skew our figures out of all proportion. It is important that offenders will  face a custodial sentence and that we send out a strong message. People who are  involved in deliberate infection know who they are. The House has shown  unanimous support for the legislation, and, indeed, all parties have been  exercised about the deliberate infection of animals.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Deliberately infecting animals to get compensation flies in  the face of the work of farmers who work hard in all weather and at all hours  of the day and night to look after their animals. It flies in the face of what  so many people are working so hard to achieve. The House must send out a strong  message today: there will be no hiding place for people involved in deliberate  infection. People who are found guilty will find no succour from their elected  representatives. We must ensure that people who are involved in such activity,  or are thinking about becoming involved, know that they will not be able to  hide from their elected representatives.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am sorry for getting carried away, a Cheann Comhairle. I  appreciate the level of maturity that has been displayed in the House; we are  clearly all passionate about this matter.</p>

    <p class="B3BodyTextClause">Clause 12 (Seizure and destruction of things liable  to spread disease)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  We now come to the fourth group of amendments for debate. With amendment No 10,  it will be convenient to debate amendment No 13.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The amendments deal with the withdrawal of the part of the  Bill that concerns the valuation of items that are seized to prevent the spread  of disease. Members should note that amendment No 13 is consequential to  amendment No 10. Therefore, if amendment No 10 is not made, I will not call  amendment No 13.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.  We are nearly there.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I beg to move amendment No 10: In page 11, leave out lines  1 and 2.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The following amendment stood on the Marshalled List:</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">No 13: In schedule 3, page 21, line 34, leave out from &ldquo;In  Article 6(3)&rdquo; to &ldquo;that time&rsquo;.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="SmallQuote"><span style="font-size:8.5pt; ">[The Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development (Ms Gildernew).]</span></span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Amendment No 10 will remove clause 12(c)  from the Bill. Clause 12 extends the range of items that may be seized to  prevent the spread of disease so that it includes anything that is animate or  inanimate. Clause 12(c) provides for compensation for seized items at their  value at the time of seizure.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the case of items that are contaminated with disease,  for example, eggs from an infected flock, the resulting compensation may be nil  because the eggs have no value. That would be very unfair, and it would make it  extremely difficult for farmers to restock following a disease outbreak. In  fact, it is very likely to result in a farmer going out of business just  because he or she has been unfortunate enough to have a disease outbreak on  their premises.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 10, which I propose on legal advice that I  have received, will mean that the existing arrangements for compensation for  seized items will continue to apply. That means that compensation will be  calculated as if the seized items were not infected with disease.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 13 is a minor consequential amendment to  schedule 3, which concerns repeals.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: My Committee Clerk  gave me a 45 minute speech on this section. However, for the sanity of the  House and me, I simply say that clause 12 and schedule 3 should be amended as  was agreed by the Committee and the Department. The Committee agrees to the  text of the amendment as outlined by the Minister.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  A precedent has obviously been set, so I will not break it. I have always  supported farmers getting a fair value for their product when receiving  compensation. The Minister has outlined how that will happen, so I am quite  happy to support the amendment.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: In the spirit of succinctness, I will  also keep my comments very brief.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank all the Members who contributed to the debate  today. It has been a very professional, mature and courteous debate. Business  has been carried out in a very helpful manner. Nobody can be in any doubt about  the importance that this House places on the agricultural industry and the  passion, care and concern that Members have for our farmers. That will be very  evident to anybody who looks at the Hansard report. This is a good piece of  legislation, and I am very pleased to respond to the debate. I look forward to  the Further Consideration Stage with the Committee for Agriculture and Rural  Development. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>

    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="8"></a>Private Members&rsquo; Business</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Northern    Ireland Block Grant</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30 minutes for  the debate. The proposer will have 10 minutes to propose the motion and 10  minutes in which to make a winding-up speech. One amendment has been selected  and published on the Marshalled List. The proposer of the amendment will have  10 minutes to propose and five minutes in which to make a winding-up speech.  All other Members who are called will have five minutes in which to speak.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly opposes any reduction in the Northern Ireland  block grant during the next comprehensive spending review.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion was tabled because there is considerable public  interest and concern about the possibility of significant reductions in the  block grant over the lifetime of either a comprehensive spending review (CSR)  period or effectively the same thing under a different name. We are coming  towards the end of the current CSR period, and the next Government will put  something in place.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Efficiencies have been demanded of and met by all our  Departments. That situation is fairly clear. Efficiencies have been delivered  at a rate of between 2% and 3% a year over the past five or six years. The  Chancellor, Alistair Darling, has indicated that approximately &pound;9 billion of  cuts must be made in the next financial year. Our share of that is likely to be  in the region of &pound;120 million.</p>
    <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Dallat] in the Chair)</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There have been some minor disparities &mdash; but disparities  nonetheless &mdash; in the outlooks of various political parties that expect to form  the next Westminster Government. The Conservative Party has made it clear that  it would make reductions in the order of 10%. The Labour Party has equivocated  on the matter, but, depending on who one speaks to, it appears that as with the  Conservatives, under Labour it will be 8%, 9% or possibly 10%. Therefore,  whatever the outcome of the election, there is no doubt that budgetary  constraints will be even tighter in the next parliamentary term than they have  been in this one.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I shall now deal briefly with the amendment, which will be  moved on behalf of the Ulster Unionist Party by Mr McNarry or Mr Beggs:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the Northern    Ireland block grant could be reduced by up  to 10 per cent &hellip; and calls on the Assembly to set up an ad-hoc Budgetary Review  Committee to secure cross-party support on plans to manage such potential reductions  in public expenditure.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Our problem is that the amendment appears to adopt  a defeatist attitude. It almost accepts that cuts will happen. If the larger  partner in a relationship spells out that there will be 10% cuts, it is very  difficult for the smaller partner to disagree. I understand the difficulty in  which the UUP finds itself, but the amendment does not address it in any way.  In fact, the amendment draws attention to the fact that one party that may well  form the Government after May 2010 will make those cuts and, therefore, we will  just have to live with them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP motion does not accept that defeatist attitude. If  we are faced with cuts of that magnitude, there will be serious difficulties  for front line services. Therefore, the DUP does not accept the premise that  cuts are inevitable and that we will then have to try to manage them and decide  which Departments have to shoulder the burden. Rather than rationalising cuts,  we want to fight the problem at its source.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the past two years, the Assembly and the Executive have  made it clear that the economy is at the heart of the Programme for Government  (PFG). Either we maintain and support the PFG, so that, in the long term, we  become less dependent on the public sector and the state, or we proceed on a  vicious circle whereby, as we cut and cut spending, it will become more  difficult to increase the private sector and we will find ourselves in a worse  position than the one in which we are at the moment. The DUP&rsquo;s view is that we  will only be able to work our way out of the problem by increasing the number  of people in work and by endeavouring to ensure that higher-value jobs are  created here.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Any incoming Government that indicates that there will be  across-the-board cuts of 10% needs to be confronted with the picture of what  that will do to our attempts to reduce our dependency on the public purse. Such  cuts would set our efforts back by years, if not by a generation. Accepting  cuts of that scale would ensure not just that front line services in the public  sector would be reduced, but that our investment in the private sector would be  severely restricted. Within 12 to 18 months, our difficult and problematic  situation would be made even worse.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Any country in which two thirds of the active workforce is  directly or indirectly dependent on the state for employment must take action  to develop its private sector. If we do not take such action, we will find that  as the developed world moves out of recession, we will again be caught in a  difficult position. That will be made even more difficult by the cuts, and it  will be compounded further by our inability to invest in the private sector and  in development and growth therein.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that the motion will command support across the  House. We are now in 2009, having emerged from a murder campaign that lasted  through the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. That campaign has now ended. However, given  the context that it created, it was always going to be difficult to attract  inward investors and to give indigenous entrepreneurs the support that they  needed to be more competitive. More than ever, we need to support the private  sector and indigenous companies over the next five to 10 years to make them  more attractive and competitive so that our ultra-dependency on the public  sector diminishes over time. Although no one expects or intends that that will  happen within 12 to 18 months, it certainly will not happen within the next 10  to 15 years unless we get to grips with how the block grant will be allocated  over the next three years, beyond the current spending review period.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We need to tackle that matter as a united Assembly that can  go to an incoming Government. We are speaking to various people at Westminster already, and  we need to continue doing that, particularly so when a new Government, whatever  its complexion, takes up the reins of office. We must not go to them with a  begging bowl; we must outline to them the facts of the position that Northern Ireland  has been and is in. We must also make it clear that we can build on the private  sector only if there is no further reduction in the block grant.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That is why we have brought the motion before the Assembly.  I expect and hope that it will be supported across the Chamber.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I beg to move the following amendment: At end insert</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;; recognises that after the next Westminster  election, whatever the outcome, the Northern Ireland block grant could be  reduced by up to 10 per cent; further recognises that the Executive and  Assembly must prepare for this potential outcome; and calls on the Assembly to  set up an ad-hoc budgetary review Committee to secure cross-party support on  plans to manage such potential reductions in public expenditure.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One wonders whether the DUP motion is positive evidence  that, despite division in its partner party, Sinn F&eacute;in, and splits in the DUP,  both parties are capable of overcoming their difficulties and doing whatever is  necessary to keep the Executive in business. They admit that that cannot be  done now without deals and money. From a DUP perspective, the sponsors of the  motion are seemingly representative of two of the three wings that are  operating in the DUP. Therefore, any signs of a temporary ending of the  upheaval inside that party are most certainly to be welcomed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For those reasons and more, the Ulster Unionists tabled the  amendment, not to detract from the motion, but to strengthen its message. When  I say &ldquo;more&rdquo;, I mean that the amendment takes the form of friendly  chastisement, conveying the general opinion that is shared by the House and the  public that we are all fed up with the DUP tabling sound bite motions that are  more to do with an election manifesto and its own divisions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Nevertheless, the House and the public can see right  through those antics and are well aware of how slow the DUP has been in getting  interested in the block grant and the Barnett formula. Can we now expect that  it will soon be pressing for a similar motion in that other place where its  members engage in double-jobbing practices and where changes to the Barnett formula  are most likely to be decided? Will we hear today from the DUP about the  outcome of any successful meetings with the Chancellor on keeping Barnett  intact? Will we hear about how the DUP intends to protect Northern Ireland  from cuts? Will we hear about representations made by the DUP to its other  republican chums in Scotland,  the Scottish National Party, about a dual approach on Barnett consequentials?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The House would be gratefully enlightened to be told just  what the DUP has been doing to protect Northern Ireland from detrimental  changes to the block grant. In the absence of hearing any answers from the DUP  today, I suspect that we will be able to make our own judgements, as will the  public, on what the lead party in the Assembly is really doing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We all know the DUP&rsquo;s intention in moving the motion: its  Members plan to say that the cuts to the block grant have nothing to do with  them. They will say that they voted against cuts and proposed a motion in order  to blame whichever party wins the next general election. Of course, they can  say that. However, that surreal version of events is typical of the DUP.  Nothing is ever their fault: someone else is always to blame; which, of course,  is nonsense. They have been in the driving seat for almost three years and have  run the Executive like a closed shop. Inaction and incompetence on a host of  issues have been theirs and theirs alone.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Commentators say that, in the present financial climate,  there is no way that the Westminster Government can sustain the block grant  without cuts. Therefore, we must find a way to do so. However, without putting  a compelling case on behalf of Northern Ireland,  United Kingdom  public opinion will not allow that to happen. No one in the rest of the United  Kingdom will be willing to accept the situation in which Northern Ireland is,  uniquely, spared the cuts in the national Budget that have been made inevitable  by the level of borrowing undertaken by the Labour Government. Similarly, Northern Ireland cannot expect the Westminster &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>: <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  What are you saying from a sedentary position?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  Is that an invitation to intervene?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I think that the Member is permitting you to speak, Mr Campbell.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  I was using the word &ldquo;defeatist&rdquo; again. Mr McNarry and I were on &lsquo;Stormont  Live&rsquo;. Perhaps, for the benefit of the House, he will repeat the indication and  prophecy he made regarding the outcome of the Westminster election.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I do not know what &lsquo;Stormont Live&rsquo; has got to do with the debate. However,  since you have introduced it, may I ask you again how safe your seat is? Sit  where you are, and you can answer it later.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I apologise, Mr Deputy Speaker; I know that I am supposed to speak through the  Chair.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. I encourage the Member to stick to the subject.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I think that we have established that the Member&rsquo;s seat is not all that safe.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr S Wilson)</strong>: On a point of order, Mr Deputy  Speaker. What have you, as Deputy Speaker, done to the honourable Member to  invite him to ask you how safe your seat is? I thought that you had been  sitting fairly quietly and not in any way trying to provoke him. Perhaps you  will inform the Member of the proper way to address the House, so that,  subsequently, he might be more accurate in what he is saying as well.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Please continue, Mr McNarry.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I will give way to waffling anytime.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland cannot reasonably expect the  Westminster Government to minimise any cuts to the block grant unless there has  been demonstrable action by the Northern Ireland Executive to put their own  financial house in order first. Our amendment tasks us to do just that. It gives  the emphasis required to prepare now to make a forceful case for Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Does anybody seriously think that the efficiency savings,  more properly called cuts, which the Labour Government have announced, will not  happen after the 2010 election, regardless of who wins? The Labour Party says  that there will be 9&middot;5% cuts and the Conservative Party says that there will be  10%: there is no great difference. The only issue is not when or if there will  be cuts in public spending, but how big they will be.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">No one wants there to be cuts to the Northern Ireland  block grant; no one is going to vote for cuts. That is why the motion is so  feeble. The motion takes no account of reality, but the amendment does.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I, above all people, should not be surprised at the pretentiousness  of the DUP. Over a year ago, I battered away at them and warned them of the  black hole in the Budget, and they would not listen. Denial followed denial.  For over a year, there was no action from the DUP as unemployment more than  doubled on their watch. That detachment from reality and the in-denial mindset  that is portrayed by the DUP motion will come as a surprise to no one.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Westminster will also take note that it was on the DUP&rsquo;s  watch that the Minister of Finance and Personnel announced &pound;370 million worth  of cuts, which play no part in the efficiency savings demanded by Whitehall,  but which tell Westminster more about the deficiencies in DFP. We must not blur  the edges of that, because that is the stark reality. So too is the &pound;370 million  worth of cuts, which will at least double by election time 2010 and which the  DUP fears.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The feeble motion proposed by the DUP is another example of  that party trying to evade responsibility when it is to blame for the lack of  action on budgetary reform for well over a year, during the worst financial  crisis that the world has seen since 1929. The House knows it, and the public  can see it. The Ulster Unionist Party&rsquo;s amendment, which we trust will find  unanimous support in the Assembly, takes us beyond the beat-your-chest rhetoric  that we have heard from the DUP to actually saying that there is a problem with  Northern Ireland plc.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Westminster  requires money, and it has the power to cut the block grant, which is our  lifeline. Northern Ireland  is already struggling financially, and that struggle will not disappear after  the general election next year; in fact, it will get worse, and its seriousness  will be added to by any cut in the block grant. The task is to identify the  problem, but some might say that that is the easy part. What is not so easy is  determining how to minimise the problem.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To the prospers of the DUP motion I say that their interest  in the Barnett formula and their declared opposition to reductions in the block  grant are very welcome, if somewhat belated, considering that the DUP has the  largest number of members on the Committee for Finance and Personnel. As far  back as 2007, that Committee highlighted that the ongoing debate on the options  for the funding of devolution in Scotland  had the potential to open up the debate on the future of the Barnett formula  for Northern Ireland.  The Committee recommended that the Executive should assess that, and DFP  responded by saying that it would keep it under consideration. However, we now  have our third DUP Minister of Finance and Personnel, with little evidence of  any movement or action on that issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Only a few months ago, on 26 March 2009, not one of the  four DUP members of the Finance and Personnel Committee felt it worthwhile to  attend a meeting with a Lord&rsquo;s Select Committee &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should draw his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Let us have no more talk of going into another crisis &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I support the amendment.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Sinn F&eacute;in supports the motion and  opposes the amendment. Gregory Campbell made some pertinent comments about the  amendment. However, I would add that the setting up of an ad hoc budgetary  review Committee would effectively duplicate the work and impinge on the  existing remits of the Assembly&rsquo;s Statutory Committees, not least the Committee  for Finance and Personnel with its specific role in examining the Budget  proposals.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The fact that the Ulster Unionist Party has found it  necessary to table the amendment betrays a considerable lack of confidence in  the influence that it would have at the seat of Government, and that is  contrary to what their spokespersons have been telling us all for some time. It  would appear to indicate that that party really sees no effective outcome in a  general election result that would favour their partners, the Conservative  Party. It certainly reflects no particular advantage for this region or for the  issues that the Assembly is dealing with.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The continued uncertainty about the economic circumstances  is already impacting on the proposed budgetary process, and the motion is  valuable in assisting the parties to begin to address those issues. The  Department of Finance and Personnel initiated a review of the Executive&rsquo;s  future Budget process more than a year ago, and I welcome the fact that  Minister is present in the Chamber.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Finance and Personnel made a substantive  submission on that issue, which included the views of the other Statutory  Committees that it consulted. Despite the Committee&rsquo;s pressing for an outcome,  the Department has not brought forward any proposals.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When I was Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and  Personnel, I raised the issue of the reviews of the in-year monitoring process  and of the Budget process during the Final Stage of the Budget Bill in June  2009. The Minister of Finance and Personnel at the time, Nigel Dodds, said in  response:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Those will be considered during the summer by my  successor, and he aims to provide the reports to the Committee before the next  Assembly session.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official Report, Vol 42, No 6, p369, col 1]</span></span>.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Committee is still waiting for that response  and has heard nothing about the reviews. I hope that the Minister will be able  to give the Committee some encouraging indication of when those reviews and  outcomes will be made available.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If a firm budgetary process can be established in the  Assembly well in advance of the next comprehensive spending review, which is  likely to be in the summer or autumn of 2010, that would empower and enable all  Statutory Committees to engage with their respective Departments and their  plans to manage any potential reductions in public expenditure.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We must also take account of the fact that the House of  Lords Barnett Formula Select Committee reported that the Barnett formula is not  fit for purpose because of population changes, and it does not reflect needs.  That Committee proposes a needs-based process. We must start to consider the  implications of that: at Westminster,  it is not a complete departure from the Barnett formula, but it might be a  substantial amendment with pluses and minuses.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We need the outcome of the reviews on the in-year  monitoring and budgetary processes so that we can begin to plan the Budget.  However, we must also start to take account of what is likely to be the outcome  of the review of the Barnett formula.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  support the motion that the Assembly oppose any reduction in the Northern Ireland  block grant. I understand the thinking behind the amendment, but I cannot  support it. We would be trying to argue two cases at once, and that would not  be solid ground to stand on.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The amendment refers to the possibility of a 10% cut in the  block grant. The effects of such a cut on the social and economic life of Northern Ireland  would be dramatic, a prospect not to be countenanced. It has not been fully  revealed how that would be reflected in the Barnett consequentials. The  economist Victor Hewitt was on television last week, and he indicated that a  10% cut in Department for Employment and Learning spending would equal &pound;800  million, although that would be somewhat less according to the Barnett  consequentials. A small real increase in spending caused difficulties in the  current funding round, so a 10% cut would lead to drastic consequences.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It will be a hard case to make that no cuts should be made  to the block grant. Members could imagine the reaction if we were to put the  wording of the motion on a postcard and send it to the Treasury. I doubt  whether we would receive a postcard back saying that the Treasury thought that  that was a fine idea, and it would agree to it at once. If the motion is to go  anywhere, it requires substantial work.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, there is a strong case to be made. There has been  a significant shift in thinking in a number of recent influential reports from  the Barnett formula to a more needs-based approach. The Barnett formula has its  ups and downs: it is simple, crude and effective; it has many weaknesses; it is  not needs-based or transparent; and it leaves the Treasury with too much  control.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will refer to three pieces of evidence that concern the  shift to a needs-based approach. First, in Scotland, the Calman Commission  examined Scottish devolution in general, but with particular reference to  financial issues. Its radical report refers to devolved taxation and the UK and Scottish  Parliaments&rsquo; achieving that through sharing the yield of income tax.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It mentions various other taxes, such as stamp  duty, landfill tax and air passenger duty being devolved and allowing the  Scottish Parliament to introduce specified new taxes to Scotland. That  is a radical approach. We many not have done the analysis here to know whether  we are ready for such a stance. The report goes on to state:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Until such times as a proper assessment of relative  spending need across the UK  is carried out, the Barnett formula, should continue&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The report&rsquo;s authors are referencing the need for a  proper assessment of relative spending.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Similarly in Wales, an independent commission  also makes recommendations for improving the flexibility of the existing  system, but says, importantly:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;In the medium term the funding arrangements for Wales should be  based on relative needs.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The House of Lords Select Committee on the Barnett formula  stated:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;on the basis of our initial analysis, we believe that  Scotland now has markedly  lower overall need than Wales  and Northern Ireland in  comparison to England.  The current allocation of spending does not properly reflect this basic  pattern&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Of course, the whole report is predicated on the need  to move from a Barnett formula mechanism to a mechanism that is needs based.  Both Scotland and Wales have done  substantial work in that arena, and we have not.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The current thinking is moving towards a needs-based  approach, and that case must be developed. Previously in the House, the SDLP  advocated the setting up of a Committee to reprofile the existing Budget. We  still urge the Minister to do that, but ask him to give it the extra task of  building up the needs case for Northern    Ireland. There is time to do that work &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member please bring his remarks to a close?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  Only by creating that substantial case, based on the evidence that the House of  Lords was aware of &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: That  has been referred to frequently in the Chamber. Only through such an approach  can we advance that cause with the Treasury.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  The Alliance Party is happy to support the motion. Like other parties, we have  concerns about the amendment; we are all opposed to cuts in the Northern Ireland  block grant. Stating our opposition does not mean that we are, necessarily, in  denial of the realities of the challenge before us, but it is a fight worth  fighting, and one that we cannot duck.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is worth reflecting that there is a range of options  facing the British Government with regard to the approach that they have taken  and, no doubt, that discussion will colour much of the general election  campaign. The Conservative Party, in the form of its sister party, the Ulster  Unionist, has talked of 10% cuts. The Labour Party has not talked about 9%  cuts; it has talked about &pound;9 billion in cuts, and it is important that we make  distinctions between absolutes and percentages; there is a world of difference.  No doubt, any future Labour Government would face similar challenges.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We must accept that debt is a reality for Governments  around the world. The notion that a debt must be removed in one fell swoop is a  fallacy. There are issues about the balance between cuts in spending versus  increases in taxation, and the increased policy focus on economic growth, which  in itself brings in increased tax revenues. There are options open to  Governments. There is also the issue of timing and how quickly one chooses to  try to remove one&rsquo;s fiscal stimulus. Clearly, there is a lesson to be learned  from the great depression, when the United States came out of the  initial new deal far too quickly and went back into recession. Much discussion  needs to take place at a national level about what should happen.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On the consequences here, I want to reflect on the Ulster  Unionist Party&rsquo;s approach, given that it has tied itself so clearly to the  approach of cuts, and only cuts, as the way to address the situation. One gets  the impression that the Ulster Unionist Party is luxuriating in the prospect of  cuts.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: Is  the Member advocating tax increases?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: My  party is quite happy to consider a range of options, which would include  looking at taxation issues &mdash; absolutely. There is a balance to be struck,  especially if the issue of cuts is considered. The Ulster Unionist Party is not  even aware of the level of the block grant. On &lsquo;Stormont Live&rsquo;, Mr McNarry  referred to a &pound;4 billion block grant.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is actually twice that. I think that the George Osborne  factor is taking hold in the Ulster Unionist Party, as its Members do not even  know the basic economic facts.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, all that the Ulster Unionists have suggested  today is the establishment of a Committee to look at the issue. They have  damned every other party in the Chamber for inaction, and said that they are  the only ones focused on the issue. Their sole focus on the issue is a  Committee to discuss it. Is that what we are going to speak to the Treasury  about? Do not worry, lads, we are in control of the situation &mdash; we have  established a Committee. We do not need a Committee; we need changes in policy  and approaches.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are a number of different ideas floating around the  Chamber. The DUP has expressed its policy in relation to the institutions. I am  personally sceptical about how far that will go, but it is a start. The SDLP  has put forward its own paper, Sinn F&eacute;in has its ideas, and the Alliance Party  is talking about trying to tackle the costs of division. We are also becoming  more realistic about the inevitability of water charges. We are prepared to see  changes in policies and practices. I have heard nothing of that kind whatsoever  from the Ulster Unionists. All they talk about is the size of the alleged black  hole, and the fact that we need a Committee to sort the problem out. Where are  the actual ideas? Where is their credibility on what they are talking about?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McNarry spoke about the importance of engaging with the  Barnett review. The Alliance Party was the only party that tabled a response to  that. He then went on to attack the DUP for not attending the meeting with the  House of Lords Select Committee. I think it is worth stating, given that Mr  McNarry brought the issue up, that his performance on that evening was less  than impressive. I will not go into the details, in case I embarrass him, but  he did not exactly cover himself in glory with the approach that he took, let  us put it that way.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is fair to say that there is a challenge for us in Northern Ireland  if we are serious about negotiating with the Treasury and putting forward a  number of arguments. First, we need to highlight the severe risk of a  double-dip recession in Northern    Ireland. That may occur here but not in other  parts of the UK.  That is linked to the large public sector share of our economy. If there are  cuts in public spending, it could tip us into recession while others do not go  into recession. That is one argument.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, if we are given some grace in relation to the  potential cuts, that must be seen as an opportunity for us to restructure our  economy and to do things differently. We cannot simply bank that and keep doing  things in the same way. That means coming to terms with the size of the public  sector share of our economy. It means that we have to address new ways of  encouraging indigenous growth in Northern Ireland. It means things  like promoting a green new deal. A lot of those ideas are things that the  Executive have not yet come to terms with themselves. I certainly think that  our credibility would be enhanced if we are seeking to do things differently.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will make a final point about the Ulster Unionists. I  forgot about the one proposal that they have made, which is to ring-fence the  health sector from any cuts. That in itself would be a further  counterproductive argument.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Bring your remarks to a close, please.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  The consequence of doing that would not be a 10% cut but a 20% cut in every  other aspect of government spending, including slashing any investment in  improving our economy for the better.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Your time is up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: It  would be utterly counterproductive.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  I wish to highlight the very real dangers that exist for Northern Ireland  if our block grant is cut. Last week we read and heard in the media that the  level of child poverty in Northern    Ireland is extremely high. We in the  Assembly must ask ourselves whether we should accept that or fight to reduce  it. The level of unemployment, although stabilising, is a concern that the  Assembly must address. Do we accept that or fight to reduce it? If our block  grant is reduced in any way, both those vital areas will be affected, as the  Assembly will be greatly handicapped in its ability to tackle them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Westminster Government must be reminded that Northern Ireland is in a unique situation within  the Union. We are moving forward after a  campaign of terrorism that saw millions of pounds spent on compensation and  security instead of being put into the infrastructure that Northern Ireland  desperately needed, and still needs. Of all areas of the UK, Northern Ireland is the one that  will be damaged most by a reduced block grant.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">All Executive Ministers agreed to the Budget, and all  Ministers wish to have more money at their disposal for projects as diverse as  planning reform, new water mains, new roads, more health screening, greater  assistance for young people in training places, more newbuild homes for the  Housing Executive, and the ability to fund improvement grants.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, we must deal with reality and not live in a  fantasy world. The block grant is not sufficient at present, so a reduction is  out of the question. Northern    Ireland needs an increase in the block  grant. An increase in real terms could allow us to start to address the problem  of unemployment, and more money could be made available to the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment to assist new businesses  or to help to attract foreign investors to Northern Ireland. That would help  the Assembly to reduce the current level of unemployment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">More capital expenditure on infrastructure could be  approved, which would result in better roads, more modern water and sewerage  networks, more places on vocational courses for young people, greater spending  on targeted projects in the Health Service and more newbuild homes for the  public sector. All of that would benefit the construction industry. New homes  with grant-aided home improvements will give families twenty-first century  homes to live in, which is an indicator in working out child poverty figures.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The retail sector will grow as a result of employment in  other sectors, creating more jobs and aiding households to live, not just to  exist from day to day. Getting people into work will tackle the problem of  child poverty.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion, as I believe that the amendment  overlooks the fact that what it proposes is, de facto, already taking place.  Therefore, the amendment is pointless, and it is only there to allow Members to  continue to whinge, rather than take the affirmative action that is necessary.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. I support the motion. Any reduction in the block grant  would prove to be disastrous for many in our communities. The Assembly must do  whatever it can to ensure that that does not happen. We need to put the case  that, in this society, we pay more for fuel, food, insurance and housing.  Equally importantly, we live in a low-pay economy, and any reduction in the  block grant will add serious stress to people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the North of Ireland, home repossessions have increased  by 64%, while they have increased by 4% in England  and Wales,  which have been helped greatly by an effective mortgage relief scheme that has  not been available here. A gloomy picture is painted when it is taken into  consideration that low-income families will receive only 38p a week extra in  child tax benefit and no increase at all in pensions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Recent funding opportunities that were given to the  community and voluntary sector in Britain have not been offered here,  and we need to point continually to the years of underinvestment and the fact  that we are coming out of conflict. It was my understanding that we would be  able to retain both the efficiency savings for 2010-11 and the windfall tax of  &pound;40 million that came to the North as a result of the fuel price increase last  year to deal with front line services, but all efficiency savings will now go  directly to the British Treasury instead of being distributed here. That points  to the need for the Assembly to have greater fiscal powers. Previously, Sinn  F&eacute;in tabled a motion on that issue, and it was supported by all parties, except  the unionist parties.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the past, I have heard a number of Members call for a  bit of creativity in dealing with the block grant, but that has not been taken  on board. My colleague Mitchel McLaughlin is one who has constantly argued that  we need to look at different ways of distributing the resources that are  available.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We also need to look at the economy on an all-island basis.  It does not make sense that there are two health services and two education  services.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  No, I will not.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is duplication throughout this island, which impacts  on efficiency levels and the economy as a whole. Investment companies must be  looked at on an all-island basis that focuses on need, and not in a competitive  North/South way, as is currently the case. We need to locate businesses in  areas of high unemployment and social and economic disadvantage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although foreign investment is welcome given the recession,  we need to secure jobs that are already here and grow and develop local  businesses. Those are the ones that stay, while larger foreign businesses will  leave if they get cheaper labour elsewhere. Visteon is one of plenty of  examples of that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Over two thirds of all businesses on the island have stated  that there should be more cross-border co-operation. It is clear that that  would have a positive impact on business when one considers that over &euro;6  billion is spent each year on public procurement of works, services and goods,  and most of it goes to overseas companies.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">By incorporating social clauses into procurement contracts,  the Assembly can ensure that businesses are compelled to employ the long-term  unemployed; to create quality apprenticeships for young people, especially  those who have underachieved at school; and to locate in areas of social and  economic disadvantage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It does not make sense for this island&rsquo;s small population  to have two totally different economic systems. As for the amendment, it is a  bit of a nonsense to set up a subcommittee that would be in direct conflict  with the Finance Committee, which, after all, scrutinises all aspects of work  that is brought forward, including the Budget. I support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  I commend my two party colleagues for proposing this important motion. Members  will come to their own conclusions about the purpose behind the Ulster Unionist  Party&rsquo;s amendment. I am sure that being tied to a party at Westminster that will introduce drastic  spending cuts leaves the Ulster Unionists feeling a bit uncomfortable in the  House. On the one hand, they accept that the Assembly should oppose any  reduction while, on the other hand, they bring out a white flag and admit  defeat.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am glad that the amendment&rsquo;s proposers are not  negotiating with the Treasury. Members are aware of the Ulster Unionist Party&rsquo;s  track record in negotiating. In general, it does not fill us with great  confidence. I cannot see the point in the establishment of any more Committees.  Perfectly adequate arrangements are already in place in the Executive and the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In proposing the motion, the DUP is only too aware that the  nation and the Province face unprecedented challenges. There is no doubt that  since the Executive agreed their three-year Budget in autumn 2007, the economic  and financial climate has changed almost beyond recognition. The developed  world faces pressures on a challenging scale. Difficult decisions will have to  be made after the general election; there will be no running away from them.  Challenging times demand strong and courageous leadership. I have no doubt that  the Finance Minister, in common with his predecessors, possesses those  qualities in abundance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Notwithstanding the pressures that I have described, I  remain convinced that the Programme for Government and the Budget that  underpins it are the best foundation on which to build, despite what the  doom-and-gloom merchants in the House would have Members believe. Indeed, the  leader of the Ulster Unionist Party is on public record as having accepted that  to be the case.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Yes, there are serious pressures, some of which were  predicted and others totally unforeseen. However, unlike what happened recently  in Cromac Street,  there is no hole. That is because Northern Ireland&rsquo;s finances have  been carefully controlled throughout the deteriorating economic climate, not  only by the Finance Minister but by the Executive through their quarterly  monitoring process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the then Finance Minister, Nigel Dodds, said in April:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the Executive will need to have an even greater focus  on ensuring that every pound spent on public services delivers maximum value  for money&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Demanding efficiency targets have been set for all  Departments. However, more can and must be done, because Northern Ireland  depends too heavily on the public sector. The Assembly needs to reduce government  by cutting the number of Departments and quangos. The cost of government  administration and bureaucracy is far too high. The Assembly needs to create  wealth by pursuing its economic agenda and by encouraging innovation and  productivity.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The required shift away from the public sector to the  private sector will not happen overnight. In the medium term, and possibly for  longer, Northern Ireland  will continue to suffer from poverty, unemployment and economic deprivation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When devolved arrangements were restored in May 2007,  Members knew that much work needed to be done. The economy and society in  general had suffered many years of direct rule neglect and the impact of  decades of terrorism, which tore the very heart out of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  economy and destroyed its infrastructure. Prior to devolution, the former First  Minister Dr Paisley pointed out that the train could not leave the station  unless it was properly fuelled.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We left the station two years ago, and we are on our  journey. If we are not to be derailed or to grind to a halt, it is imperative  that we are properly fuelled, and we must do everything possible to ensure that  Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  share of the block grant is not cut. It will be a tough battle, and highwaymen  who are lurking in the shadows are determined to rob the train at some point.  Some are dressed in the red of Labour, and they will bide their time. Others,  even more vicious, are dressed in the Tory blue, and they are poised to strike.  Let us face it, if the Conservative Party &mdash; the bosom buddies of the Ulster  Unionist Party &mdash; win the next general election, we will not only be robbed, we  will be lynched by its proposed cuts. Then there will be a black hole, which,  in reality, will be more like a bottomless pit that will spell disaster for Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.15pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Bring your remarks to a close, please.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  That is why the House needs to support the motion and oppose the amendment.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  The Minister of Finance and Personnel has said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;we know that after the next Westminster election whatever the outcome,  our budget could be reduced by up to 10%. We must prepare for that by looking  at what spending changes can be made, and what needs to be done to implement  them.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Therefore, unlike his colleague Tom Buchanan, who  thinks that there is going to be a lynching and that people are poised to  strike and take away all the money, the Minister obviously accepts that our  share will be cut, whatever the outcome of the general election. When the train  that Mr Buchanan spoke about left, it was not properly fuelled. That has been  one of the Assembly&rsquo;s problems from the outset.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Interestingly, when speaking to the Institute of Bankers  about the need for Executive action in the face of the fiscal crisis, the First  Minister, the Rt Hon Peter Robinson, said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;There are leaders who believe they will be better  thought of if they never ask people to do anything hard even if every enquiry  to logic leads to the need for such a call to be made. Politicians often  underestimate the public&rsquo;s willingness to do the right thing when it clear what  the right thing is and what its benefits are and what the true cost of the  alternatives really is.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion is the lowest form of cheap electioneering that  I have seen for quite some time, and I am surprised that the powers within the  DUP allowed it to be tabled. The motion is dangerous because it says to the  people of Northern Ireland  that there is a way of opting out of the Labour Government&rsquo;s mess and that we  can be excluded.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am sorry, but that is the type of irresponsible message  that I expect to hear from Sinn F&eacute;in or perhaps from the DUP&rsquo;s friends in the  Scottish National Party, but not from fellow unionists. As a unionist, I  believe in the UK, and I  believe that we should be at the heart of the Union.  For more than 200 years, we have reaped the benefits of being in the Union, and we cannot shirk our responsibilities now.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the same speech that I quoted from, Peter Robinson  correctly stated that, internationally, the approach that Governments have  taken has been to stimulate demand with higher public expenditure. Public  expenditure in the UK  has been based almost exclusively on public debt. As the leader of the  Opposition pointed out in today&rsquo;s &lsquo;The Times&rsquo;, next year, Britain is expected  to borrow almost 14% of its national income, and that is twice as much as it  borrowed when it almost went bust in the 1970s.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That is why Sammy Wilson and Peter Robinson recognise, like  every other political party in the UK and every economic expert, that  we must reduce public spending to secure our long-term future. It is wrong to  say that this is a case of parties of cuts versus parties of investment. It is  a case of harsh reality, which has been brought on by the Labour Government&rsquo;s  mismanagement of the nation&rsquo;s public finances.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Is it only Simon Hamilton and the DUP outcast Gregory  Campbell who do not recognise that reality? They may have to join Jeffrey  Donaldson on the party&rsquo;s naughty step this week. They should grab the amendment  with both hands and use it as a way out of the original motion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Leaving the DUP&rsquo;s schoolroom politics aside, the amendment  also gives us a real opportunity to prepare for the next CSR period. For too  long, DUP Finance Ministers have refused to recognise the home-grown black hole  in the public finances, which now means that we must find &pound;370 million worth of  cuts by Christmas. We cannot let that happen again.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Across the UK,  devolved Governments and local authorities are reprioritising in preparation  for the circumstances that have been created by Gordon Brown&rsquo;s mismanagement.  We must do the same, and the unique nature of our political system means that  we need as much time as possible to get the necessary agreement. An ad hoc  budgetary review Committee is one of the best options to get that agreement,  and I hope that the amendment will be supported by all parties in the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The First Minister is right.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member draw his remarks to a close, please?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  The public are not stupid, but unfortunately the DUP have treated them with  contempt, and that is regrettable.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  Like Declan O&rsquo;Loan, I support the motion. I accept that it is probably the  lowest common denominator on the issue, as some of the Ulster Unionist members  said, but it is an important common denominator if we are to declare our  opposition to any reduction in the Northern Ireland block grant during  the next CSR period, or whatever it might be called.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP has a problem with the Ulster Unionist Party&rsquo;s  amendment because, as other Members pointed out, a motion that begins by saying  that the Assembly is opposed to any reduction in the block grant and then says  that the Assembly should prepare for a 10% reduction and plan how best to  manage that is not a robust declaration.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Just because Sammy Wilson says something in an interview in  the &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo; does not necessarily qualify that to be the stuff of a  solemn Assembly resolution on an issue as serious as public expenditure, which  underpins important public services and which will, hopefully, underpin  economic growth. Every Sammy Wilson quotation is not chapter and verse on an  issue, and I do not think that that is justification for the text of the  amendment. As other Members indicated, the Ulster Unionist Party clearly has a  difficulty because of its relationship with the Tory Party, which has said that  there will be 10% cuts; and that is, essentially, where that figure has come  from.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Does the Member acknowledge that the SDLP has asked for a budgetary review  Committee to examine the difficulties that currently exist, never mind those  that may exist in the future? Does he also acknowledge that the amendment  simply says that the Assembly should make preparations for cuts of up to 10%?  We are not accepting any particular figure; we simply wish to be prepared for  the options.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  First, I happily acknowledge that the SDLP has advocated a budgetary review  Committee and still does, as Mr O&rsquo;Loan indicated earlier. We had tabled an  amendment to that effect, but we proposed a budgetary review Committee to deal  with the serious pressures on budgets, public expenditure and public services.  The Assembly should not wait until the next comprehensive spending review to  address those issues. It should be addressing them now.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We specified that a budgetary review Committee would look  at absorbing future cuts and protecting front line services. We suggested that  budget lines need to be recast in order to identify those that are wholly or  mainly front line services and those that are administrative and bureaucratic  overheads. By doing so, non-front line services could be targeted for  efficiency savings and investment could be made in front line services to  improve performance, effectiveness and delivery in those areas. That is what we  want a budgetary review Committee do.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We also it want to identify the most important spending  areas in order to support key sectors of the economy and growth during the period  of recovery that we hope will come, and to better manage the key strategic  investment that is being planned for the next few years. That will ensure that  we not only have a quality infrastructure and public service estate but that we  trap the multiplier and grow businesses here that can sell their expertise and  talent elsewhere.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We want a budgetary review Committee. Our amendment was not  accepted, but we will come back to that issue to give all parties an  opportunity to vote for a budgetary review Committee that sets out priorities  and which re-proofs and re-profiles the Budget in that way will lay the  groundwork to absorb whatever emerges in the next comprehensive spending  review. Whether we end up with more money, the same money, or less money, the work  of a budgetary review Committee would inform how best we plan for and use those  moneys.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Frankly, one reason why we want a budgetary review  Committee is because it is not within the competence of the Committee for  Finance and Personnel to review the Budget in that way. That is partly because  even the Department of Finance and Personnel does not do a full job in  comprehensively and actively &mdash; certainly not proactively &mdash; reviewing and  re-proofing the Budget. That is something that we, as an Assembly, need to do.  It is not right for us simply to dump that at the door of the Finance Minister  or on the table of the Executive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As we know, the Executive sometimes find it difficult to  handle Budget issues. In 2008, there was a Budget vote in the House, but there was  no Budget process last year because the Executive found it difficult and wanted  to avoid the Chamber. We do not know what will happen in the next financial  year: will we have a Budget statement or will we not?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those are issues that we need to grapple with. If we want  to be taken seriously as a regional legislature, we need to be on top of those  issues. All parties have to play their part.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP wants to play its part. We do not want to dump  budgetary issues on other parties and say that it is up to them and that  everything is their fault.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member bring his remarks to a close please?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  We want to play our part in making responsible choices and in carving out clear  strategic priorities in as positive a way as possible. To that end, we support  the motion and oppose the amendment.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  We will come back with our own proposals.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I call Mr Alex Attwood. He has three minutes only. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Alex Attwood</strong>:  I have three points to make, and I will make them very quickly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Gregory Campbell said that, over the next five to 10 years,  he wanted support for indigenous businesses and the indigenous economy. He is  right.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Recently, I spoke to somebody who plays a strategic role in  an economic development agency in the North; I will share the name of that  person privately with the Minister after the debate. He said something that  surprised me. He said that we have only 10 years to get the economic  relationship between Dublin and Belfast  and the island strategy right, and that if we do not get it right within the  next 10 years, Dublin and Belfast  will lose out, with Belfast  losing out the most.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If we are to address our future Budgets and our future  budgetary needs, the Minister must heed and hear what that senior strategic  economic thinker is saying about how little time we have to get things joined  up.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When it comes to the Minister, I do not think that I am  necessarily knocking on a closed door. When it comes to his relationships in Dublin around NAMA, and  his conversation with the Finance Minister in the South, the Minister has  indicated a level of independence and has shown a little bit of fresh thinking  that goes beyond the political orthodoxy that normally prevails in the Chamber  and between the political parties in the North.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To avoid the North and the South losing out, I encourage  the Minister to speak to that economic thinker &mdash; whose name I will give him  after the debate &mdash; to understand why he says that time is so short.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome Mitchel McLaughlin&rsquo;s rather independent speech,  which, again, was outside the usual political orthodoxy that prevails in the  Chamber. He said that we need to put in place a firm budgetary process, well in  advance of the 2010 CSR, in the summer or autumn of next year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member then, for want of a better term, rounded on the  DFP for not coming forward to the Assembly in respect of commitments made by  the former Finance Minister on the review of the in-year monitoring round  process, the budgetary process, and in anticipation of the consequences of the  House of Lords recent needs-based approach.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Given that that was an independent approach that I have not  seen from its ranks in recent times, Sinn F&eacute;in should adopt the position of Mr  Durkan and Mr O&rsquo;Loan in the debate. Instead of the narrow-fit approach outlined  in the UUP amendment, Sinn F&eacute;in should adopt the much more rounded review  approach that the SDLP previously outlined on how we should deal with our  budgetary processes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Time is short, and need is great. We need to cut through  what has passed for economic debate in the Chamber &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to bring his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  That should be done by adopting the SDLP approach to the detailed working  through of budgetary needs.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr S Wilson)</strong>: The debate has been useful and has,  for the most part, been injected with an air of realism about the economic  situation in which we find ourselves. I want to make it very clear that my  remarks are not to be interpreted as those of someone who wants to behave like  a fiscal King Canute who will deny where the tide of public finance is coming  from and going to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We know about the difficult economic situation in which the  United Kingdom  finds itself. We know about the economic situation in which the Irish Republic  finds itself, which has an impact on our economy, as mentioned by Mr Attwood.  We also know about the global economic situation. There are certain realities  that we must face.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to spell out the economic situation &mdash; the reality,  as I see it. Having said that, I urge the Assembly to examine the defeatist  attitude of the party that tabled the amendment, the totally inaccurate picture  that it painted and the weakness of the solution that it suggests.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We know that there are difficult economic times ahead.  These are difficult economic times. Many of the Budget assumptions on which we  were working for the next three years have been affected by the recession. Many  people said that there should have been a review of the Budget. We have  reviewed the Budget. We have reviewed it constantly through monitoring rounds.  I refer to some of our actions on rates; the speed with which we have brought  forward some public-spending projects; our front-loading of some investment;  and the type of investment projects that we have afforded greater priority. We  have done all of that within the limits available to us.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Going forward, we know that there are levels of debt in the  United Kingdom  that will have to be addressed and that borrowing as a percentage of GDP is far  too high. The issue is how quickly we try to reduce that debt and the borrowing  requirement. We also know that there are revenue consequences from the current  economic situation, such as higher interest payments and higher payments to  support the unemployed. Those are a drain on the available money.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That is the background against which we have to view the  current situation. However, I know that we will not address that issue through  a motion. Some Members have suggested that the amendment is an attempt by the  party that proposed it, which has allied itself to the Conservatives, to  support cuts because the Conservatives have said that there will be fairly  draconian cuts in the future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The party that tabled the amendment produced a 10- or  12-page document on the current recession. I read that document meticulously,  and one would have thought that there would be five or six ideas in its 10  pages. However, the only idea was to set up another committee. That is that  party&rsquo;s brilliant answer to the current situation. Of course, that party has  got it wrong in many other ways. It claims that the DUP is engaging in  political opportunism and says that we need to think seriously about the  matter, stop beating our chests &mdash; I think that that was the term that was used  &mdash; stop the rhetoric and get on with the job. That message has not reached the  Health Minister, who is not in the Chamber. At the first whiff of potentially  difficult decisions, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions held a protest. Who  doffed his cloth cap, put his socialist mantle around his shoulders and  attended that rally?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Comrade McGimpsey.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: That is right: none other than Comrade McGimpsey.  Before the party that proposed the amendment talks about chest beating,  rhetoric and the need to address these issues seriously, it should perhaps put  that message across to one of its most senior members, who will have to make  some difficult decisions in the Executive. Ultimately, a budget review  committee or the Committee for Finance and Personnel will not make those  decisions: they will be made in the Executive and will come to the Assembly for  approval.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The party that proposed the amendment outlined the size of  the problem. Its Members asked how we can possibly manage a situation down the  line if we cannot manage the current situation. They talked about the size of  the block grant, and Mr Farry from North Down said that there will be big  problems when the &pound;4 billion block grant is cut. One would imagine that, when  Members were carrying out research for the motion, they would have got the size  of the block grant right. It is not &pound;4 billion; it is &pound;9&middot;8 billion, and half of  it goes to the Minister of Health, who says that he cannot and will not cut a  penny. He will march down the street with the red flag rather than consider  structural reforms in a budget that takes up half of our allocated money.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The party at the end of the Chamber talked about black  holes. I was surprised that Mr McNarry took so long to mention black holes  during his speech. We are always subject to such exaggeration and ignorant  comments. There is a pressure of &pound;370 million, not as a result of mismanagement,  but as a result of the decisions that the two Ministers from the Ulster  Unionist Party made collectively in the Executive on water charges, help for  small businesses and so on. Those decisions carry a price tag that we must now  address. There may be a pothole, but there is no black hole. That pothole was  caused by decisions that we, as adults, took, and we knew what the consequences  of those decisions were. What needs to be done? I do not want to dwell too much  on what I believe to be a face-saving exercise on the part of the Ulster  Unionist Party, which is under some pressure from its Conservative masters not  to be seen to be identified too closely with the intent of the motion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">First, from experience, it is clear that, when we have  faced pressures, we have been able to negotiate successfully. That means, of  course, that we had to have prepared a case. I have no difficulty with the  collective work of the Assembly, the Executive and departmental officials in  preparing such a case. However, let us examine the successes so far. Much of  what has been achieved in the Assembly was delivered by the cash that was  received in the devolution settlement. We used much of that &pound;1,000 million to  do many of the good things that we have been able to do.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We knew that pressures were coming, such as the equal pay  claim. I hope to resolve that issue fairly quickly, and I am sure that that  will please the Member for North Antrim Mr O&rsquo;Loan, who pestered me about it on  several occasions. When that issue arose, we successfully negotiated  flexibility from the Assembly to deal with that and other pressures. Only  recently, against a backdrop of huge financial constraints, has it been  possible to negotiate a considerable amount of additional money for the  devolution of policing and justice powers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that my introductory remarks showed that I am  realistic about the situation, but I want to emphasise that we should never  throw in the towel. If we had done that on policing and justice &mdash; there were  Members on the opposite Benches who would have had us conclude the discussions  much earlier than we did &mdash; we would have lost out on substantial additional  funding. The Government have made commitments to provide &pound;18 billion over 10  years for the investment strategy. We must make the case again that that money  should not be touched because it was part of the devolution settlement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members talked about making a case to the Treasury. In  the light of the negotiations that I am having with Ministers and the decisions  that the Executive will have to make eventually, the case that we make to the  Treasury for holding to the amount of money that comes to Northern Ireland  must show that we can use the available funding effectively. That is why the  outcome of the negotiations on the efficiencies that we have to consider for  next year &mdash; &pound;370 million or whatever the amount turns out to be &mdash; is important.  We must show that we can deal responsibly with that pressure.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member for North Down Dr Farry made a good point: if we  are to examine our public spending, we must ensure that, first, it is spent  efficiently and effectively and is designed to change the structure of our  economy so that it becomes more sustainable. Secondly, we must be able to say  that the money is needed to change our economy, and, when we are given it for  that purpose, we must use it for that purpose. Otherwise, it becomes much more  difficult to negotiate with the Treasury. Thirdly, the debate about the  Programme for Government and the structure of the Budget is important. That is  why, in the longer term, we must look to elements of spending that lead to  structural change in our economy and make us less dependent on public funding.  As long as we depend on the whim of a Government for the vast majority of our  GDP, we will be vulnerable, because Governments face various difficulties as  political waves come and go. That is one reason why we need structural change.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate the points that Members made in the debate.  There has been an air of realism and recognition that we must not approach the  debate lying down, waving a white flag and saying that we doubt that we can  succeed. We must at least make our case.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Minister to draw his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: We have to be realistic about the circumstances that  we face. The Assembly must ensure that it makes the best use of money by  spending it responsibly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: My  colleague David McNarry rightly posed the question of how double-jobbing MLAs  and Ministers will protect Northern    Ireland from potential cuts in the block  grant. Double-jobbing restricts their time in and influence on Westminster, and that is where the decisions  are made. It is much easier simply to wait for results before taking a step  back and criticising the Government, whether it is new Labour or Conservative,  and they appear to be following that practice.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Given the unprecedented borrowing by the Labour Government,  significant reductions in public spending in the UK are inevitable. The UK&rsquo;s national  debt is at its highest level since the Second World War. Some nationalist  colleagues think that we can get more money from Westminster. They should consider what  happened down South, where the situation is even worse. In dealing with a  household or government budget, all borrowed money must be repaid with  interest. Those basic principles should be followed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is regrettable that the Labour Government, who have a  track record of financial failures, were propped up by DUP MPs when they could  have collapsed. It has placed a burden on future generations and  Administrations to spend more on interest repayments than on their entire  education budgets. The DUP failed to advise us how that borrowing is to be  repaid.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Last week, Mr Weir and I visited Scotland with the Northern Ireland  Local Government Association (NILGA). We visited councils in Renfrewshire and North Lanarkshire. Although both are in areas of need,  the councils told us of their plans to reduce costs by at least 10% over the  next four to five years. We cannot realistically expect such cuts in  expenditure to be imposed on areas in Scotland,  England and Wales while Northern Ireland remains completely  unaffected. Some of the required efficiencies will fall to us. We will fight to  minimise any cuts in expenditure and their effect on our constituents, but it  is unrealistic to say that there will be no change. As my colleague rightly  pointed out, the change is already happening.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Conservatives, using the Labour Government&rsquo;s figures,  illustrated that 10% cuts were on the way, yet Gordon Brown failed to  acknowledge that for some time; in fact, he appeared to deny it. The Liberal  Democrats&rsquo; Treasury spokesman, Vince Cable, told the BBC:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I think we all realised, who have studied government  documents, that cuts were on the way&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">He went on to say that it is only a matter of  &ldquo;when, how and where&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Sammy Wilson, our Minister of Finance and Personnel, wrote  in the &lsquo;News Letter&rsquo; on 12 October:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;we know that after the next Westminster election &mdash; whatever the outcome &mdash;  our budget could be reduced by up to10 per cent.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">My question to Gregory Campbell &mdash; I note that he is  not in his place &mdash; is whether he thinks that his Minister is defeatist. I ask  the DUP to reflect on the language of our amendment, because it is exactly the  same as that used by its Minister of Finance and Personnel. A point that some  in the DUP missed is that, by attacking us, they are also attacking their  Minister. The leader of the DUP, Peter Robinson, addressing the Institute of Bankers&rsquo;  annual dinner in Belfast,  said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;we could have significant challenges ahead as UK public  expenditure cuts come after the next General Election. This will be a reality  whatever the outcome of the election and we must be prepared for it.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I ask Gregory Campbell and his DUP colleagues, &ldquo;Is  your First Minister defeatist?&rdquo;. You are denying what he and the Finance  Minister have clearly expressed and what we have expressed in the amendment.  Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat representatives and indeed the DUP  Finance Minister and the DUP First Minister have acknowledged that financial  difficulties lie ahead. It is unrealistic to think that nothing will fall on Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Other parties have made suggestions. However, Sinn F&eacute;in  supports its DUP partners, keeps its head in the sand and gets more money from Westminster. It is not  even prepared to go to Westminster  to argue its case. Declan O&rsquo;Loan suggested that the Barnett formula be  reviewed, but many needy parts of Scotland also face difficulty. The  Barnett formula may help us or it may not, but there is no guarantee that it  will be our salvation. Stephen Farry of the Alliance Party seems willing to  accept tax increases as a solution. However, we must remember that increasing  tax too much destroys jobs. We must take care.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to draw his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  urge Members to take the step now. Support the amendment, rather than face  last-minute firefighting and, potentially, wasting limited public resources.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I thank everyone for their contributions to the debate, which has been  valuable. The motion tabled by Mr Campbell and me is a simple and  straightforward attempt to seek the Assembly&rsquo;s support in stating our  opposition to any cuts in the block grant in the next CSR or whatever it is  called at that time. The reasons why one would oppose a cut in the block grant  are so obvious that it would be easy to rest the case there, but I accept the  Finance Minister&rsquo;s point that we must state our case further. We need to say  why Northern Ireland should not face the savage 10% cuts that it is mooted will  be made by a Labour or Tory Administration.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is worth pointing out that the Assembly and the  Executive have made cases with some success in recent times. Indeed, even  before devolution, the case for a financial package was made successfully. That  package has allowed us to make a substantial investment in Northern Ireland  in the past two years. The Finance Minister pointed out how &pound;100 million of  borrowings can be accessed to help with the equal pay claim and other  pressures. Some &pound;800 million was secured in respect of the non-cash impacts of  water charges. In recent weeks and months, the case has been well made for a  proper financial package for policing and justice, if and when those are  devolved.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We must begin to construct our case as to why Northern Ireland  should not face the savage cuts that are being talked about, and we can put  forward several arguments. The first is one that does not come naturally to me;  indeed, I am not always comfortable with putting it forward. I refer to the  special case argument. Northern    Ireland is seen by some as always making a  special plea. However, the fact is that we are different to every other region  of the United Kingdom,  not least because of the 35-plus years of civil strife from which we are still  struggling to emerge. The special case argument has been made before and,  indeed, was an aspect of the cases I have mentioned. I made the special case  argument for the reduction in corporation tax, which everyone supported. Other parties,  including the Ulster Unionist Party, have sought to make the special case  argument in the proposal for an enterprise zone for Northern Ireland, for example. We  are not unaccustomed to making the special case argument. The 35 years of the  Troubles have had a very negative impact on many things in Northern Ireland,  including our social and economic fabric.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Consideration of all sorts of headline indicators and  socio-economic measures shows the distinct difference between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom  and how we will remain a special case for the foreseeable future. Take the  figures on child poverty or fuel poverty, for example. It is estimated that 34%  of people in Northern Ireland  live in fuel poverty compared to around 12% in England. A report published by the  Joseph Rowntree Foundation last week indicated that, in many areas of Northern  Ireland, poverty is double that in the rest of the United Kingdom. We have a  higher dependence on benefits. Our income levels are lower.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Health Minister talks about health inequalities when he  regularly complains about his resources. He uses the argument that health  inequalities are worse in Northern Ireland  than they are in the rest of the United Kingdom. If one accepts  that, and I do not think that exemptions can be made for any budget, how much  more moaning will Michael McGimpsey do if we face cuts of 10% that could be  administered by his new political masters in the Tory Party?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Economically, Northern   Ireland has faced many distinct disadvantages compared to  the rest of the United    Kingdom. Those are principally a result of  35 years of civil strife, during which inward investment was negatively  impacted. We had an underdeveloped tourist potential and lower investment in  research and development. There was underinvestment in our infrastructure,  which can be seen most clearly in the likes of our water and sewerage  infrastructure. As a balance to that, we have had the problem of the dominance  of the public sector in our economy. That is not to mention the more recent  economic impacts and the current slowdown. Places like Dungannon, Cookstown and  Magherafelt have experienced some of the highest increases in unemployment in  the whole of the United    Kingdom.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are trying to get to grips with all those problems. We  should all be able to see very clearly the negative impact that cuts of 10% or  more would have on our ability to get to grips with those issues. There is much  talk of a double-dip or W-shaped recession. Despite all the efforts that we  have made to weather the storm in Northern Ireland &mdash; efforts that have been  made by the private sector, the public sector and the third sector to position  ourselves for an upturn &mdash; we could be plunged into a longer and deeper  recession if there are 10% cuts because of the dominance of and our reliance on  the public sector.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is our desire to see Northern Ireland become more  self-reliant. It is our desire to see an end to the dominance of the public  sector and growth of the private sector. Is that aim helped or hindered by a  10% cut in the block grant? We argue that some help, assistance and  understanding now will help Northern    Ireland to be in a better position to better  pay its way and make a bigger contribution in the future. Taking that amount of  investment out of our economy now could have a serious detrimental effect and  set us back years, if not generations. There is also an argument about the  stability of devolution, which is very much dependent on having in place a  financial package. There is much talk about this place foundering on issues  such as policing and justice. Given the system that we have, whenever there are  pressures on budgets, there is greater risk to the stability of devolution than  there would be on account of anything else. Overall cuts of 10% would represent  a very severe pressure on our Budget.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is not that we are oblivious to the need for greater  efficiencies. We should all strive for those as a matter of course. It is about  looking at dismantling the ugly scaffolding at Stormont and looking at  different ways of doing the same things. I am currently very interested in the  likes of alternative methods of financing for social housing, for example, and  leveraging in greater private finance. There is a real need to look at all our  policies and priorities to see whether programmes are achieving their aims or  whether they are achieving anything at all.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Caving in does not help our argument at all. The amendment  seems to accept rather than oppose any cut in the block grant. We should not  offer support for that either implicitly or explicitly, and we certainly should  not acquiesce. We should, plainly and simply, oppose any cut in the block  grant.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I suppose that I should not be bewildered by the position  of the Ulster Unionist Party. I would have thought that it must know that a 10%  cut in the block grant would have a devastating impact on our economy, people  and public services. The defeatism that it has exhibited today in its Members&rsquo;  speeches and its amendment is something that we have all come to expect over  the years. That is reflective of where the power lies in the political alliance  between the Ulster Unionist Party and the Conservative Party.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not know, and I do not think that anybody here knows,  what the value of the block grant will be in the next comprehensive spending  review (CSR) period. However, it is clear that, if a consequence of the  alliance between the UUP and the Conservative Party is that we have to roll  over and acquiesce in accepting a 10% cut in our block grant, that alliance is  of no value to the people of Northern    Ireland.</p>

    <p class="B3BodyText">It is curious, to say the least, to hear people on the  Ulster Unionist Benches describe the motion as &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo;. It is strange to  adopt the position that it is dangerous to oppose savage cuts in our block  grant. My DUP colleagues and I will unashamedly stand up for Northern Ireland.  We will unashamedly stand up for the interests of our people, economy and  public services. The people of Northern    Ireland should remember long and well those  who equivocate on cuts to our block grant and are tethered at the hip to those  who would administer those cuts.</p>

    <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30  minutes for the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes in  which to propose and 10 minutes in which to make a winding-up speech. One  amendment has been selected and published on the Marshalled List. The proposer  of the amendment will have 10 minutes in which to propose and five minutes in  which to make a winding-up speech. All other speakers will have five minutes in  which to speak.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes that many of our smaller schools are  under the viability quota proposed in the Department of Education sustainable  schools policy; and calls on the Minister of Education to enact suitable pilot  projects to develop ways of maintaining the viability of our smaller schools.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">T&aacute; an-&aacute;thas orm an r&uacute;n seo a mholadh. I am delighted to  move the motion. Of all the civic institutions that we have in the countryside,  the school serves the youngest constituency. The capacity to maintain a school  is a continuing indicator of a community&rsquo;s future well-being. Many rural  schools are not only the social hub of their community; they contribute to  their community&rsquo;s sense of survival. It is timely that we examine the issue of  rural schools before we embark on the area-based planning process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As well as being seats of learning, schools are places for  community activity: sports, drama, music and other civic events. The local  school is the place where generations come together and where community  identity and lifelong friendships are forged. To close a rural school is to  destroy an institution that holds the rural community together; to deal a body  blow to communities with the least resources in the smallest and most isolated  areas. Closure also damages the social and economic well-being of a community.  There is a fierce pride in the local school, and communities are loath to lose  them. A community will fight tooth and nail for its school&rsquo;s survival.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to focus on small rural primary schools. My colleagues  will deal with the issue of post-primary rural schools. Just under half of the  North&rsquo;s primary schools have fewer pupils than the minimum enrolment required  under the sustainable schools policy for small rural schools.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many smaller schools, whether controlled, maintained or  other management types, face huge challenges and major changes. The statistics  illustrate the magnitude of the problem. In the controlled sector, 130 primary  schools out of 340 have fewer than 105 pupils, and in the maintained sector,  153 out of 341 primary schools have fewer than 105 pupils. All in all, 304 out  of 735 primary schools are below the quota.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Education tells us that existing small  schools may work together to meet need. One way to do so is through federation,  which is an arrangement whereby small schools on separate sites come together  to form a single school. In the context of maintaining smaller schools,  federation is worth exploring. It may be a viable solution in defined areas.  Federation involves two or more primary schools working together under a single  board of governors and principal, and it is one way of helping to ensure the  future viability of small schools. I think that it makes good sense.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The most attractive form of federation can help to keep  pupils enrolled and taught in their home school, and that is preferable to  running a split-site model with Key Stage 1 pupils on one site and Key Stage 2  pupils on the other. Rather than smaller schools having to compete with each  other for survival, federation offers two or more smaller schools in an area  the opportunity to avoid closure through coexistence and co-operation, and  combined enrolments offer the chance to realise the prospect of accessing  future capital funding.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the fact that federation has been tried in some  areas and that it may offer a solution in other areas. In the North, it is a  relatively new concept, but it has worked successfully in other parts of Britain for  some years. I realise that if federation is to work it must first address the  education issues, which means having at least three teachers in each school,  due to the three stages of primary education. In addition, it must be  economically efficient. In many cases, federation can help two or more smaller  schools to meet the sustainability criteria that are outlined in the  sustainable schools policy: a quality educational experience; stable enrolment  trends; a sound financial position; strong leadership and management;  accessibility; and strong links with the community.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Rather than rushing to amalgamation or closure as a means  of managing the schools estate, is it not better, in order to ensure that every  possible opportunity is given to smaller schools to survive, to fully explore  the federation option? In the past five years, only two proposals for  federation have been considered by the Department, which is hardly surprising  given that the concept is relatively new here and that little work has been  done to support its development.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I believe that the time is right to explore the  possibilities of federation for sustaining small schools. A pilot scheme is  needed to explore what, if any, additional resources would be required to run  federations and whether or not that could be balanced against a range of other  issues, including the cost of travel time to children. For example, through  federation, senior management can be reduced: one principal for two or three  schools, with vice-principals or senior teachers managing individual sites. An  additional resource could be generated by each school&rsquo;s retaining its small  school allowance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am glad to see the Minister here, and I ask her to  seriously consider providing the resources that are necessary to run a number  of pilot schemes to fully explore the possibilities of federation, so that we  might develop a robust model to act as a template for education providers as  they consider the primary school estate in the context of area-based planning.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I turn to the Alliance Party&rsquo;s amendment. It is not  necessary to amend the motion, which is broad and wide enough to encompass what  the Alliance  amendment proposes. Our motion does not preclude cross-sectoral projects  involving combinations of integrated, maintained, controlled or Irish-medium  schools, although such combinations would depend on local circumstances. For  that reason, we are happy to support the Alliance  amendment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This issue affects Members&rsquo; constituencies, especially for  those who represent rural areas. Almost every MLA from a rural constituency  will be confronted by this problem. It is time that we address this problem in  a way that protects the rural communities. I propose not that schools which do  not meet the educational criteria for sustainability should be allowed to  continue, but that schools that can work together in viable federations should  be allowed the opportunity to do so.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Lunn</strong>: I  beg to move the following amendment: At end insert</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;; and in particular to fully explore the potential  for integrated schools or other versions of shared education as the most  realistic means to preserve local education in many rural communities.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have no problem with the SDLP motion, which we consider  timely and relevant. We hope that the Minister will take note of the call to  develop ways of ensuring the viability of our rural school network. Like  Dominic Bradley, I am mainly concerned about the situation of primary schools.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The purpose of my party&rsquo;s amendment is to highlight one of  the more obvious solutions, which is to consider integrated education in  certain situations and the broad principle of shared education in general. The  sustainable schools policy document is fair and realistic. There is no dispute  about the statistical data cited or the demographic trends. The problem is how  to deal with the situation which arises when the enrolment numbers decline  below the minimum level and with the contrasting demands of financial  sustainability, the quality and breadth of the education provided and the  upkeep cost of the school estate, as against the contribution of the school to  community cohesion and historical and emotional links to that community, which  Dominic Bradley has so ably and eloquently stressed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The policy makes various references that appear to counter  the argument that only enrolment numbers are relevant. For instance, it  highlights the need to:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;uphold an education system that plays a powerful and  positive role in the normalising of society, helping to make it sustainable and  vibrant, with greater sharing amongst communities.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I will return to that quotation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The policy also encourages schools to become more  integrated into the wider community, including by providing informal education  opportunities beyond the school. Again, that is to do with the role of the  school as the hub of the community, which Dominic referred to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That vision statement leads me to the amendment, which  seeks to ask the Minister to include the potential of shared education across  the traditional sectors and the integration of schools in areas where it is the  most viable option. The provision of a new integrated school may in some  situations be appropriate, but I prefer the coming together in a single  institution of controlled and maintained schools, and the sharing of  facilities, staff, premises and anything else to ensure the viability of local  schooling arrangements.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many rural schools are recognised as essential components  in the life of their areas. We have to recognise that, in some situations,  closure is unavoidable. In Lagan Valley, in recent years, we have had the  painful experience of watching five small primary schools, all within a mile or  two of each other, close down, at Drumbeg, Hilden, Drumbo, Hillhall and Lambeg.  It is unfortunate, but as is the case with banks, post offices and the local  shop, some schools simply do not have enough customers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Our amendment emphasises the point made in the motion:  although the viability quota is extremely important, it need not be the point  on which a school falls, and every available option, however radical, should be  explored in a local situation to preserve a valued local resource.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">6.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I refer again to the vision statement and the powerful and  positive role that a small school can play in the normalising of society and in  encouraging greater sharing among communities. What could be more normal or  play a greater part in normalisation than the bringing together of our children  in schools for their education? We can talk about integrated or shared  education, or we can call it whatever we want, but we have 50,000 empty desks,  and that number is increasing. Small schools across the Province are making  contributions to their local communities, but they are threatened with closure.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If the various authorities can bring some fresh thinking to  the problem, I believe that it can be solved. I know that the Minister keeps an  open mind about the establishment of new integrated schools, and, as the policy  develops and attitudes soften, I hope that she will engage positively with the  terms of the motion to install pilot projects and, as proposed in our amendment,  explore the potential solutions offered by the integrated movement and other  shared education models. I urge Members to support the motion as amended.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education (Mr Storey)</strong>: First, I will speak in my  capacity as Chairperson of the Committee for Education. In July 2008, the  Committee provided the Department of Education with a substantive response to  the Department&rsquo;s policy paper on sustainable schools. Some of the issues and  concerns that were raised by the Committee, which the Minister of Education  responded to in December 2008 &mdash; before publishing her sustainable schools  policy in January 2009 &mdash; related to the viability of smaller schools. The point  was made that minimum enrolments are too high, and the final policy document  was strengthened in various parts. For instance, paragraph 1.11 of the  sustainable schools policy now reads:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The set of criteria set out in this document is much  broader than enrolment thresholds and are intended to provide a framework for  earlier consideration and action as necessary so that options can be considered  which best meet the educational needs of the local community.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It was suggested that the viability criteria for rural  primary schools be lowered to around 80 pupils, as opposed to 105. The response  highlighted that primary schools with a register of 80 pupils can be sustained  for the future, based on the needs of the local area, and a school  accessibility criterion has been included for rural schools.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee raised the point about two or more schools  working in federation, and Members will note that paragraph 6.13 of the policy  document includes federation in the list of main forms of working together to  address the need for sustainable schools. However, the policy document is  silent on how those would work in practice. For instance, how would school  funding arrangements work? That, and other practical arrange&shy;ments, needs to be  set out by the Department so that small schools know exactly what they can do  to be sustainable and continue to benefit their local community.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will also make some comments as a Member. We welcome the  opportunity to raise the issue of the future viability of rural schools, but  there is an elephant in the room, as there always is when it comes to this  issue. I challenge every Member, from any of the parties present, to face up to  a reality: there are too many schools. Here is another reality: very few of us  have the political courage to say that particular schools must be closed.  Although it is good for Dominic Bradley to say that we value our rural schools,  some sectors in the education system are all about the preservation of their  own sector at all costs, without any reference to anybody else. That is the  reason why we have the situation in which controlled primary schools have been  closing at a greater rate than maintained primary schools. That is no way to  deal with the situation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It worries me that the Department has a guru, Mr Weist. He  is a man of wisdom; he is one of the wise men &mdash; I am not sure whether he comes  from the west or the east. However, he comes from the United States  and has visited the Department on several occasions over the past number of  years. What has Mr Weist told us? He has told us that we have 900 schools,  whereas Montgomery County in Maryland,  where there is roughly the same number of pupils, has 125 schools. I was no  whizz-kid at school, but I know that Mr Weist is telling us that we have too  many schools, or as he described it to me when I met him, there are too many  cattle on one patch of ground. We must face that reality, but we should face it  with the caveat and bottom line that no sector should get an advantage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister made a statement to the House yesterday on  area planning in education. We must ensure that sectors are protected but that  no sector has an advantage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, a pilot scheme of school federations was run  in the Western Board area. However, several problems were identified. The board  indicated clearly that there were problems with the cost of running the scheme,  with agreeing location, with boards of governors and with administration. Given  that, I think that &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should bring his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Although the aspiration behind that scheme was admirable, we must give serious  consideration to the practical outworkings of such a proposal. Our rural  schools are at the heart of our rural communities, and they must be protected.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Given that I also represent a rural constituency, I am only  too aware of the significance that a rural school has for those who attend it  and for the wider community. As Dominic Bradley pointed out correctly, the  rural school is often the hub of the community. Rural schools are not just the  place where children are educated; they are often used as a meeting point and a  venue for community events. The closure of such schools has an impact not only  on the educational experience of the child, but on the community as a whole.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The wording of the motion emphasises the numbers element of  the sustainable schools policy. However, we cannot look at the issue as a  simple numbers game. The Department&rsquo;s policy sets out several other criteria  that must be considered when making decisions on a school&rsquo;s sustainability. We  should examine them. They are concerned with the quality of the educational  experience that is provided, and we obviously want our children to have the  best possible start and the best possible facilities to enable them to learn.  Those criteria also cover: stable enrolment trends; the sound financial  position of the school; strong leadership and management; and accessibility.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When the Assembly discussed rural schools previously, many  Members were aware of the fact that children are often bussed past their local  schools to go to schools outside their area. We must take a stand and encourage  people to send their children to local schools. The sixth criterion in the  Department&rsquo;s policy is the need for strong links with the community. As I said,  rural schools are at the heart of our communities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those criteria were developed after consultation with the  Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) and the Rural  Development Council, and I very much welcome the approach that the Department  took. I also commend the Department on all the decisions that it has made that  affect rural communities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, the reality is that there are smaller schools that  fear for their future and that feel very vulnerable at this time. We must use  this debate to send a clear message to the Executive that the Assembly is committed  to developing sustainable rural communities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said earlier, this is not just a numbers game. The  sustainable schools policy also refers clearly to providing a framework for the  early identification of emerging problems, with the possibility of taking  remedial action. That framework would not be used in a mechanistic fashion to  close schools; it is merely about tackling problems before schools reach the  irreversible position when rationalisation becomes the only answer. We must  tackle the problem before schools get to that stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Chairperson of the Committee for Education said,  there is no getting away from the fact that in a time of budgetary  restrictions, we must be realistic and deal with the fact that our school  population is declining. After all, we have 50,000 empty school desks. We must  also be more creative in our consideration of the long-term way forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion refers to using pilot schemes to explore the way  forward, and it is my understanding that the various school sectors are  implementing such pilot schemes already.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A Council for Catholic Maintained Schools (CCMS) review of  primary school provision in my area of Clonoe had a positive outcome, and  people were happy with that. We need to encourage more of that sort of work,  and we need to continue to be innovative and creative and to put the interests  of the child at the heart of all decisions. Dominic Bradley referred to  federation schools, and we need to examine such schools. They are a new  concept, but anything that protects smaller rural schools must be seriously  considered.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I thank the Members who tabled the motion for doing so. The Ulster Unionist  Party has consistently urged caution on the rationalisation of rural schools.  Local schools in rural areas play a vital role at the heart of local  communities, and to dismantle a local school is often to dismantle that local  community.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Rural Development Council&rsquo;s submission to the  independent strategic review of education stated that:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The support role of a school in rural areas,  particularly its capacity to contribute to social and community well-being and  broader social and economic goals&hellip;means that there should not be a substantial  time/distance gap between a school and households or communities within its  overall required catchment area.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The important fact to keep in mind is the disproportionate  impact that rural school closures will have on children from a more  disadvantaged background. That is precisely the conclusion of the Rural  Development Council, when it goes on to say:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Children from poorer backgrounds are  disproportionately affected by travel problems within rural areas. Such  children are more likely to be dependent upon the school bus for travel to and  from school, and therefore have difficulty in accessing both informal and  formal after-school hours activities.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionist Party raised its concerns about the  Minister&rsquo;s sustainable schools strategy when it was launched. Almost a year  into the strategy, that caution seems to have been warranted. The motion  correctly highlights that rural schools are at risk, and that is especially  true of rural primary schools. The motion correctly suggests that pilot  projects be used to develop options to save those schools.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Rural schools offer real benefits. Smaller class sizes  equals more attentive teachers, and being closer to home helps children to be  happier, secure and better behaved. That is why we must be innovative. The  Ulster Unionist Party has not been shy in making suggestions. My colleague  David McNarry still has on the back burner a private Member&rsquo;s Bill on community  use of schools and is waiting for the Minister to report back to him with her  proposals. We also tabled an amendment to the Education Bill to allow schools  to come together to form joint management schemes, giving them the potential to  share facilities and services to remain viable. I hope that the Minister  supports the amendment, because it is the type of thinking that we need and  that has been lacking in the Minister.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I noted the Minister&rsquo;s announcement on school entitlement.  The Minister claimed that that would now form part of her overall strategy.  However, I fail to see the consistency in the Minister&rsquo;s approach. On the one  hand, she is centralising education delivery in Northern   Ireland by creating the largest quango in Europe. She is also talking about choice and flexibility  and claims that every pupil must go to the nearest school. On the other hand,  however, she creates policies that will mean the closure of the nearest school  for many in rural localities. We will be able to make the sort of progress that  all Members want to see only when the Minister gives head teachers and boards  of governors genuine freedom to find local solutions to the real problems in  rural schools and elsewhere.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am somewhat sympathetic to the Alliance Party&rsquo;s  amendment. However, the party is wrong to prescribe a particular solution to  the problems of rural schools. Integrated education may not suit many  communities, and, with its reduced thresholds, it can often lead to extra  pressures on local schools.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">6.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: I  thank the Member for giving way. In what way does he think that the Alliance  Party is prescribing one solution, when its amendment calls on the Minister</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;to fully explore the potential &hellip; or other versions of  shared education&rdquo;?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">What is specific about that?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member has an extra minute.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Why then did the Alliance Party not word its amendment to read &ldquo;in other  sectors&rdquo;? The amendment is too narrow and too prescriptive; that is why the  Ulster Unionist Party has issues with it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We must give schools and communities the freedom to come up  with their own solution, and that is our argument for maintaining the viability  of our smaller schools. We will, of course, support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  congratulate the Members who tabled the motion. Northern Ireland has a large rural  population, and that must be borne in mind when making policies. On some of the  Committees that I have sat on, Members, particularly those opposite, talk  continually about rural-proofing policies, whether public transport or gritting  the roads. In the Committee for the Environment, we hear about the situation in  rural communities and how conditions affect them. There are differences in how  policies will play out in urban and rural areas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Nevertheless, the closure of schools, whether urban or  rural, is an emotive issue, and people automatically oppose such closures.  However, there is little doubt that the effect of closures is much greater in  rural areas. As has been said, the closure of schools can rip the heart out of  rural communities and oblige children to travel greater distances to find an  alternative school. The schools are more than just somewhere where children go  to learn; they are often the heart of a rural community, and many community groups  hold events in them. People in rural areas can come together in schools,  particularly in areas where there are isolated minority communities. It is  important that we recognise the role that schools play in rural areas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The viability of small schools must be judged on more than  enrolment figures. I know that Members have referred to that fact, but it is  important to mention it again. We must look at the role that schools play in an  area. However, as the Chairperson of the Committee said, we must face the fact  that it is not viable to have small schools all around the country when there  are so many empty desks. We must all face the fact that sometimes we must take  the tough decision to close a school. Nevertheless, just as it is not  sustainable to have empty desks, it is not sustainable to close down all  schools that do not meet the viability criteria; we must judge all schools on  their individual merits. The closure of more than 300 primary schools across  the country is something that no Member wants.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Innovative ideas are required and, to coin a phrase, we  need to think outside the box. The Member who proposed the motion was not  explicit about what he was talking about. My party discussed the federation  system in the past, and a system of having one principal over several schools  is worth examining. At the same time, I am aware that there were problems when  federation was piloted in the Western Board area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson referred to the difficulties with costs,  locations, boards of governors and timetabling. However, that should not put us  off the idea, although it highlights some of the difficulties that need to be  ironed out. Nonetheless, if the Assembly believes that federation could  safeguard some rural schools, it is worth considering, and it is a principle  that I endorse. That is not to say that rural schools should not close; some  closures are necessary. However, if federation can save schools, we should  support it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  have always been sceptical of fanciful terms such as sustainable schools, federations  and area planning; they are a cop-out when dealing with the number of schools.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Member agree that one of the fundamental issues  that must be dealt with is the need for genuine collaboration among rural  schools? Does he agree that they should not be allowed to have an advantage  either in their administrative arrangements or in the policies that they  implement that gives them an extra place at the table? There should be genuine  collaboration in rural communities, irrespective of the sector to which a  school belongs.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>:  That is absolutely right. As the Member mentioned earlier, in many cases,  unfortunately, there is a certain degree of self-preservation on such issues.  The Member is right to say that we need to have genuine collaboration among  rural schools.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To conclude, I will talk about the Alliance Party&rsquo;s  amendment. I note what the party is saying. When schools can work together,  that should be encouraged. However, specifically to propose integrated  education as a solution misses the point that there are empty desks in schools  right across the country. The proposal that the Alliance Party has made  consistently over the years, which is that we should have an additional sector  &mdash; the integrated sector &mdash; is ludicrous. If there are empty desks in  state-controlled schools, those desks should be filled, rather than have the Alliance Party harp on  about having an additional sector, which would compound the problem rather than  solve it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although I am content to support the original motion, I do  not think that I will support the amendment.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. A common theme is running through  the majority of contributions thus far, and that is that we need to support and  enhance our rural schools network. Some of the contributors to the debate may  have slightly different points of view as to how we go about that, but, if we  can agree on the broad theme, that is a good start.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The sustainable schools policy is not simply a numbers  game. It does what it says on the tin: creates a sustainable schools network  for rural and urban communities. There is a differential, even in the numbers,  for rural communities, recognising the unique pressures that rural communities  face and the uniqueness of rural community life.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">What is important about the sustainable schools policy is  that it offers informed early intervention in schools that may have falling  enrolment numbers and prevents them reaching a stage at which the first  attention that anybody pays to them is when rumours circulate about their  closure. That in itself is a death knell to many schools, because parents,  often rightly so, believe that their children&rsquo;s education is going to be  affected by a school that has falling enrolment numbers and may close within a  specific period.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The sustainable schools policy is about offering support to  schools in urban and rural communities &mdash; in this case, rural communities &mdash; and  ensuring that early intervention allows schools to maintain their numbers, to  consider alternatives, such as federated projects, which has been mentioned  today, and to look at how they can collaborate with their local community to  ensure that the school remains open. However, as has been mentioned, there will  be cases in which, despite the best efforts of all concerned &mdash; whether that be  the board, the CCMS or the Department &mdash; schools will close. That is the reality  of the situation, but it should not be the first option, and, in my opinion, it  will not be the first option under the sustainable schools policy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The proposer of the motion said &mdash; I will paraphrase &mdash; that  a rural school reflects the viability of the rural community. That is an  accurate statement, and it also opens the debate wider, because, if rural  schools are to be viable, rural communities have to be viable. After all, it is  the community that will supply the school with pupils. For that to happen,  there must be a cross-departmental support network for the rural communities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I note and welcome the DARD rural White Paper, which  considers community life in rural communities &mdash; childcare facilities in  particular &mdash; to ensure that rural families can maintain a network in their  community. Support for community infrastructure in rural communities is also  needed. DSD or the social services arm of DHSSPS could provide that support,  but money and resources need to be brought to bear on those networks. Jobs must  be available in rural communities if communities are to be viable, not just in  the agriculture industry but in others, such as the light engineering industry,  which thrives and develops in rural communities. Industry needs support from  DETI and others to ensure that it can start up in rural communities, because,  without jobs and community infrastructure, there will be no schools in rural  communities. That is the simple fact. There must be a cross-departmental  approach to supporting rural schools and rural communities.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Will the Member accept that the converse is also the case? If there is no local  community and no local school, there will be no young people to take jobs and  sustain the economy. It is not a case of having either jobs or schools; a  combination of both is needed.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member will have an extra minute.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  certainly agree with that. It is a circle of life in that sense; one cannot  exist without the other. The only reason that a school will close is if its  enrolments fall. One way or another, parents make that decision. The location  of the school may no longer suit their needs, and they may move out of the area  because of a lack of jobs, investment and community infrastructure. Parents who  live in rural areas are not always first- or second-generation members of rural  communities, and they may naturally go back to urban centres to school their  children, because that is where their family support network is for  babysitting. Those factors must be taken into account.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will not lengthen the debate by repeating what has been  said. Sinn F&eacute;in supports the motion and is relaxed about the amendment. The  amendment offers opportunities &mdash; the Alliance Party is not just offering a  single option with it &mdash; and we support it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  The DUP came to the Chamber today with the idea of supporting the SDLP motion,  but, regrettably, the SDLP has incorporated the amendment into its motion,  which rules out our support. We intend to test the opinion of the House on the  issue, as we cannot support the amendment. The Member from the Alliance Party  who proposed the amendment said that he did not have a problem with the motion,  so it is a bit confusing to see an amendment on the Order Paper. If the  Alliance Party has no problem with the motion, why does it want to amend it?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>:  Does the Member not understand the difference between an amendment and an  addition? The amendment adds to the motion; it does not simply amend it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  The Member must have a different Order Paper to me. His amendment is listed  clearly on the Marshalled List of amendments, and it is listed as &ldquo;Amendment  1&rdquo;. Perhaps, he will take another look and conclude that is not me who is  confused but someone else, but that is a side issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The debate can be useful, although I am not sure that it  will come to any great conclusions. As Members have said, it is good to focus  on rural schools and their future. Rural schools are the heartbeat of a rural  community. Sadly, in the past few years, there has been a real decline in the  number of rural schools. The number of rural schools that have closed is  frightening. Eventually, that impacts on rural communities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not wish to misquote the Minister. She feels that she  has been misquoted at times, so I will try not to do that. She said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;We need to put children&rsquo;s needs at the centre &ndash; it is  our duty, our responsibility and we must rise to the challenge.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Those are her words, not mine.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Mr Storey said, the Minister, the Committee for  Education and the Assembly face the challenge of how we see the shape of rural  schools in the future. Are we merely paying lip service to rural schools? Do we  feel that &ldquo;rural schools&rdquo; is a good phrase to use that clicks with certain  people and might attract a few votes one day? I hope that no party and no  Member will get caught in that scenario. We must declare either that we are  sincere about the future of rural schools or that we see them in a different  light. My party and I are sincere; we want the future of rural schools to be  maintained and kept. That can be achieved only through having a firm strategy.  The Assembly looks to the Department of Education and its Minister to introduce  that strategy. To date, we have not been convinced. We still could be, however.  We implore the Department and its Minister to think rural and to think long and  hard before they go down a road that will disadvantage rural children. Those  children must not be disadvantaged simply because they live in rural  communities.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">6.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We cannot become urbanised, urban-thinking people on every  matter. There has been much talk about transport and how it must be extended to  rural communities. That is good, and the Assembly must do it. However, by the  same token, does the Assembly not need to ensure that rural schools are viable  and have a future? How should that be done? Surely criteria must be established  that differ from those that apply in urban areas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The numbers game is played continually. Rural education &mdash;  indeed, all education &mdash; is measured in pounds and pence. That is how its future  is decided. Sometimes I believe that that is the wrong road to go down. Rural  education and the future of rural schools cannot be measured simply in pounds  and pence. More fundamental, deep and lasting concerns must be considered.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We say to the Minister that she has an opportunity to show  transparently that she has the needs of rural communities at heart. We want her  to apply most of her energy in that direction in order to ensure that small  rural schools have a future. Those schools are and can be viable. They are  important to the future of rural communities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If the Assembly is to keep rural communities alive, it must  keep rural schools alive. The Assembly must start &mdash; I use Mr Ross&rsquo;s phrase &mdash; to  think outside the box. Until now, efforts have not been sufficient or adequate.  It is time that the Assembly thought seriously about those issues. I look  forward to hearing proposals and suggestions from the Minister and her  Department on this important matter.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I share Lord Morrow&rsquo;s concern. When the motion was originally put to us, we  were prepared to accept it. However, we had difficulty with the Alliance  Party&rsquo;s amendment, and we still do, given the fact that the SDLP is considering  adopting it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My party&rsquo;s concern with the amendment is largely down to  its language and the way in which it has been put forward. There may indeed be  occasions when integrated schools are part of a solution. Above all, however,  my party supports parental choice. Situations can be found, particularly in  rural areas, where the problem is that there are too few children for too many  schools. I listened intently to what the Committee Chairperson, Mr Storey, had  to say about the difficulty with falling pupil numbers in schools, which leads  to closures.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bain report illustrates the fact that 60&middot;4% of rural  primary schools have pupil numbers that fall below the required threshold of  105. Furthermore, 77% of rural secondary schools fall below the threshold of  500 pupils. That presents a bit of a dilemma. If the same criteria are to be  applied to urban and rural areas, many schools will close. That is why I agree  with Lord Morrow&rsquo;s suggestion: different criteria must be considered for rural  schools, because different issues must be taken into account. Rural schools  must be kept open because they form an integral part of rural communities. I  believe that the Assembly is required by statute to do that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The debate raises an increasing number of contradictions in  the Minister&rsquo;s position. On the one hand, she claims that she wants equality.  However, the Rural Development Council maintains that people who come from  rural backgrounds suffer disproportionately from the closure of rural schools.  Therefore, if she is trying to look after those folks, that is not a good plan.  On the other hand, she claimed yesterday that she wants children to attend  their nearest school. That shows that the Minister&rsquo;s view is particularly  urban-centric. The criteria that she has put in place mean that what is now the  nearest school for children in rural areas may be closed, which means that  those children will have to travel further than their urban counterparts. Where  is the equality in that?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Rural schools are the heart of our rural communities.  Neither the Minister nor her Department have addressed the issues properly.  Innovative solutions are needed, and it is obvious that one size does not fit  all and that we need to find a range of solutions. That is why I am concerned  about the Alliance Party&rsquo;s amendment, which refers to integrated schools, and I  say that as someone who has been interested enough in such schools to invite  their representatives to Stormont. I believe in the integrated sector, but I do  not understand why the Alliance Party has singled out one sector at the expense  of others. Why was the Irish-medium sector not included in the amendment?  During interventions, Members were asked what they did not understand about the  phrase &ldquo;explore the potential&rdquo;. What part of the phrase &ldquo;and in particular&rdquo;  does the Alliance Party not understand, because such words seem to suggest that  there is only one way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. He raised a valid point about Irish-medium schools  that I had intended to raise. It is no wonder that the Minister has a smile on  her face. She has made special provision, for the sake of a better term, and  she used different criteria. Can we not have the same innovative thinking, for  the sake of a better term, to address the issue of rural schools?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member may have an extra minute in which to speak.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I thank Lord Morrow for his helpful intervention. The Minister claimed that she  has a co-ordinated strategy. However, even this week, when making her statement  about the report &lsquo;Together Towards Entitlement&rsquo; and when talking about other  policies and the ESA, she gave out mixed messages about choice and flexibility.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We need to give local schools the tools to come up with  their own solutions. Neither the Minister nor the Department knows better than  parents, and they do not know better than local communities, which should be  able to find their own way forward on this issue. I am disappointed in the  Alliance Party&rsquo;s amendment, because it is unnecessarily prescriptive. I urge  Members to support the original motion, which calls for pilot projects, and, as  Dominic Bradley said, is sufficiently broad. We should not be prescriptive and  risk discriminating against other sectors.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I  support the motion. We live in a society in which 25% of the population cannot  read or write at a level that gives them the dignity to apply for a job that  they would like, so I am entitled to question anything that comes from the  Department of Education, and that includes its sustainable schools policy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I was a teacher for 30 years in the Republic and in the  North, and, as such, I have strong views about the future education of our  children. Closing schools that are perfectly viable and deliver sound education  does not appeal to me in any shape or form. I reject the notion that small  schools cannot deliver a comprehensive curriculum, because they are doing that  and a great deal more.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Harry Ferguson and John Boyd Dunlop did not go to a big  school. Indeed, most famous inventors who are known throughout the world for  their ingenuity did not. God knows, some of them did not go to school at all.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Like others, I feel passionately about the future of our  rural communities, and I reject the notion that closing rural schools is a way  of putting the heart back into those communities. Such communities have already  been ripped apart because of neglect by government Departments, flawed planning  laws and a failure to value what is important and worth fighting for.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Much has been said about empty desks in schools, but I  wonder whether the Department has ever bothered to find out why desks are  empty. Is it always because of demographic changes and falling population, or  is it possible that some schools are underperforming and parents are refusing  to send their children to them? Is it morally right that good schools with  fewer numbers should be culled to fill those desks? I think not.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the Republic, there was an announcement recently that  all national schools, which are the equivalent of primary schools here, must  have a minimum enrolment of at least 60 pupils. Not surprisingly, there has been  a public outcry, and Protestant schools in particular have opposed it, because  they would largely fail to meet that new quota. However, every indication is  that the Government will have a change of heart, and, if I were their political  adviser, I would strongly advise them to do so. Here, the numbers have been set  much higher, so let us hope that our communities will feel as passionately as  our Southern counterparts about the issue and raise the roof of the Department  of Education and get it to stop this madness.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The situation for secondary schools in rural communities is  much worse, with the minimum enrolment set at 500. Implementing that  requirement would cut a swathe through large parts of the rural community. The  Department should be creating incentives to develop the community school  concept that was embraced in the South many years ago but which was thrown out  in the North in the 70s.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Good schools and good teachers do not need to pack children  in like battery hens in order to deliver a comprehensive education, and the  practice of doing that may well be contributing to the low levels of literacy  and numeracy that I mentioned earlier. For example, a lesson in road traffic  studies can be an exciting experience in history, mathematics, science and, indeed,  road safety, just as a lesson in business studies can be an exciting world tour  in geography, modern languages, transport, economics and many other subjects  that children find fascinating. Such lessons teach children about the real  world, but the people who are pushing through the proposed measures do not live  there.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I sincerely hope that the Minister takes the message in the  motion to heart. No one is arguing that there should be no change; change  happens all the time. However, small schools need the support of the Department  to develop projects that ensure that they remain viable and attractive to the  catchment areas that they serve. That requires imagination, creativity and  vision on the part of the Department. To date, I have seen little evidence of that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A working example of a federation exists in the Garvagh and  Glenullin area, where two small schools are now experiencing a population  explosion. Does the Minister, who has expressed great commitment to the development  of language and culture, accept the fact that having no schools and teachers in  the areas where those aspects of life are under threat and under&shy;developed will  mean that there is no hope of success?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am very proud to support the motion, and, as a rural  dweller, I sincerely hope that the Minister will respond positively to what has  been said here today.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Irwin</strong>: I  thank the Members who tabled the motion. Indeed, one of them represents the  Newry and Armagh constituency that I, too,  represent. In that constituency, there are many small rural schools that are an  immense asset to their communities. The benefits that small rural schools bring  to their communities and to the development of children who wish to be schooled  in a rural setting are hard to quantify. However, one thing is certain: those  schools are a cherished part of the infrastructure of Newry and Armagh.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When I last spoke in the Chamber about rural schooling, I  urged the Minister to halt rural school closures except where local agreement  had been reached, and I asked her to ensure that the rural proofing of the  sustainable schools policy was underpinned by criteria that were appropriate  and realistic for schools serving a rural community. In that debate, I referred  to Keady and Aghavilly primary schools, which are small rural schools that  cater for the Protestant community in that area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The issues faced are similar in both sectors, and it is  clear that the parents and teachers involved cherish the schools and want to  keep them open.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">7.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I represent a largely rural constituency and, along with  other Members from that constituency, have been involved in many meetings about  trying to keep some of our smaller rural schools from closing. In each case,  the obvious concern has been pupil enrolments and how a small rural school can  increase its enrolments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Applying the viability cut-off is a broad-brush approach,  and, as has been argued, one that does not take into account each school and  its connections and ties with the community. Simply closing a school using a  quota system is not best practice and gives scant regard to the impact that  such an action would have on the community and the children. Those children  would have to move from their local area to travel to larger schools that are  often many miles away.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I urge the Minister to place a greater value on our rural  schools and to seek ways to safeguard those schools, which are a vital part of  our rural fabric. I have seen successful amalgamations in my constituency; for  example, the amalgamation of Annaghmore and Tullyroan primary schools. However,  that is not always practical or possible, as amalgamation is not always  suitable to the needs of an area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I could say more on the condition of some of our small  rural schools and on the need for urgent upgrades to classrooms, play  facilities, parking, and so on. The Minister has a remit to ensure that  existing schools are suitably equipped and in a sustainable state of repair.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is much to consider and much work to do if we are to  say with certainty that the sustainable schools policy will safeguard our rural  way of life. I await with interest the response of the Minister on those many  issues, as I know for sure that the small rural schools, which are under  threat, will not go down without a fight.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education (Ms Ruane)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Today&rsquo;s  debate focuses on small schools, and I welcome the opportunity to explain how  the sustainable schools policy fully recognises the particular needs of rural  communities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also welcome the opportunity to highlight that we cannot  continue unchanged into the future. We cannot pretend that there is not  demographic decline nor can we hide from the reality that very low pupil  numbers make it difficult to deliver a high-quality educational experience for  young people that is characterised by a broad and balanced educational  experience for pupils. We must also be aware that very small post-primary  schools struggle to provide pupils with access to a full set of subject choices  that can be pursued to the highest level.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I pay tribute to my colleague Michelle Gildernew and say  that my Department will be actively working with her in relation to the rural  White Paper. To that end, I met some of the farming organisations to discuss  the range of issues pertaining to our rural schools.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members have thrown around numbers and alleged that  there have been endless school closures. I want to set the record straight.  Since May 2007, there have been 41 school closures: that encompasses 25 primary  schools, two Irish-medium units, two nursery units, two special schools and 10  post-primary schools. Of the 25 primary schools closed, 23 had fewer than 50  pupils at the date of closure, and of the 10 secondary schools closed, nine had  fewer than 100 pupils.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I understand that the enrolment thresholds in the  sustainable schools policy have caused concern, particularly for small rural  primary schools and the communities that they serve.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Aibhseoidh m&eacute; ar&iacute;s nach bhfuil treochta&iacute; rollaithe ach ar  cheann de na s&eacute; chrit&eacute;ar a chuirtear san &aacute;ireamh agus inmharthanacht scoile &aacute;  meas. Thar aon rud eile, is &eacute; an sol&aacute;thar d&rsquo;oideachas ardchaighde&aacute;in an rud is  t&aacute;bhachta&iacute;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I emphasise again that enrolment trends are only one of the  six criteria to be considered in assessing a school&rsquo;s viability. Above all, the  provision of a high-quality education is the key consideration. I reiterate  that schools will not be closed simply because their enrolments fall below the  thresholds. The criteria, and their associated indicators, provide a framework  for the early identification of emerging problems and possible remedial action.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The issues that affect rural schools are reflected in the  sustainable schools policy. Maurice Morrow said that we should have different  criteria for rural schools: we do. The policy includes a lower enrolment  threshold for rural primary schools and a criterion that looks at accessibility  and provides guidance on how long we expect children to travel between their  homes and their schools. The policy also includes a criterion for a school to  have strong links with the community, which ensures that local community  involvement with schools and the contribution that schools make to their  communities are included in any consideration of a school&rsquo;s viability.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The rural nature of the North of Ireland means that there  will always be a significant number of small, rural schools. Apart from a short  period in my life, I have always lived in a rural community. I still live in a  rural community.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The common funding formula includes specific factors.  Members asked that special measures be provided for rural schools: we already  do that. There are minimum funding levels designed to help small rural schools  to meet the needs of their pupils, particularly in the delivery of the  curriculum. In addition to the small schools support factor, minimum funding  thresholds are applied in the foundation stage of the primary curriculum and  primary principals&rsquo; release time funding.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I commend the contribution that some small schools make to  educational attainment and community cohesion. However, we must also recognise  that many small schools encounter difficulties, not only with delivering the  curriculum but in operating within their budgets. The challenge has become  greater in primary schools in which there are more than two age groups in a  composite class. Small post-primary schools also face a number of challenges,  particularly in ensuring the continuing availability of sufficient specialist  teachers to allow them to provide effective teaching and assessment in all  areas of the curriculum.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The sustainable schools policy does not seek a one-model-fits-all  solution to the problems brought about by demographic decline. Rather, it  provides a consistent framework in which any review of a school&rsquo;s viability can  be handled carefully and sensitively, taking account of local circumstances on  a case-by-case basis.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Cuideoidh an polasa&iacute; do scoileanna inmharthana linn chun a  chinnti&uacute; go bhfaigheann gach p&aacute;iste oideachas den scoth, beag beann ar a gc&uacute;lra  n&oacute; ar an &aacute;it ina bhfuil siad ina gc&oacute;na&iacute;. Ina theannta sin, cinnteoidh s&eacute;  freisin go mbainfear an &uacute;s&aacute;id is fearr as na hacmhainn&iacute; at&aacute; ar f&aacute;il don  oideachas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The sustainable schools policy will help us to ensure that  all our children get a first-class education regardless of their background or  where they live. Equally, it will make the best use of the resources available  for education.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion calls on me to enact suitable pilot projects to  develop ways of maintaining the viability of our smaller schools. I ask the  House to recognise that my Department and its educational partners are already  implementing or bringing forward a range of policies and projects to address  that. The entitlement framework will guarantee all post-primary pupils aged 14  years and above greater choice and flexibility by providing them with access to  a wide range of learning opportunities, irrespective of where they live or the  school that they attend.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The framework will help to ensure that all pupils, however  remote their location, are not disadvantaged. The establishment of  area-learning communities, where schools work together and with further  education colleges and other providers, and the use of distance learning  methods where appropriate, will enable schools to collaborate to ensure that  there is sufficient breadth and balance in courses.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the amendment notes, the development of shared  educational facilities is a practical means of preserving local education in  rural communities. The development of a shared educational campus in Omagh is  an example of how my Department aims to shape the way that education is  delivered here. It provides an example of an alternative and innovative way to  address viability issues faced by rural schools with reducing pupil numbers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Tr&iacute; &aacute;iseanna a fhorbairt a ligeann do scoileanna comhoibri&uacute;  thar an gcuraclam, t&aacute; f&eacute;idearthachta&iacute; iontacha ann chun beala&iacute; nua a fh&aacute;il le  teagasc, foghlaim agus foirgnimh scoile a chomhroinnt.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The development of facilities that allow schools to  collaborate across the curriculum offers exciting possibilities for new ways to  share teaching, learning and school buildings. I understand that the Council  for Catholic Maintained Schools (CCMS) has been examining the potential for  federated projects in a number of parishes, and I am confident that the new  education and skills authority (ESA) will introduce a range of creative and innovative  projects that, like the shared educational campus in Omagh, will develop ways  of maintaining the viability of schools through collaboration and partnership  while ensuring that investment in the education estate provides the best  outcome for children.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My overall objective is to create a system of strong,  sustainable schools. John O&rsquo;Dowd was absolutely right when he talked about  vibrant, strong, sustainable communities. That is the key; we cannot consider  schools alone. We must consider the range of governmental policies on  decentralisation, jobs and the need for communities to work together. Our  education system needs to be planned on an area basis to provide high-quality  education for our children and young people. Equality must be its cornerstone.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The sustainable schools policy is a key element of the  policy framework that I will put in place. The &lsquo;Every School a Good School&rsquo;  policy, the revised curriculum, transfer 2010, the review of Irish-medium  education, the special education and inclusion review and the entitlement  framework are at the heart of that policy. Members will note that, at its  heart, transfer 2010 ensures that rural schools are protected. Moreover, it  ensures that rural dwellers are not disadvantaged by linking criteria for entry  into post-primary schools. As area-based planning develops, those policies will  drive the delivery of education and the consequential reshaping and investment  in our schools estate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will take the amendment in the spirit in which it was  intended. I do not believe that Trevor Lunn and his party are trying to say  that the integrated sector or the Irish-medium sector should receive  preferential treatment. I believe that they are saying, and it is my  Department&rsquo;s view, that the integrated sector was not treated fairly in the  past and that we need to deal with that inequality.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This morning, I visited Lagan College  and had discussions with the young people there. It is wrong that that school  had to endure a delay to the investment that it deserves. Last week, I visited  Col&aacute;iste Feirste during the launch of new computer packages in Irish. The  Irish-medium sector and the integrated sector have the most Portakabins in the  North of Ireland. That needs to be changed, and I hope that all Members will  support this important amendment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The new area-based approach represents a significant change  in planning provision in schools, preschool and youth facilities. It will  afford another opportunity to consider the role and structure of small rural  schools in the wider context of education provision in local areas. Transport  was mentioned earlier. Currently, our children travel 1&middot;4 million miles a day  on school transport. If, and when, our transfer 2010 proposals are put in  place, our children will travel 400 miles a day. That will result in a  significant reduction in transport costs and carbon emissions. I have often  said that I can do more to reduce carbon emissions than the Minister of the  Environment and the Minister for Regional Development combined.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Yesterday, I informed the House of the findings and  recommendations of the &lsquo;Together Towards Entitlement&rsquo; report, which considered  an area-based approach to planning for the delivery of the entitlement  framework. The report highlights the need for, and importance of, an area-based  approach to planning, and I will work closely with the ESA, school owners and  promoters and schools to develop that approach in the best interests of all  young people.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To achieve that end, I will, where necessary, explore all  opportunities for collaboration and partnership, and I will provide small  schools with the support that will allow them to continue to provide a  first-class education for our children. However, I will not be afraid to make  difficult decisions to ensure that all our children receive a first-class  education experience.</p>

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  pay tribute to the Minister for her comments on shared education and integrated  education, which were extremely positive and represented a realistic  recognition of the opportunities in those areas. We can build on that platform.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is worth cross-referencing this debate with our earlier  deliberations on public spending. There are pressures on the education system.  We must recognise that the current empty school places are unsustainable and  that the situation will get worse. There will have to be a process of  rationalisation, and we will have to implement the sustainable schools policy.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Does the Member not accept that there is a contradiction in his argument? On  the one hand, he commends the Minister for giving an accolade to integrated  schools, and, on the other hand, he talks about the cost. He knows that the  Deloitte document clearly states that, because we have too many sectors, it  costs Northern Ireland plc millions of additional pounds, yet he advocates a  sector that will cost our education system more money to run. Hypocrisy.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member will have an extra minute in which to speak.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  First, the Member needs to withdraw the call of hypocrisy, if he wants to do  so.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  No.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: On  a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. The Member has accused me of being a  hypocrite, which is unparliamentary language. Will you ask him to withdraw the  comment?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Members have been asked to moderate their language on several  occasions in the past. I will give the Member an opportunity to reflect on  that, and, perhaps, withdraw the remark so that we can move on. Otherwise, I  will pass the matter to the Speaker for a resolution.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  did not call the Member a hypocrite. I said that his position was hypocrisy. If  the Member is happy to have the matter referred to the Speaker, I am quite  happy to take whatever punishment that the headmaster feels is necessary.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:  Please continue, Dr Farry. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.] </span>Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  shall continue in the good traditions of British parliamentary democracy, which  the Member does not abide by, and I will move on. I will address the comments  that the Member made in the course of the debate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have to be balanced and reflect the importance and  cohesion of rural communities, and I take on board John O&rsquo;Dowd&rsquo;s comments in  that regard. The motion faces up to the problems and does not duck the  situation. Dominic Bradley made that clear in accepting that there is a  sustainable schools policy in place that sets thresholds.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party amendment seeks to highlight a potential  way forward that builds on the motion. I will address Lord Morrow&rsquo;s point: the  amendment is an addition to the motion; it does not detract from it. It  provides further clarity and identifies a potential opportunity in addition to  the SDLP motion, which we support.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to respond to the comments that have been made in  the debate about integrated education and shared education. Mr Storey made a  point about rationalisation and the need to rise to the challenge. I have done  that in my constituency, where I supported the closure of an integrated school  that had only 20 pupils. Although I support the integrated sector, I am not  prepared to shy away from tough decisions. My record is clear.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members must recognise that the amendment refers to  integrated education and other forms of shared education. The term &ldquo;shared&rdquo;  implies potential co-operation between different sectors. The Alliance Party  recognises that shared education can be offered in a range of ways.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Rural communities experience particular difficulties in  maintaining sustainable schools. By and large, the schools in those communities  belong to various sectors. If rationalisation occurs on a sectoral basis, the  likelihood of no local option being available will be much greater, as will the  risk of children having to be bussed to schools in other villages or towns.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, if parents are allowed to make a pragmatic choice,  they may choose an integrated school. That school would not necessarily have to  be a newbuild; it could be the result of an amalgamation of schools.  Alternatively, parents may opt for one of the many forms of shared education,  including shared campuses, which may represent a more realistic and sustainable  way of providing local education in those communities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Integrated education raises a wider issue. I accept that a  range of educational sectors exists in Northern Ireland, as will probably  be the case for many years to come. I make no apology for advocating integrated  schools. I do not agree with Mr Storey that integrated education is a further  fragmentation of an already fragmented system. Integrated schools are,  potentially, the most financially, as well as educationally, sound way of  moving forward. To that extent, my comments are consistent with the Deloitte  report.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am disappointed by the approach of the Ulster Unionist  Party. Every time it is asked to back up its rhetoric on a shared future with  its stance on testing, it fails. The antics of the UUP in the Chamber, in  trying to spook the other parties, stands in contrast to its sole remaining MP,  who has been a strong advocate of integrated schools and shared education. It  is a pity that the UUP does not learn a lesson from the fact that she is the  only member of that party who is capable of being elected to Westminster.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I want to clarify Lord Morrow&rsquo;s comment on the amendment: the SDLP has not  adopted it as part of its motion. We are happy for the amendment to be put to  the vote, of course, and to support it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This is the second debate on schools this year. I thank  Members who contributed to the debate on small schools that took place before  the summer recess. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. There are too many conversations going on in the Chamber.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  The motion was tabled because the problem of over-provision of school places  has been recognised, and steps must be taken to address that. However, we face  that problem against the background of the Bain report, which highlighted two  issues: the financial implications for schools because of their enrolments, and  the capacity of schools to deliver the new curriculum. That new curriculum is  so broad that I doubt that anyone in the Chamber could name any of its 27  subjects. If schoolchildren were asked about the new curriculum, they would  sigh and groan because they are not sure what it is all about. That is what we  are up against.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister mentioned her sustainable schools policy,  which contains some good points but requires more work. It introduced a maximum  travel time of 45 minutes. I make it clear to Members, and perhaps the  Department of Education will also take on board, that the message about the sustainable  schools policy is not being received. The educational professionals have not  heard of it, and people in other authorities know little about it, to the  extent that they scratch their heads when it is mentioned. That may have  something to do with the fact that the Minister introduced the policy, which  faced some criticism, in the middle of the night that preceded the debate on  small schools.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is more to education than economics. Economic  constraints should not determine the future of our rural schools, which, as  Members have said, are so closely linked to communities. Some Members mentioned  educational factors. Pupils who live with the consequences of social  deprivation and disadvantage need good pastoral care and support, and our rural  schools do an excellent job in providing it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are environmental as well as educational  considerations. The sustainable schools policy may be in place, but it is not  understood, and the thrust is towards centralisation. In my constituency, for  example, the plan is to bus all the children to Enniskillen. I am sure that  representatives of other constituencies could highlight similar examples. We do  not counter that by keeping all our schools open. I have not heard the  Department, or anyone else, mention the concept, but it is clear that all those  who contributed to the debate want a strong network of good rural schools.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Everyone who cares about education must recognise the need  for that, so the Department, the various authorities and everyone else must  start working towards meeting that challenge. My colleague Dominic Bradley  spoke about federated projects, which are a very good idea. The Alliance Party  spoke about cross-sectoral support. School authorities have a great deal more  work to do on joint provision. If we set school authorities the task of  creating a network of good rural schools, they will begin to work more closely  together in some areas. We must build on the positive signs that are emerging  from various school authorities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We draw encouragement from some of the Minister&rsquo;s points,  although she did talk about the rural White Paper. Other Departments are  watching progress on the rural White Paper closely, but it has still not been  published. I advise the Department of Education to tell the Department of Agriculture  and Rural Development to hurry up and produce it. John O&rsquo;Dowd, Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s  education spokesperson, was right about the great damage being caused,  particularly to smaller schools, by the threat that hangs over them. The sooner  someone gets to work on the rural White Paper, the better it will be for  everyone.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister also mentioned shared facilities, but the  Omagh site is not the best place to start the development of shared facilities.  Representatives of the different sectors in the various parishes and townlands  are interested in joint provision at a local level, and they should be  encouraged in that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The views of the Alliance Party are summed up in the  amendment, and we do not disagree with those views.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mervyn Storey spoke about our acceptance of the Bain  report&rsquo;s minimum enrolments. I have already mentioned why we should not do  that. Let us temper those thresholds and make them more appropriate to our  circumstances, particularly in the rural constituencies of Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">7.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Michelle O&rsquo;Neill pointed to the sustainable schools policy  and the six criteria. I find that the message about the 45-minute criterion has  not been received on the ground. The Department should ensure that something is  done about that. John McCallister outlined quite rightly and very clearly the  problems of social deprivation. He said that the disadvantages faced by  children in rural areas will be further emphasised if we go down the road of  centralisation, whether at primary or post-primary level.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We all understand what Alastair Ross meant when he said  that rural schools are at the heart of our community. They are crucial. John  O&rsquo;Dowd put his finger on the issue when he said that we are in a situation in  which the rumour mill runs ahead of what we do here. The Department and the  other authorities need to get up to speed. A range of other Members spoke, and  one of the most passionate was my colleague John Dallat, who spoke from  experience. He articulated his case very well. William Irwin also spoke from a  rural perspective and pointed out well the importance of rural schools.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have to formulate a way forward. We must work to ensure  that we end up with a strong network of good rural schools.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText"><span class="Italic">Question,</span> That the amendment be  made, <span class="Italic">put and negatived.</span></p>

    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="10"></a>Adjournment</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Lurgan Area: Improvement Scheme for 19 Rural Cottages</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind Members that the proposer of the topic for the  Adjournment debate will have 15 minutes in which to speak. All other Members  who wish to speak will have approximately seven minutes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I have in my hand the oldest  active file in my constituency office. I emphasise that because this is not a  debate to get at Margaret Ritchie or the SDLP.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Shame on you. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  know. It depends how the debate goes. I have been working on this constituency  issue since the summer of 2000. It started in the same way as many constituency  cases. An elderly gentleman called to my constituency office one day and spoke  to me about his home. I hopped in the car and we went to look at his house. As  we approached the cottage, I wondered why the gentleman had a difficulty,  because the outside had recently been renovated. An extensive amount of public  funds had been spent on an external maintenance scheme, which led to the  building of a new roof, new drainage systems, and a lovely concrete footpath  down to the front of the house. The gardens had been levelled, and the house  looked really well.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When I walked into the house, however, it was like walking  into the first part of the twentieth century. No work had been carried out  inside the house for a considerable period. The heating system was antiquated, and  the kitchen was dilapidated. That elderly gentleman lived there with his wife  and his daughter, and, like many rural families, they had reared a family in  the house. At that stage, all he wanted was the inside of the house to be  renovated and brought up to standard.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I spoke to the area&rsquo;s district housing manager and, in  fairness to him, the very next day we were back out at the house again. The  manager shared my concern that such a large amount of public money had been  spent on the outside of the house but not a penny spent on the inside. The  district housing manager set about doing a bit of work on the issue of the  bungalow. I have no criticism of that Housing Executive officer. He came back  to me with a report some months later and told me that, in his opinion, the  house needed to be bulldozed, because, when it was looked at, the work involved  in carrying out an internal maintenance scheme would be a waste of money, even  though all that money had been spent on outside improvements.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">So, there we were, heading towards 2001-02. At the  beginning of 2002, I started to ask more questions about rural cottages in the  Lurgan area. As discussions continued in the form of private meetings,  correspondence and exchanges across, at that stage, the council chamber, it  became clear that around 19 rural cottages in the Housing Executive&rsquo;s Lurgan  district office area needed extensive work. Some needed bulldozing; others  needed external and internal maintenance schemes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Housing Executive put those houses together in a single  scheme, because, from its point of view, and I have no reason to doubt or argue  against it, it would be more economical to include the 19 houses in one scheme  and bring forward a package of funding for that scheme. That promise was made  in 2003, and, being the reasonable character that I am, I accepted what the  Housing Executive said about taking only two years to bring forward the scheme.  In the world of bureaucracy, two years is not that bad, when one allows for  planning, budgets, and all of those matters.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, we waited; and, late in 2005, Mr Simmons, the  gentleman with whom I was dealing, got word from the Housing Executive that  more work was going to be done to his house. It was not going to be bulldozed  or rebuilt, but more work was to be done to the inside of the house. He and I  questioned the Housing Executive about the wisdom of spending more money on the  inside of his house, when doing so was clearly a waste of public funds.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also spoke to the Housing Executive about a number of  other cottages in the area on which it intended to spend money. The obvious  question that I put was: what happened to the extensive maintenance scheme that  had been promised and the rebuild? The reply was that there would be no  rebuild. There was no money and no provision to do that. That was in 2005.  Neither the Minister for Social Development nor I were Members of the Assembly  at that time. Therefore, this is not a &ldquo;pick on Margaret&rdquo; day.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As 2005 went on, I continued to lobby about the 19 cottages  and I visited a number of them. What struck me most about them was that if  there was a row of houses or a small housing estate in an urban centre in which  there were 19 properties that were unfit for human habitation, as some of these  were &mdash; indeed I still maintain that the house that I initially dealt with is  unfit to live in &mdash; the problem would not have been allowed to continue.  However, because the 19 houses were isolated and because an individual rather  than a community voice was raised, and, perhaps, due to the nature of rural  people who do not want to push themselves forward or ask for what is not theirs  &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Yes, that is right.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Dolores Kelly is the obvious exception to that rule. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The houses continued in disrepair. I was repeatedly  informed between 2005 and 2007 that work would not go ahead. Eventually, we got  the good news that &pound;498,000 had been secured for a scheme on the properties.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To emphasise the poor condition of the houses in 2003, I  will read from a Housing Executive letter of that year:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;A project team to review the work required to all  cottages in Lurgan has been initiated and a consultant will shortly be  appointed to carry out a feasibility study and analysis. Recent experiences  with similar schemes would indicate that a high proportion of the cottages will  require redevelopment, involving demolition and rebuilding by the Housing  Association.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That shows what a poor condition the cottages were  in then. So, in 2007, it was good news when we realised that funding had been  secured and that the work would take place approximately a year later. The year  came and went and, lo and behold, in 2009, all the tenants received letters to  tell them that the work had been cancelled.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In 2000, 2003 and 2005, a high proportion of the houses  were below standard. Some of them were unfit for human habitation and, indeed,  in the meantime, the wife of the gentleman in my original case had died, so  they never got to enjoy their new house. Then, in 2009, the tenants of those 19  isolated rural cottages in the Lurgan area were told that there is no money, no  work and no hope.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I understand the pressures that are on all Departments,  including the Department for Social Development (DSD), but I brought this case  to the House&rsquo;s attention not simply because I have been dealing with it, but  because it has been ongoing for nine years. I know that Mrs Kelly has been  involved, and I am sure that colleagues from across the Chamber have also been  involved in similar lobbying, because the houses cover a wide geographical area  and, in our divided society, they are cross-community in nature. So this is not  just John O&rsquo;Dowd complaining about a nine-year-old case. In fact, one of my colleagues  said earlier that the fact that I have not managed to resolve the case in nine  years may prove that I am not a very effective representative, and that may  well be true. This debate will prove that one way or the other. I brought the  case before the House to highlight that fact that after nine years, &mdash; indeed,  with respect to the first house that I visited, after, perhaps, 39 years &mdash; of  insufficient work being done to the property and a significant waste of public  funds on, on one occasion, an extensive renovation, as well as minor repairs  being carried out.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have an opportunity to start again; to knock down the  houses that require rebuilding and to completely renovate the others.  Consequently, those rural dwellers, many of whom are elderly and have reared  their families &mdash; in some cases, the next generation is living in the house now,  because their elderly parents have passed on &mdash; will have an opportunity to live  in the same standard of housing that my constituents in the Shankill or  Kilwilkie estates or in Craigavon would expect. There is no way that an urban  community would put up with the standard of living in which those people must  live.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the scheme is not  overlooked again in any budgetary discussions in her Department, especially  with the Housing Executive, and that it will become a priority, as it was in  2003, 2005 and 2007, in the Lurgan district housing office and in the Department  for Social Development, so that those people are given equality of opportunity  for housing. Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I thank the Member for securing the debate. As someone who was born and bred,  and whose father still lives, in one of those rural cottages, I am quite  familiar with the problems that are associated with them and, indeed, with the  layout and, in many cases, the location of the cottages. I know from experience  with my grandparents that when money was available, my grandmother would not  allow work to be carried out because of my grandfather&rsquo;s failing health. I am  sure that that is part of the problem. People do not want to go through the  bother. There is too little social housing stock into which to decant people  during major works, and people from rural areas will not move into towns,  although sometimes mobile homes are suggested as an alternative means of  accommodation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not expect the Minister to be accountable for what  happened in the past. As Mr O&rsquo;Dowd said, in the past, in the years when there  was no devolved Assembly, the schemes were approved but the work did not  happen. I hope, and I am confident, that the Minister is putting right the  organisation and accountability mechanisms in the Housing Executive and  district offices, and that priority will be given to those who are most in  need.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Recently, I wrote about one such cottage in the Ballycairn  area, where work is to commence in the new year because it meets the needs of a  disabled young man. I welcome the fact that work will commence on that and that  the money is available for it.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">7.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Dowd is right in so far as rural people have lower  expectations and put up with a lot more than would many people in town. My  question for the Minister is as follows: as many of these homes are unfit, what  impact on the waiting list would a statutory notice have, if it were served  upon the Housing Executive by the environmental services department of a local  council? Would that enable the Minister&rsquo;s Department to spend money outside of  her current priorities? That might be the case in one or more instances. I  wonder whether housing associations have any role to play in taking  responsibility for any of these homes. They might have a budget that could  assist in getting the work done. We need to have a degree of creativity in this  very tight economic climate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The cottages referred to are scattered across the Craigavon  Borough Council area. Practically all the villages are represented. Very few  such houses are still in public ownership, and that is to be lamented because we  all know that we cannot get people to take the latent demand test, yet, when a  house becomes available, all of a sudden there is a deluge of applications.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Housing Executive must address planning for the longer  term in terms of new housing stock and opportunities that might arise through  co-operation with housing associations. There are still pockets of land  available in public ownership across the rural areas. Have any of the housing  associations made representation to the Department? That would provide  opportunities in cases where homes are deemed to be fit only for demolition.  That may be another solution or way out of this difficulty.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Dowd has confined his remarks to the Lurgan area, but  I have no doubt that there are such difficulties right across the North.  Perhaps the Minister can inform us of the Housing Executive&rsquo;s overall strategic  plan for rural housing, because, as Mr O&rsquo;Dowd said, rural areas often get a raw  deal. Is there any opportunity for collaborative working across government  Departments? The Agriculture Minister has &pound;10 million to alleviate rural  poverty. Has there been any consultation at ministerial level as to how that  money is best spent? Housing inequalities lead to poor health outcomes, so that  is a conversation worth having at ministerial level.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Like Mr O&rsquo;Dowd, I want to see priority given to older  people and people with disabilities who are living in conditions deemed to be  unfit. The Executive needs to take ownership of this problem. Yesterday,  Members talked about poverty and health outcomes. Members want a healthier  people in the North, and we must look at funding the housing budget properly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development (Ms Ritchie)</strong>: I thank John O&rsquo;Dowd for tabling this  Adjournment topic, and Dolores Kelly. They have both contributed this evening.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the opportunity to clarify some of the issues  raised, and I will try to address all of them. I assure Members that I will  study the Hansard report, and if I have left any of their questions unanswered,  I will write directly to the Member concerned.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I must first declare an interest. I was reared in what was  then known as a &ldquo;labourer&rsquo;s cottage&rdquo;, which my late parents bought in 1969.  That was the house in which my father was brought up, so it is about 98 or 99  years old. Therefore, I know what it was like to live in such a cottage; in  fact, I still live in it, although it has been renovated. I know the space  standards of such cottages, and I know that many large families were reared in  them. I also know what it is like to live in a rural community. People in rural  communities have lesser expectations and make do with less. It is not always  right for them to do that, but that is the way that they are. I sympathise with  the people whom Mr O&rsquo;Dowd and Mrs Kelly mentioned, because I can empathise with  their position.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There can be no one in the Chamber who is not aware of the  shortfall that the housing budget faces due to the collapse of the land and  property market. Between last year and next, I face a housing budget shortfall  of over &pound;300 million. No one in the House or in Northern Ireland is to blame for  that; it is a consequence of the economic downturn. As a result of that  shortfall, difficult and sad decisions have had to be made. The Housing  Executive has had no choice but to prioritise its expenditure across all its  programmes, including the sort of multi-element improvement schemes that we are  discussing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am conscious of the fact that Mr O&rsquo;Dowd has been working  on this case since 2000, and I would like to find out why it took so long to  progress the scheme in the earlier years. Although I have been trying to do  that, I would like to be able to examine it further and come back to Mr O&rsquo;Dowd  and Mrs Kelly on it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although we are talking about the 19 homes in the Lurgan  area, we could be talking about any one of a number of similar schemes across  the North that have not been able to proceed due to the funding pressures.  Members may be interested to know that there are 3,777 Housing Executive homes  awaiting a multi-element improvement scheme, at a cost of over &pound;114 million. I  do not want to deny people the chance to live in a decent home. Everyone  deserves a decent home to live in but, when allocating scarce resources, the choice  is whether to improve the homes of those fortunate enough to have one or  provide a home for those who have none. I know what the conditions of some of  those cottages are, because I have seen them in my rural community, and I know  that it is not fair to ask people to live in them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With almost 40,000 people on the waiting list for social  housing, half of whom are in housing stress, the shortfall in my budget has  meant that we have to focus on where the need is greatest. I have, therefore,  decided that my first priority must be to support and protect society&rsquo;s most  vulnerable, such as the homeless, those in fuel poverty and those in need of  supported housing. This year, I have set aside the resources to deliver 1,750  new homes, which is our largest number of new homes for a decade.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members must also be aware that, paradoxically in this  challenging economic climate, the time has never been better to maximise  investment in social housing. For every 10 jobs that are created by expanding  the social housing development programme, at least a further seven are created  or sustained elsewhere in the supply chain and the retail sector. Therefore,  the delivery of homes not only helps those in greatest need, but acts as a  stimulus for the local economy. Construction costs have also been falling, so  we can get more for our money.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">According to our records, John O&rsquo;Dowd first raised the  issue of the cottages in Lurgan with the Housing Executive as far back as May  2003. However, Mr O&rsquo;Dowd tells me that it was much earlier than that. I want to  examine all of that detail, so it would be helpful if Mr O&rsquo;Dowd supplies me  with copies of the correspondence, so that I can have a full investigation.  Dolores Kelly also has correspondence, and I want to carry out a full  investigation as to why there was a delay.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Mr O&rsquo;Dowd and Mrs Kelly are aware, most of the cottages  are located in small settlements on the outskirts of Lurgan. They were  constructed between 1908 and 1939, which is around the same time as other  similar cottages throughout the North of Ireland were built. Various  improvement works have been carried out over the years, but I accept that they  all require extensive renovations. There have been various delays in bringing  this work forward since it was first approved by the board of the Housing  Executive in 2006.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The scheme has been revised a few times since then, and it  currently has a provisional start date of June 2010. Unfortunately, that is  conditional on the resources being available and, as Members have already  heard, there is no guarantee of that in the current financial climate. Indeed,  as I said earlier, that uncertainty applies to more than just the 19 cottages  in question.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The effects of the budget shortfall mean that every  improvement scheme similar to this one is now subject to the same funding  issue, and I know that Members understand and appreciate that fact. It should  also be understood that no mainstream government investment programme in any  other Department has been decimated in the same way.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I take on board what Mrs Kelly said about the possibility  of funding and the rural development sphere. I will contact my ministerial  colleague Minister Gildernew about those issues, and, because there are  associated health and well-being issues, I will also contact the Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety. I want to examine whether there are  any possibilities for co-operation in that regard.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I make no apologies for repeating my call to put the  housing budget on a more sound and firm financial footing. Relying on the  vagaries of the land and property market alongside in-year quarterly bids is no  way to fund long-term infrastructure programmes. We are all trying to grapple  with that, and we have come to the realisation that housing must be put on a  different financial footing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am not just sitting back, wringing my hands and hoping  for more resources to come my way. Officials in the Department&rsquo;s housing  division have already been working very closely with their counterparts in the  Housing Executive and the housing association movement to identify new and  creative opportunities that could see some of the improvement programmes  restarted. Mrs Kelly referred to the role of the housing associations and work  on a particular scheme in Derry, which was the  subject of some debate earlier. There is no doubt that others could be  investigated.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am very optimistic about the potential that such work  creates, and I am very happy to get back to Members in the coming months, once  the necessary approvals for those new proposals have been obtained.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have touched on the various issues raised by Mr O&rsquo;Dowd  and Mrs Kelly. I am also conscious of the need to get other Departments  involved, namely the Agriculture Department and the Health Department, as I  think that Members are saying to me that a special case must be made for  cottages throughout Northern    Ireland. I am quite happy to examine that  issue and to pursue it with others, notwithstanding the fact that other  Ministers and Departments are subject to the same financial constraints as me.  However, DSD is different because its budget is predicated &mdash; like no other &mdash; on  the income it can raise from land and house sales.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I trust that Members across the Chamber, and particularly  the residents of the dwellings in question, will understand why I cannot give  them a definite date tonight for the start of the work that they have been  promised for a long time. However, I can assure Members that I, along with my  officials, will undertake an investigation into why the delay was so long, why  there has been such a history to the case and why there was little movement in  the earlier stages.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, I can undertake to conduct cross-departmental  investigations to see if pots of money could be made available. Moreover, I can  assure Members that the Department will continue to explore financial  innovation measures with housing associations to ascertain the possibility of  creating alternative financial models for carrying out improvements to those  types of houses. The Department will get back to Members on those specific  issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the final analysis, there is only one solution among all  the others that have been suggested. All the parties around the Executive table  must agree that housing is too important to be a casualty of the economic  downturn and that it must be put on a sound financial footing once and for all.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank Members for their contributions, and I will return  to them at a later stage with more detailed answers. However, if Members can  supply me with copies of pertinent correspondence, I will ensure that those  issues are investigated.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Adjourned at 7.59 pm.</p>
