                Finance and Personnel that he wishes to make a statement on the
                December monitoring round.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Finance and Personnel (Dr
                Farren):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On behalf of the Executive, I wish to make a
                statement on public spending allocations in 2001-02 following
                the December monitoring round.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At their meeting on 18 January 2002, the
                Executive decided on some reallocations of expenditure for the
                short time that remains in the financial year. Those
                reallocations make use of the resources available from changes
                in the estimated requirements of Departments that emerged in the
                December monitoring round.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Programme for Government has guided our
                prioritisation of the allocations. Inevitably at this late stage
                of the year, however, our focus has been on making necessary
                changes to estimated requirements and fine-tuning allocations,
                rather than on any policy changes or new priorities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The December monitoring round completes the
                process of considering what revisions might be necessary or
                desirable to amend Estimates provision in the current year. The
                process for the passage of the first Budget Bill, which
                addresses the spring Supplementary Estimates for all
                Departments, must begin now.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This monitoring round is governed by the
                timetable for the first Budget Bill, which is tight every year.
                All the stages of Assembly consideration of the spring
                Supplementary Estimates and the Budget Bill must be completed in
                time to secure Royal Assent before the end of the financial
                year, yet we cannot realistically begin this process any earlier
                than mid-December, as we must take account of the latest
                information on spending plans from Departments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some reallocations are possible later through
                the February monitoring round, but those are constrained by the
                ceilings set in the Estimates, which rule out any large-scale
                switches between Departments. Therefore the issues addressed in
                this monitoring round will be the last that can be reflected in
                Supplementary Estimates for this financial year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amount available for reallocation is £73
                million. Once again there are several reasons for the amount’s
                being so high at this stage of the financial year. We would
                normally expect to have a substantial amount, but several
                factors have yielded substantial resources for reallocation now.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Agriculture and Rural
                Development surrendered £12·5 million primarily because of the
                impact of the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak, which disrupted
                planned activity and delayed the obtaining of European Union
                approval for certain programmes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Education needs £13
                million less than planned for threshold payments to teachers
                following the teachers’ pay settlement agreed last January.
                Against this reduction in the estimated accruals cost of the
                threshold payments, the Department will face a pressure of
                £5·5 million in 2002-03, and I will return to that later.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Employment and Learning
                identified several easements amounting to £12·7 million, most
                notably in its New Deal and Jobskills programmes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment can surrender a net £8·6 million from industrial
                development grants and capital receipts after allowing for the
                reallocation of funds to meet a number of inescapable
                contractual obligations in other aspects of assistance to
                industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Elsewhere several Departments have identified
                a range of additional receipts from fees and charges and
                disposal of assets.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before I refer to the bids received, I will
                point out issues affecting 2002-03, as they relate to the
                approach the Executive have agreed for this monitoring round.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The revised Budget for 2002-03 was
                constructed on the basis that we could, without undue risk,
                allocate some £40 million of spending power for planned carry-
                forward into 2002-03 from anticipated underspending this year
                and also set aside £8 million of that anticipated underspending
                to meet urgent pressures in the Health Service. This latter
                allocation to health is shown in the table of allocations in the
                annex to my statement, as it has to be funded from the spending
                power available now.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In proposing this approach in September, my
                predecessor, Mark Durkan, made it clear that it would be
                possible to manage resources in the September and December
                monitoring rounds, and also during 2002-03, and to make good
                these assumptions. I am pleased to report that we are now in a
                position to confirm this by adding £5·7 million from the
                resources now available to us to the £21·3 million we set
                aside in the September round. This leaves a balance of £13
                million to be found in the February monitoring round.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In taking this approach, the Executive have
                considered carefully the need to address positively the
                difficulties which the Health Service is currently facing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, we also need to be realistic about
                the amount that can be spent in this financial year. In other
                words, we need to strike a balance between ensuring that we are
                responding to immediate problems in the short term and making
                sure that our longer-term spending plans for next year are
                properly resourced.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Departments lodged bids for additional
                resources in this monitoring round totalling over £98 million.
                The majority of those bids represent changes in estimates of
                requirements since the Budget for 2001-02 was approved in
                December 2000. Some have arisen from the need to address new
                cost pressures. It is not surprising that the bids are smaller
                than would be the case at other stages, given that there are
                only a few months remaining in this year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given the substantial amounts available, the
                Executive have decided to meet a very large proportion of these
                bids, amounting to some £59 million. Together with the £8
                million already allocated to health and the £5·7 million
                needed to complete the planned carry-over for 2002-03, they
                account for the total resources of £73 million available.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will say a little about the additional
                allocations for each Department. The Department of Agriculture
                and Rural Development will receive an additional £9·8 million,
                £7·1 million of which is to meet the additional costs of
                compensation allowances arising from animal disease, mainly
                brucellosis and tuberculosis. Provision has also been made for
                some further costs arising from the foot-and-mouth disease
                crisis and BSE.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure
                will receive funding to assist smaller museums and will retain
                receipts from the sale of some surplus property to undertake
                pressing maintenance work within the public library estate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the September monitoring round, Mark
                Durkan announced that the Executive had agreed to set aside
                £1·9 million for the deficit in funding for the Museums and
                Galleries of Northern Ireland (MAGNI), subject to an examination
                of the circumstances and factors which gave rise to this
                deficit. The sum of £1·1 million represents an accumulated
                deficit in recurrent funding, and the Executive have agreed to
                confirm the allocation of resources to that, subject to MAGNI
                and the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure agreeing a
                recovery plan with my Department and the Economic Policy Unit in
                the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister
                to secure cost savings and greater financial stability. This
                could involve re-examining the scope for rationalisation and
                centralisation of support services to see if the economies
                assumed when the merger of the three previous organisations was
                approved will be realised.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The balance of £0·8 million is needed for
                maintenance work at the museums. The Executive have agreed that
                we should confirm £0·5 million of this because some of the
                work needed is health and safety related and particularly
                urgent. However, the balance of £0·3 million will now be used
                for other purposes and has been taken into account in the
                allocations I am announcing today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Education is receiving
                funding for the education element of the north Belfast
                initiative. This will address the needs of schools and young
                people in north Belfast and help rebuild community relations.
                The Youth Service is also receiving funding, primarily to
                address health and safety issues and to meet urgent equipment
                needs.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.45 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I said earlier, the Department of
                Education has also bid for £5·5 million to enable the cost of
                threshold payments to teachers to be fully met in 2002-03. It
                has surrendered £13 million in the current year in respect of
                the same payments. This is largely a technical issue, and we
                have agreed that it is not necessary to set aside money for this
                purpose now as there is time for this to be covered from the
                February monitoring round or from routine end-year flexibility.
                However, to enable the Department to plan on a firm basis, we
                have given a commitment that funding for these payments will be
                allocated in 2002-03. This is a further example of how we are
                ensuring that in-year resources are being targeted at current
                priorities and pressures and minimising the amount of planned
                carry-over into next year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department for Employment and Learning is
                receiving an allocation of £3·3 million. This will be used
                mainly to meet the needs of the learndirect network following
                the closure of individual learning accounts. It will also
                provide an advance grant to the Lisburn Institute to overcome
                difficulties there.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Local Enterprise Development Unit (LEDU),
                in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment is being
                provided with £2 million to meet projected client claims and
                fund two new programmes. Elsewhere, the Department is
                reallocating funding originally provided for industrial
                development grants to assist industry in other areas where some
                inescapable contractual obligations have arisen due partly to
                the world economic recession and the impact of 11 September.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also an allocation for the
                Department of Finance and Personnel to cover the initial
                procurement and implementation costs of accounting systems to
                support a common approach to the provision of accounting
                services across all Departments. This will be more economical
                than developing separate systems for all 11 Departments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive have, as always, paid
                particular attention to Health Service needs, and they are
                acutely aware of the pressures which are causing such deep
                concern across the community. In recognition of that, we have
                decided to allocate £7·8 million primarily to meet cost
                pressures in health and personal social services. This
                allocation is in addition to the £8 million which we had
                already agreed to allocate to the Health Service and which Mark
                Durkan announced on 3 December when he presented the revised
                Budget for 2002-03 to the Assembly. Provision for that is now
                being made in this monitoring round. Taken together, these
                allocations will enable urgent medical equipment to be purchased
                by trusts, and they will meet costs arising from
                higher-than-planned levels of service activity, junior doctors’
                contracts and consultants’ payments, as well as address
                pressures in pharmacies, laboratories and domiciliary care. They
                will also cover a shortfall in trusts’ projected income from
                GP fundholders.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The funding will be of real and immediate
                benefit to those in need of treatment and care, but many people
                will ask why we are not doing more, especially when we have seen
                so vividly the scale of the problems being faced in some acute
                hospitals. At this late stage in the financial year only limited
                amounts of additional funding can usefully be directed towards
                addressing the most immediate pressures. The Executive have
                looked carefully at this and listened carefully to advice from
                the Minister, Ms de Brún. We need to understand better the
                reasons for the underlying problems in the Health Service, and
                we need to develop appropriate strategies to address them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While we need to respond to the particular
                difficulties that we are now facing, we must also actively seek
                long-term solutions rather than quick fixes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of the Environment is being
                allocated funding to meet the costs of producing the Belfast
                metropolitan area plan. It has also been necessary to add £14
                million to the Department for Regional Development’s budget to
                meet a range of unavoidable cost pressures in public transport
                and in the Roads Service and the Water Service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department for Social Development is
                being allocated £4·9 million to meet a range of pressures —
                most notably to cover a projected £3 million increase in
                applications for the special purchase of evacuated dwellings
                (SPED) scheme arising from recent increases in civil
                disturbances. This provides more tangible evidence of the
                financial and social cost, which is a direct consequence of the
                unrest that affects so many in our community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These are costs that we must meet. However, I
                am sure that Members agree that it is deeply regrettable that we
                should have to do so when there are so many pressing needs in
                our public services, especially in health, education and
                transport. To complete the allocations, an additional £0·4
                million is being provided to the Office of the First Minister
                and the Deputy First Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I explained earlier, these allocations
                largely represent the fine-tuning of estimated requirements
                across Departments. They are routine reallocations of spending
                power to move resources from where they are no longer needed, or
                cannot now be spent, to the emerging pressure points across
                departmental budgets.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to raise another issue. Several
                Departments submitted bids in this monitoring round —
                totalling more than £4·5 million — for interim funding of
                projects that will be seeking funding from the Peace II
                programme. To ensure that Departments had some latitude in
                judging what would and would not succeed under Peace II, the
                Executive had previously agreed to set aside £2 million from
                the Social Inclusion /Community Regeneration Executive programme
                fund to cover any costs that were met in good faith, but which
                in the end proved not to be recoverable from the Peace II
                programme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, Departments are now seeking
                resources over and above the £2 million currently available,
                which would be needed only if it transpires that the commitments
                they have made are not successful under Peace II. These bids are
                being carefully assessed to determine how much is likely to be
                required from our own Budget. However, the position is not clear
                at present, and the Executive have concluded that it would be
                prudent to make further provision to cover projects that have
                been funded by Departments in good faith, but which may not be
                funded under Peace II. Therefore we have set aside a further £2
                million from the Social Inclusion/Community Regeneration
                Executive programme fund for that purpose. This will leave much
                less for new projects from that fund in 2002-03.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will be able to review the position when
                the gap funding issue has been concluded and Peace II is fully
                operational. In agreeing this provision, I emphasise that
                Departments will receive allocations for gap funding only if
                they can show that the projects could reasonably have been
                expected to succeed under Peace II; this is not an open door for
                bids for general support to the voluntary sector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recognise that some projects will no longer
                receive funding. Those projects will have to seek financial
                support from other sources. Indeed, it was made clear under
                Peace I that projects should be one-off, stand-alone projects or
                that they should develop an appropriate exit strategy. Through
                the introduction of gap funding, the Executive have made every
                effort to smooth the transition to Peace II funding and provide
                a soft landing for projects that are not successful in receiving
                funding from Peace II. Future calls for funding will now have to
                be handled through the usual channels.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This monitoring round has provided some
                significant adjustments to expenditure patterns in this
                financial year. I stress that these are mainly routine
                adjustments, driven by revised estimates of requirements up,
                down and across a wide range of services. Members will ask why
                this round has continued the recent trend by yielding a large,
                though welcome, amount of room for manoeuvre. I expect the
                Assembly to question the effectiveness of our financial planning
                and estimating and to raise concerns about the level of
                resources being surrendered at a time when so many public
                services are facing real problems.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive share this concern and have
                agreed that some analysis should be made to identify whether
                there are any underlying causes for this pattern of
                underspending. With the benefit of that analysis, we will
                consider how best to address those underlying causes as we set
                spending plans for the period 2003-04 to 2005-06 later this
                year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must seek to improve our planning and
                estimating. It would also be desirable, and generally welcome,
                for Departments to have firm, longer-term spending allocations,
                which would enable pressures to be more easily addressed through
                effective management and re-prioritisation of resources.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a first step we need to ensure that our
                resources are allocated to the areas of greatest need, and we
                will be seeking to make further progress towards that goal in
                the forthcoming spending review. Our work on needs and
                effectiveness will be one element that will help to inform that
                process. The views of the Assembly and its Committees will also
                be an important influence on our thinking. However, we must be
                under no illusion: this will be an extremely challenging task,
                but one which we must address together if we are to fulfil our
                commitments and meet the expectations of the wider community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, the allocations I am
                announcing today on behalf of the Executive will provide real
                and immediate benefits to a wide range of our public services
                including health, education and transport. We have worked
                together to reach these decisions on the basis of a careful
                assessment of the most pressing priorities, and, in doing so, we
                have provided further evidence of our commitment to open,
                transparent and accountable Government.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I
                welcome the Minister’s statement to the Assembly on this the
                first of his monitoring rounds. The statement reflects the
                concerns of the Committee for Finance and Personnel about the
                extent of reallocations in each monitoring round, especially at
                this time of the year. Should priority areas such as health,
                education and transport not be receiving a larger proportion of
                the Budget, instead of so much going to some Departments that,
                subsequently, are not able to spend their allocations? If we are
                listening to the advice of Assembly and the Committees on
                priorities, the allocations should reflect that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s commitment to the
                analysis of the trend. Can he give us a clear commitment before
                the next Budget round that the process will be examined in
                detail so that we can see some of the benefits coming through?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Are all these allocations being monitored
                with regard to TSN moneys? There are question marks over some of
                the allocations and how the Departments allocate TSN moneys.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Chairperson of the Committee for
                his remarks. I assure him, as I attempted to do in my statement,
                that the underspends and surrenders that he referred to will
                receive the analysis that I promised. No matter how precise our
                planning may become, it is unlikely that every Budget bid that
                is determined in December will be met 12 months later, according
                to the exact terms under which the finance was allocated. There
                may always be overspends and underspends.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Underspends are welcome, because they make
                available finance, which can be reallocated to meet emerging or
                immediate pressures. I trust that Members appreciate that.
                Nonetheless, the scale of the surrenders, at face value, raises
                questions that I have committed the Department to address.
                Planning will be more precise as a result of the co-operation of
                the Committees — particularly the Committee for Finance and
                Personnel, whose advice we value in that regard. However, I
                doubt that we will ever reach 100% accuracy in planning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All Departments are obliged to ensure that
                their expenditure conforms to the framework requirement to
                target the social need that they have identified.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister to his first
                monitoring round. I note from his remarks that, whereas he
                started with a surplus similar to that of the Durkan years, he
                intends to reduce it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further to his remarks about the need to
                examine our budgeting procedures to ensure that they are as
                stringent as possible, does the Minister agree that that will
                have a further implication for the Executive programme funds?
                When departmental budgets were first shaved to create the pool
                for the Executive programme funds, there were howls of anguish
                — particularly from the Benches to my right. However, the
                Departments have been able to implement their plans under the
                rearranged budgets. That implies that the Executive programme
                funds have fitted comfortably into the scheme of things, and
                that they have provided a useful extra area of initiative for
                the Executive. Will the Minister comment on that? Alternatively,
                is he concerned that, in practice, the Departments have dipped
                back into the Executive programme funds to balance the books
                when their budgets have run short?</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Members will appreciate, the Executive
                programme funds were established primarily to assist the
                development of new policies and programmes and to improve public
                services in accordance with the priorities that were agreed in
                the Programme for Government. Their aim is to help the Executive
                to break away from established patterns of spending and to
                develop local solutions to local problems that are
                cross-cutting, where possible. On the basis of that policy,
                which is echoed frequently inside and outside the Chamber, the
                Executive programme funds generally have been welcomed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last April, £146 million was allocated in
                the first monitoring round, which covered 62 projects. Several
                of the projects involved Departments working in partnership. In
                addition, £31 million was allocated for student support
                services. A further £39 million was announced in December.
                Several of those were cross-cutting proposals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive consider the programme funds to
                be an effective means of promoting cross-cutting work and
                supporting initiatives brought by a group of Ministers working
                together. The Executive have decided, at this early stage of
                their implementation, to carry out a short review of the
                existing arrangements in order to ensure that the funds are
                working to best effect in delivering the Executive’s
                commitments and priorities. The review is in progress.
                Department of Finance and Personnel officials are due to appear
                before the Committee for Finance and Personnel on 29 January
                2002 to discuss the review.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In his statement, the Minister indicated that
                the Department for Employment and Learning made a successful bid
                for £1 million to provide an advance grant to the Lisburn
                Institute of Further and Higher Education. Can the Minister
                outline the nature of that grant? Is he aware that the North
                West Institute of Further and Higher Education in Derry is
                facing financial pressures that threaten to disrupt its
                provision of community education services? Has a bid been made
                by the Department for Employment and Learning in respect of that
                institute?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By the end of the financial year a deficit of
                around £1·1 million will have been created as a result of the
                running costs of the Lisburn Institute of Further and Higher
                Education. The recovery plan designed to enable the institute to
                regain financial stability has been agreed with the Department
                for Employment and Learning. The grant will temporarily provide
                the resources that are needed to enable a plan to be
                implemented. The sum awarded will be recovered from the
                institute’s grant in instalments over the next eight years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware of difficulties at the North West
                Institute of Further and Higher Education, as is my Colleague,
                the Minister for Employment and Learning. Her Department has
                commissioned consultants to ascertain the reason for the
                deficit. They will report by the beginning of February. The
                Department for Employment and Learning will not submit a bid to
                the Department of Finance and Personnel unless it is supported
                by a full recovery plan from the institute. In the meantime the
                Department is providing the means with which the institute can
                address its immediate cash flow situation by advancing its
                monthly grant. I assure the Member that the situation at the
                North West Institute of Further and Higher Education is being
                monitored carefully and a recovery plan is anticipated.</p>

                grant to the Lisburn Institute of Further and Higher Education.
                Does the Minister agree that the current monitoring round is a
                recognition of the Executive’s failure to make proper
                estimates and to get their sums correct?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have been operating for several years. In
                spite of that, something is seriously wrong, given that there is
                so much underspending while Departments remain under pressure to
                respond to the people’s needs. Nowhere is that more apparent
                than in the health sector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Health, Social Services and
                Public Safety has been allocated £7·8 million in this
                monitoring round. If health is supposed to be our number one
                priority, why has animal health been allocated virtually the
                same amount of money? Moreover, the Department for Regional
                Development has been allocated around £14 million. Does the
                Minister agree that health is not an emerging pressure, but one
                that has existed for several years?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Budgeting, monitoring and estimating are
                being carried out in entirely the wrong way, because we are in
                the same position, year in, year out. Allocations that are made
                as a &quot;quick fix&quot;, represent money badly spent. The
                Executive must get their sums and estimations correct. As we
                move towards resource accounting, the situation can only get
                worse unless something is done urgently to correct it.</p>

                receive that note of acclaim, but I accept it in the spirit in
                which it was expressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have met the Minister’s bids. As I said,
                £8 million has been made available, in addition to the planned
                Budget allocations that my predecessor announced in December.
                Almost £16 million from the current monitoring round has been
                made available to health. Those moneys are designed to meet the
                pressures that are identified by that Department.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Seamus Close casts a keen eye over all
                budgeting announcements. I am sure that he is fully aware of the
                scale of additional investment that has been made in the health
                sector since devolution and that next year’s health allocation
                will be almost 10% higher than the current year’s allocation.
                We are aware of the Department of Health, Social Services and
                Public Safety’s needs and are responding to them as they are
                identified.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Longer-term issues are being addressed as
                part of the Department’s strategic approach. We await the
                requirements that will arise as a result of that, and we will
                respond to them accordingly. I addressed Mr Close’s general
                point about the associated budgeting and planning in my response
                to the Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are analysing the pattern of underspending.
                We must recognise that circumstances can give rise to
                unanticipated underspends. In the past year, for example, the
                foot-and-mouth crisis placed particular pressures in one
                direction. Certain programmes for which expenditure had been
                anticipated were either delayed or put back indefinitely as a
                result of the clampdown on agricultural activity that ensued
                from the outbreak of the disease.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I too welcome the Minister to his new
                portfolio. I was taken aback by the large sum of money that we
                now surrender under the technical term &quot;easements&quot;. I
                cannot understand how matters related to non-recurrent funding
                have come to be classed as &quot;bids&quot;. I also declare my
                disappointment that over £3 million has been allocated to fund
                animal tuberculosis compensation, given the scandal that was
                pointed out by the Northern Ireland Audit Office that, to date,
                £21 million has been handed out in compensation. There are many
                questions on what is happening here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have serious questions about the
                information presented today for the first time in the section
                &quot;Bids Recommended&quot;. I am a member of two Assembly
                Committees, and I have not seen those bids until now. There may
                be an explanation for that. Under the heading &quot;Centre&quot;
                there is a recommended bid by the Department of Enterprise,
                Trade and Investment for Invest Northern Ireland and another by
                the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety for
                funding to provide medical equipment for trusts. That bid should
                have been scrutinised by the Committee for Health, Social
                Services and Public Safety. It should also have examined the
                £4·6 million bid for funding to meet hospital and community
                health pressures and the amount that it is planned to carry
                forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much as I have tried, I see no explanation
                for those recommended bids. That is no way to run the Assembly.
                There may be some explanation, but Members saw those bids for
                the first time today, without having had any time to see the
                broader picture and understand the pressures involved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that some bids will be non-recurrent;
                for example, the bid for £3 million for the SPED scheme in
                respect of people who have been intimidated out of their homes.
                Let us hope that there will be no such bid in the next round.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned that the facility for Members’
                scrutiny of those bids leaves much to be desired.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Farren:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for her questions and
                comments. I did point out that at this time of year our
                timetable is tight, so all the scrutiny to which the Member
                suggests the Committees are entitled may not be possible.
                However, the Committees can always keep in touch with
                expenditure in their Departments. In that way they can make
                themselves aware of emerging pressures and underspends to enable
                them to forecast likely situations. The pressures communicated
                to us in mid-December emerged over time, not in the day or two
                before documents reached the Finance and Personnel Committee.
                The Executive Committees need to look carefully at how they
                address spending issues. They should seek from the Departments
                information in respect of anticipated underspends and emerging
                pressures throughout the year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The timescale for December monitoring means
                that it is not possible to allow any more time. Perhaps we need
                to address that issue with the Committees to see if better use
                can be made of the time between the identification of the bids
                and the announcement of the decisions so that the information
                that the Member is seeking can be made more readily available.
                However, the period running up to the identification of bids and
                underspends must be looked at as well.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The allocation of £8 million to the
                Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety was
                announced and approved in the Assembly in December 2001 as part
                of the Budget proposals.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not normally take points of order during
                questions on ministerial statements. However, I sensed from the
                Member’s question that there was a query about the order and
                procedure of the Assembly. The proper context in which to take
                up the matter may be in discussions with the Chairperson of the
                Committee and myself, rather than with the Minister of Finance
                and Personnel. It may be that some of the Member’s questions
                are about information from Departments to Committees, rather
                than from the Department of Finance and Personnel to Committees.
                If that was the point of order, and if the Member wishes to
                raise the question with me directly, I will be happy to consider
                it.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I
                also welcome the Minister’s first address on the monitoring
                rounds. He said that underspends are welcome. However, the lack
                of explanation as to why these underspends arise is unwelcome.
                Therefore, I am glad to hear that the Minister will examine the
                pattern of underspends and whether the forecasting systems are
                effective in determining how those occur.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister’s former Department, the
                Department for Employment and Learning, announced a remarkable
                underspend of £51 million. Departmental officials told the
                Committee for Employment and Learning that they had reduced the
                underspend to £13 million. Aspects of that underspend left the
                Committee with many questions about issues such as New Deal and
                student grants.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is concerning to read that the Department
                for Employment and Learning is declaring only £13 million of
                those easements. &quot;Easement&quot; is a euphemism for
                carelessness or poor cost-effectiveness. Does the Minister know
                where the missing £38 million has gone? It is also concerning
                that there is no explanation of how the easements were reduced
                to £13 million.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a href="#top">TOP</a></p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Farren:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not recall any underspend on the scale
                that the Member quoted. In the September monitoring round, the
                Department surrendered £10·6 million, and £6 million was
                surrendered in December. We are working on the basis of that
                information, and I accept that those are the real figures.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important, when considering services
                that are demand-led, to appreciate that the prediction of the
                scale of demand from one year to the next — forecasting in
                December what the scale of demand will be next September or
                October — is not an exact science.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We do not know, for example, how many
                students will be accepted into higher education, so we cannot
                determine precisely the pressures on that budget. We cannot
                predict accurately the number of people who will avail of
                services such as New Deal; the context is set by the number of
                unemployed people. Recently, the situation has been generally
                positive, as the number of unemployed people has dropped
                considerably. There has, therefore, been less pressure on
                services included in the New Deal programme. However, the
                situation could change dramatically. To an extent, the situation
                is already changing; recent figures show a regrettable increase
                in unemployment. Pressures on the services provided by the New
                Deal programme are likely to increase, and we must bear that in
                mind. The Member did not take account of the particularities of
                the situation. He needs to look beyond the figures to find an
                explanation for the underspending.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I echo the Member’s welcome of the
                underspending. Underspend in one Department leaves money to I
                echo the Member’s welcome of the underspending. Underspend in
                one Department leaves money to meet pressures in other
                Departments. That is the object of exercises such as the
                monitoring round.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for his statement. This
                is his first monitoring statement, so I join with those who wish
                him well with his new responsibilities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister will not be surprised that I
                wish to ask him about the part of his statement that relates to
                his former Department. In particular, I wish to ask about the
                so-called advance grant of £1 million that is being given to
                the Lisburn Institute of Further and Higher Education, although
                that has been mentioned several times this morning. Is the
                Minister concerned about the perceived unfairness to other
                further education colleges that have managed to avoid running up
                such deficits? Is he satisfied that the Department for
                Employment and Learning’s financial monitoring mechanisms are
                now sufficiently robust to detect colleges and further education
                colleges that get into financial deficit at a sufficiently early
                stage — before that deficit reaches £1 million, for example?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was pleased to note the Minister’s
                response to the previous question. Again, there is a
                considerable easement in the spending on job programmes, such as
                New Deal and Jobskills, in the Department for Employment and
                Learning. This is partly, although not entirely, due to
                favourable labour market conditions. If unemployment rates are
                increasing with the effect that it is regrettably necessary to
                increase such spending again, the Committee for Employment and
                Learning hopes that the Minister will look favourably on these
                needs.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Farren:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for his questions. I must
                resist the temptation to answer as if I were still the Minister
                for Employment and Learning. I have to satisfy myself, as
                Minister of Finance and Personnel, that the financial
                requirements on the Department are robust and meet the criteria
                tests with regard to public expenditure. I am satisfied that
                that is the case. It is therefore not my responsibility to
                answer questions about other unnamed colleges for which the
                Department for Employment and Learning has responsibility.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.30 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this case, particular requirements have
                led the Department for Employment and Learning to make a bid on
                behalf of the Lisburn Institute, which has experienced
                pressures. As Minister of Finance and Personnel, I make
                recommendations to the Executive, and the Executive have agreed
                to provide those funds. I believe that the repayment
                requirements are justified and are part of the package that has
                been worked out between the Department and Lisburn Institute.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie has raised issues that other
                Members have also raised. All programmes within the Department
                for Employment and Learning, including those associated with New
                Deal and Jobskills, are demand-led, and the Department responds
                to the existing demands. When demands recede during the year,
                money then becomes available which had not been anticipated when
                the bids for those programmes were first made. It is appropriate
                that we reallocate those funds in the manner in which the
                monitoring round requires that we should. We should not point
                the finger at Departments and say that their planning was not
                what it should have been. However, we are examining the
                underspending patterns across Departments to see what lessons
                can be learnt and what advice can be given on budgetary
                planning.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate the Minister on his new
                portfolio. I wish to return to a point that Monica McWilliams
                made earlier. She referred to the description of a Department as
                &quot;Centre&quot; on page 3 of the statement annex under
                &quot;Bids Recommended&quot;. There is no Department of the
                Centre. There are references to &quot;Trust Medical
                Equipment&quot; and so on, which probably should be dealt with
                under the heading of the Department of Health, Social Services
                and Public Safety.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister is aware of the massive
                pressures on the Health Service. Given that the reviews and
                consultations on acute hospital services, primary care, public
                health and community care have identified the need for
                restructuring and serious investment, can the Minister assure us
                that he, the First Minister, the Deputy First Minister and the
                rest of the Executive will listen carefully to the requests of
                the Minister of Health, Bairbre de Brún?</p>

                on behalf of the Executive with respect to their general
                approach to business. Nonetheless, from my experience in the
                Executive, I would say that careful attention is paid to
                pressures identified by all Ministers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The concerns expressed by Members of the
                House, by the health professions and by members of the public
                are re-echoed in the Executive’s deliberations on matters
                relating to the Department of Health, Social Services and Public
                Safety.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are acutely aware of the pressures. When
                particular pressures are identified, to which we can respond
                with the resources available, we do so. The manner in which we
                have responded to the bids that have been submitted in this
                monitoring round demonstrates that, as does the additional money
                over and above that contained in the draft Budget that was
                identified and made available by my predecessor. The £8 million
                to which I refer was announced by Mr Durkan in December. To that
                we are adding almost £7·8 million. Therefore, a total of
                almost £16 million from the present monitoring round is
                available for health, which clearly indicates our concerns.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We wish to hear the longer-term strategy
                plans that the Minister will bring to my Department in the near
                future. Those plans will be considered in the generally
                sympathetic way in which the Executive have considered requests
                from the same Department since I have been a member of the
                Executive.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Ramsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat. I agree with the
                Minister’s statement, which says, as a first step, that we
                need to ensure that resources are allocated to areas of greatest
                need. He also pointed out that the Executive are aware of the
                pressures facing the Health Service. Although I welcome any
                additional money, the £7·8 million mentioned is there only to
                meet costs that arise from service activity and junior doctors’
                contracts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In his statement, the Minister pointed out
                that there is a real and immediate benefit to those in need of
                treatment and care, and he expects that many will ask why we are
                not doing more. That is my first question. Why are the Minister
                and the Executive not doing more to meet the pressures in the
                Health Service? Health is a priority in the Programme for
                Government and for the Executive. However, slightly less than
                10% of the allocated money is going to the Health Service, and
                that money is non-recurrent. Although I agree with the Minister’s
                previous answer, he did say that long-term planning is needed to
                tackle the Health Service’s problems. However, non-recurrent
                money does not allow for long-term planning. Does the Minister
                agree that that shows a need for an increase in the Department
                of Health, Social Services and Public Safety’s overall
                baseline figure?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Farren:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members need to appreciate the nature of the
                monitoring exercise and the response that is made to the bids. I
                have made the point at least once — perhaps more than once —
                that we have responded 100% to the Department of Health, Social
                Services and Public Safety’s bids in this particular
                monitoring round. We have responded positively to the needs and
                pressures drawn to our attention and the funding that is
                required to address them. We could not have responded more
                positively — we responded 100%, which is as positively as we
                can respond to any request.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the risk of repeating myself, the
                Executive have been sympathetic to health. To make the point as
                clear as figures possibly can, since devolution, which covers
                the period from 1999-2000 through to 2001-02, we have agreed
                additional allocations of nearly £290 million to the health
                budget. Next year, health spending will be some £224 million,
                which is almost 10% higher than the provision for the current
                year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those figures represent significant additions
                and demonstrate the importance that we attach to this particular
                area. However, we must recognise that additional resources
                represent only part of the solution. We must ensure that
                allocated expenditure is used to the greatest possible effect.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will be aware that we are carrying
                out a needs and effectiveness evaluation of health and social
                care in order to better understand what we are achieving with
                what we are spending. Given the attention that has been paid to
                health and health-related issues — and that will continue this
                afternoon — Members will recognise that there are no easy
                answers. At the end of the day, we have to live within the
                overall Budget, and the additional funding for health and social
                care means that we may allocate less money than is being sought
                for other areas of public expenditure — but we are doing so in
                recognition of the particular pressures and requirements that
                come from this fundamental area of public life.</p>

                scheme is targeted directly on the alleviation of distress in
                north Belfast? Does the statement represent the sum total of
                resources that are being targeted to that troubled area, or is
                there other money in the departmental budgets that is as yet
                unidentified? Does the Minister have a view on the likely amount
                of additional funding that may be required to address that
                fundamental problem?</p>
                <b>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Approximately £4 million has been allocated
                in this round to address issues arising from the situation in
                north Belfast. That comprises the cost of the package of
                measures announced by the First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister on 3 December, additional work to the roads in the area
                and additional funding for the SPED scheme. That money could
                have been used to address pressures in the Health Service, for
                example. However, I am sure that the Members who represent the
                area will agree that it is important to recognise that the area
                is considerably disadvantaged. This spending will bring some
                additional benefits to the local community, particularly through
                the measures that address community safety, infrastructure and
                education.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Budget provision for the SPED programme
                is £9 million, with expenditure to the end of November
                amounting to £8 million. To date there have been approximately
                187 applications, and the anticipated expenditure is now £12
                million. That additional provision will ensure that the Housing
                Executive can continue to assist those people who have been
                forced to evacuate their homes for security reasons, without
                taking resources from other areas.</p>

                million for public transport, roads and water. I also welcome
                the extra money allocated under Peace II for various categories
                of activity. Can the Minister confirm that some Peace II money
                will be allocated to gap funding for particular sustainable
                projects? How can the local strategy partnerships bid for extra
                Peace II money beyond their district council allocations from
                departmental money?</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Gap funding does precisely what the name
                suggests — it deals with the needs of particular projects that
                are likely to benefit from Peace II funding. It is to help
                projects cross the gap between Peace I funding and Peace II
                funding with as little difficulty as possible. I pointed out
                that the allocations within additional resources set aside to
                meet such projects would have to be carefully scrutinised. It
                may well be that some projects that receive gap funding might
                not become eligible for funding under the Peace II programme.
                Therefore, as my statement indicated, gap funding will provide a
                soft landing for such projects.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards local strategy partnerships and
                the funding to be made available for projects under the measures
                for which they will have responsibility, concerns have been
                raised about the allocations that are being made under the
                determining formula. Additional funding is available under
                measures in Peace II other than those for which the local
                strategy partnerships are primarily responsible. Concerns have
                been raised particularly in rural areas, but these are not the
                only sources of support for the types of projects that it is
                hoped will be promoted in the overall context of the Peace II
                programme.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also welcome the Minister to his new
                responsibility and wish him well. He has already clearly
                established that he must do his homework well when dealing with
                questions from my Colleague Mr Close. I trust that he will
                progressively improve his standards over the years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He has already indicated one thing in answer
                to other questions — that it would be helpful if he were to
                publish a list of the bids received as well as those
                recommended. For example, it emerged only in cross- questioning
                this morning that the bids from the Department of Health, Social
                Services and Public Safety have been met in full. It would be
                interesting for Members to see a consolidated list, rather than
                the items that emerge only through individual Committees.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, on the issue of health, the
                Minister referred specifically to the need for longer-term
                solutions and not quick fixes. How is that position compatible
                with the fact that while additional hospital and community
                health pressures attracted £4·5 million, the Department for
                Regional Development appears to be getting almost £2 million
                just for salary increases and wages and inflationary pressures,
                all of which should have been entirely foreseeable at the start
                of the year? Why can a Department that is not supposed to be a
                priority get such a large amount compared with the Department
                that everybody in the Chamber acknowledges is the priority?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I return to the point that I have made on
                several occasions — we have met the bids that we were asked to
                meet. If you meet 100% of a bid you cannot go much beyond that.
                The Department of Finance and Personnel was asked for a certain
                amount of money, and we met the bid that was made. Issues
                relating to whether the Department should make a larger bid are
                matters that might be taken up by the Committee. It is not for
                me to answer for a Department as to why it made a particular
                bid.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That goes for any of the Departments for
                which the Executive have responsibility. The answer to Mr Ford’s
                first question is &quot;Yes&quot;. We will put the information

                local strategy partnerships and the areas that have been
                slightly underfunded previously, does the Minister not agree
                that many of the other measures are dependent on the district
                co-ordination that was afforded through the district
                partnerships and now through the local strategy partnerships?</p>

                the Minister not admit that he has referred to the other
                measures whereby funding could be achieved, but the overarching
                district co-ordination of local strategy partnerships is
                important in ensuring that that funding can be accessed?</p>

                They were being rolled out when I had responsibility for that
                Department. It was anticipated that 30 or more would be in place
                during the year. It is more appropriate that my Colleague, the
                Minister for Employment and Learning, Carmel Hanna, should
                address issues related to the matters for which she has
                responsibility.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The involvement of the district councils and
                the social partners in local strategy partnerships should
                provide a role for those partnerships that would enable them to
                look at the general issues related to the development of the
                areas for which they have responsibility. While they may not
                have direct responsibility for allocations of other funding, the
                strategic role, which is captured in their title, would afford
                them the opportunity to look beyond the immediate allocations
                for which they have responsibility.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recently stressed the expectation that

              French Government to build a new airport in the area around
              Chaulnes in Picardy to serve Paris and requests the UK Government
              to consult closely with the French Government to ensure that due
              respect and honour are paid to the graves of those who gave their
              lives in the two world wars.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank my co-sponsors for tabling the motion.
              In June 1895 the last great Government in the Western World to
              exhibit all the characteristics of ancient aristocracy took office
              in England. For the most part they were great landowners and
              country gentlemen who regarded union with Ireland as sacrosanct
              and who proudly became the Unionist party to resist the attempts
              of Mr Gladstone to introduce home rule for Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They were extremely talented individuals. In
              that year the Marquis of Dufferin and Ava was British ambassador
              to Paris, and was well respected by the French. He wrote in his
              diary that besides reading 11 plays of Aristotle in Greek he had
              learned, by heart, 24,000 words from the Persian dictionary, 8,000
              perfectly, 12,000 pretty well and 4,000 imperfectly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1861 Lord Dufferin built the famous Helen’s
              Tower on his estate at Clandeboye outside Bangor, County Down. It
              was originally a gamekeeper’s residence constructed with the aid
              of labourers who were made destitute by the recent Great Famine in
              Ireland. It enshrines today the memory of Helen, the Dowager Lady
              Dufferin, author of ‘The Irish Emigrant’, who died in 1867 of
              breast cancer.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The tower is particularly beautiful, and it was
              immortalised by the great poets of the age. At the other end of
              the road that leads to it is the village of Conlig, where a little
              cottage stands in which William Sloan, my grandmother’s cousin,
              was born. At the age of 19 William joined the 11th Royal Irish
              Rifles. It became part of the 36th (Ulster) Division, which was
              formed from the Ulster Volunteer Force under extraordinary
              political circumstances.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first world war stands like a searing scar
              across the face of human history. Time had stood still since the
              age of Moses and the patriarchs, but the great war was to change
              that and the whole world forever. Following the outbreak of the
              war, the British Army raised 82 battalions in Ireland by the end
              of 1914, of which Ulster contributed 42. Out of 145,000 voluntary
              recruits from Ireland, Ulster contributed approximately 75,000. No
              fewer than 46,000 recruits were from Belfast, which stood second
              on the roll of British cities for numbers of recruits in
              proportion to population until the imposition of universal
              service.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition to the famous 36th (Ulster)
              Division, there were six battalions of the regular Army from
              Ulster, five Ulster battalions from the 10th (Irish) Division and
              five more in the 16th (Irish) Division. Inspired by old family
              traditions, many Ulstermen chose to enlist in Scottish battalions
              such as the 6th Black Watch and 4th Seaforth Highlanders, who also
              had a recruiting office in Belfast. These formed part of the 51st
              (Highland) Division. Others joined the Argyll and Sutherland
              Highlanders. There were also many Ulstermen in the London Irish,
              the Church Lads’ battalion of the King’s Royal Rifles, the
              Bantam battalions and the Royal Scots, Cheshires and Sherwood
              Foresters. Besides the recruits from Ireland, many men who had
              been born in Ulster were to be found in the Dominion troops,
              especially among the Canadians, with whom two Ulstermen won the
              Victoria Cross.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The advance of the 36th (Ulster) Division at
              the commencement of the Battle of the Somme on 1 July 1916, when
              they sustained 5,500 casualties, is perhaps the most memorable
              single episode of the war, and it stands as one of the finest
              displays of human courage in the history of mankind.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then, in September 1916, the 16th (Irish)
              Division entered the Somme battlefields with an equal display of
              courage at the battles of Guillemont and Ginchy. This division was
              mainly Nationalist in origin and included within its ranks many
              members of the National Volunteers, including 600 men of the
              Connaught Rangers from the Falls Road area of west Belfast, and B
              company of the 6th Royal Irish, which was composed exclusively of
              Derry Nationalists. In the first days of September it lost 200 out
              of 435 officers and 4,090 out of 10,410 men from other ranks among
              its infantry and engineer units. However, in doing so it gave
              Ireland a national character in Europe. It was the like of those
              men who made the Irish nation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the site of the advance of William and his
              comrades at Thiepval, a handsome memorial tower was erected by
              public subscription raised in the North of Ireland in memory of
              the officers, non-commissioned officers and men of the 36th
              (Ulster) Division, the sons of Ulster in other forces who died in
              the Great War and all their comrades-in-arms who were spared to
              return. The tower — modelled on Helen’s Tower at Clandeboye,
              where William and his comrades had trained near to his home —
              was opened on 19 November 1921 by Field Marshall Sir Henry Wilson,
              chief of the imperial general staff. On 1 July 1989, under the
              auspices of the Farset youth and community development programme,
              it was rededicated in the presence of HRH Princess Alice, Duchess
              of Gloucester. Veterans of the Great War, including the 36th
              (Ulster) Division, were accompanied to the ceremony by dignitaries
              and public representatives from throughout Northern Ireland, some
              of whom are present in the Chamber today. It is presently
              administered by the Somme Association, of which I am Chairman.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Every 1 July we go with the Somme Association,
              the Farset organisation, the Ulster Society and Thiepval Memorial
              LOL 1916 to visit Thiepval and the great memorial by Sir Edward
              Lutyens, on which William’s name is inscribed. On that day we
              commemorate the sacrifice of our loved ones who died for freedom.
              We do not seek to glorify war; rather we seek to see that it does
              not happen again.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To the mothers of Ulster we say &quot;Mothers
              of Ulster, do not grieve, for your sons lie together with their
              former adversaries in the bosom of a proud and noble nation; they
              are not now solely the sons of Ulster, because they have also
              become the sons of France.&quot; To the sons of Ulster we say
              &quot;Sons of Ulster, soldiers of Ireland, do not be anxious for
              we will never forget you.&quot;</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore it was with some anxiety that we
              learned that the French Government are planning to build a third
              airport in the Somme area about 130 km north of Paris to serve the
              city. The area of Chaulnes has been chosen for the airport, and
              there is speculation that the villages of Rosières, Vauvillers
              and Vermandovillers will be threatened, and with them the first
              world war British, French and German cemeteries in the area.
              However, the Commonwealth War Graves Commission tells us that this
              area was mainly a French area of operations in the Great War and
              that relatively few Commonwealth war graves could conceivably be
              affected. It is seeking further clarification from the authorities
              and will make strong representations to them should there be any
              proposal to disturb the graves. The French Government have, in the
              past, avoided the need to disturb war cemeteries when similar
              development has taken place. There is no reason to believe that
              they will act differently in this instance.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We understand from the French authorities that
              the perimeter of the final site is yet to be defined and that that
              is unlikely to be done until the end of February at the earliest.
              Before a final decision is made there will be consultations with
              all interested Governments, especially the British Government. The
              French Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin, has made a firm commitment
              on that. The French authorities say that they are anxious to
              respect and honour those who gave their lives for our common
              freedom. However, I have had numerous representations from worried
              constituents about this, and I hope that their fears will be
              unfounded.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One constituent raised the subject of the war
              grave in Belfast City Cemetery, where 350 memorial stones are
              currently in storage. That similar problem, though closer to home,
              also needs to be resolved.</p>

              Member will join me in doing so.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The events in France from 1914 to 1918 have
              touched the lives of all of us, irrespective of our political
              allegiance or aspirations. Anyone who has travelled through or
              lingered in the area between Paris and the Channel coast will have
              experienced the special aura that descends over that part of
              Picardy. The vast scale of the battles that raged with such
              ferocity in that area over 80 years ago is contrasted by the
              tranquillity of the graveyards which hold the remains of the men
              from the armies of France, Britain and their empires, as well as
              their opponents in the German ranks. Such was the scale of the
              slaughter and the impact on the survivors that the French
              Government granted the land containing war graves in perpetuity to
              &quot;those who rest forever in this earth.&quot;</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the proposed airport to serve Paris is sited
              in Picardy, close to Chaulnes, Rosières-en-Santerre and Lihons,
              it will create environmental and ecological change and will impact
              on those who live there today. However, it will also set a
              precedent by which the displacement of war graves will become
              tolerable; then acceptable; then normal practice. Those who have
              not spent time in Picardy may be unaware that even today, human
              remains, cap badges, items of equipment, shrapnel and items of
              ordnance are still found in the corn fields or turned over by
              farmers’ ploughs in a grim annual harvest.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any move to disrupt the tranquillity that
              pervades these last resting places must be opposed. The quest for
              a site for a new airport must proceed with the same sensitivity
              that accompanied the building of the high-speed TGV rail link
              between Paris and the Channel coast. If the site for a Paris
              airport were to lie across the mincer of Verdun, which is so
              central to the French psyche, I wonder what the reaction in that
              country might be? I trust that the French authorities will see how
              sensitive the graveyards of Picardy are to the British and
              Commonwealth psyche.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will complete my appeal by reminding Members
              of the benefits that have accrued to our society through the
              largesse of the European Union, which is based on the desire of
              the French and the Germans never to repeat the carnage of two
              world wars. Surely it is fitting to ensure that such sacrifices
              are honoured in perpetuity. The French Ambassador in London, in
              reply to my recent letter, underlined that his Government are
              still open to consultation with the UK Government, among others,
              prior to a final decision being taken on the site for the new
              Paris airport.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are eight potential sites for the
              airport. Given the air, road and rail traffic chaos that exists in
              the band between Paris and the Channel coast, surely the French
              Government will reconsider positioning an airport south of Paris.
              They once looked at the potential of an airport in the Chartres
              region; perhaps that idea should be revisited.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I urge the House unanimously to request that
              our Prime Minister and his Government consult closely with their
              French counterparts to prevent that precedent from being set. I
              remind Members that the war dead of many nations either lie in
              recognised graves, or appear on the rolls of honour to the
              missing. In many cases they still lie undiscovered in this sombre
              area. I read recently about Private Richard Clarke, who, 85 years
              after his death, was suddenly discovered and has now been laid to
              rest in an honourable grave.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will share one or two recollections of my
              stay in the village of Authuile, which is beside the Thiepval
              monument that carries the names of hundreds of thousands of Allied
              dead who have no known graves. In the graveyard of Authuile lies
              the body of Willie McBride — the same Willie Mc Bride referred
              to in the haunting ballad &quot;The Green Fields of France&quot;.
              In that cemetery, I met a young Dutch lady. She did not belong to
              the generation of either the first or second world wars. When I
              asked her why she was visiting that particular grave, she said
              that the words of the song had driven her to make a pilgrimage.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In those tear-jerking cemeteries in France
              there are posies of flowers placed by grandchildren who never knew
              their grandparents. The echoes of the war of 1914 and the more
              recent conflict from 1939 to 1945 still resonate throughout Europe
              and beyond. I ask that Members support the motion unanimously and
              to add their respect to the memory of the war dead.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr O’Connor:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. I had the privilege of
              visiting the Somme area in July last year. As has been pointed
              out, the area still yields human remains. It could be said that
              the whole area is a cemetery and should therefore be treated with
              due respect.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was nominated by my council to make that
              visit, and I went because my great-grandfather was killed in the
              Battle of the Somme. His name was John Stewart, and he was in the
              Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. I logged on to the web site of
              the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. Unfortunately, I did not
              know my great-grandfather’s service number, but I knew his name
              and regiment. I found that 17 people called John Stewart from that
              regiment were killed in the conflict. That shows the scale and the
              horror of what happened.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many people have hang-ups about going to the
              war cemeteries. They think that that war affects only one
              tradition. I visited the memorial at Thiepval and the memorial to
              the Irish Divisions at Guillemont. Like Mr Ken Robinson, I visited
              Authuile Military Cemetery. The area should be kept in a manner
              that shows respect for those who gave their lives in both world
              wars. When I went there I was shocked. I thought that the trenches
              would be hundreds of yards apart. However, at Vimy Ridge, where
              the Canadians fought — many of whom would have had roots in
              Ireland, North and South — some of the trenches were as close as
              I am to Dr Adamson, who is across the Chamber.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not want to take this point too far, but
              we now have an Island of Ireland Peace Park at Messines Ridge in
              Flanders, to which £100,000 was allocated in the December
              monitoring rounds. If we are truly interested in reconciliation
              with each other and with our past, it is time to move on and learn
              from the past. We must respect our shared past as well as our
              individual pasts. People say that those who died gave their todays
              for our tomorrows. We should give up our hang-ups of yesterday, so
              that we can all have a better tomorrow.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, the Irish Government should
              acknowledge all the Irishmen who died. Instead of the single posy
              of flowers that President McAleese sent to the memorial at
              Guillemont on the 1 July 2001, the Irish Government should
              properly acknowledge the men of Ireland who died in Flanders’
              fields believing that they were fighting for home rule.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion brought before the House
              by Mr Adamson, Mr Ken Robinson, and Minister Foster.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion, and I compliment the
              Members who brought it before the Assembly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly has been touched by the French
              Government’s proposal. Members read with disgust and horror the
              news that they are considering building a runway over war graves
              at the Somme. It is incredible that anyone could disregard the
              graves of the brave men who fought valiantly for freedom and
              democracy more than 80 years ago. However, press reports have
              indicated that such a plan is being considered.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The manager of the Somme Heritage Centre, Mr
              Billy Ervine, suggested that the site of the intended runway is
              not necessarily in the Somme itself, but along the Somme River,
              outside Paris, where the graves of the British, French and German
              soldiers who fought the 1914 battles are situated. The site
              contains approximately 60 graves of British soldiers. It is
              understood that some of those soldiers hailed from Northern
              Ireland, and it is almost certain that some were from the Ulster
              regiments. The proposed runway would affect thousands of dead
              soldiers’ graves.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The local press has indicated that a similar
              motion is to be tabled at Westminster. Some Assembly Members have
              dual hats — those of MLA and MP — and they tend to wear them.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Campbell:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Colleagues and I have tabled a similar
              motion at Westminster. There has been a remarkable degree of
              support among MPs across the divide. It is now a case of
              galvanising the opposition to the proposal.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for his intervention. It is
              encouraging that the motion has support at council level, at
              Assembly level and at Westminster level.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several hundred thousand graves across the
              world hold the remains of courageous local boys who went far away
              to fight a war for democracy so that we could enjoy our lives in
              relative peace. Some of those men died lonely and hungry,
              ill-clothed for the climate and a long way from home. Do we intend
              to honour their memory by building a runway over their graves?
              Some of us had relatives who were killed in the first world war. A
              small number of us had friends who were killed beside them at the
              Somme and elsewhere during the first world war. Northern Ireland
              is a small, close-knit country. When one of us is killed, each and
              every one of us is affected.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is why we support the poppy appeal every
              year, which started in earnest in 1921. The poppy has come to
              represent all that is good and, at the same time, all that is
              horrifying about war. Today it is the predominant image of the
              Great War. I know nobody who can watch with a dry eye the release
              of poppy leaves during the service at the Albert Hall on the night
              before Remembrance Sunday. Imagine that the only thing of beauty
              that those brave men — and many young women who served as nurses
              — could see in that grey and desolate landscape of carnage and
              inhumanity was that simple red flower. Poppies covered the fields
              when man’s inhumanity exploded into the world with a ferocity
              not seen in any period before the first world war.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The French Government now intend to build a
              runway on the cemetery where the Commonwealth War Graves
              Commission and the British Legion have endeavoured to create
              peace, solace and respect. The French authorities obviously do not
              care about the honour and respect that is due to their own
              citizens, since some French citizens who fought for freedom and
              democracy are buried there.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As one who has served in the armed forces, I
              know at first hand a little of what was expected of those men.
              However, I can in no way begin to comprehend how awful it was for
              those young men to see the bodies and to smell the mortality of
              men all around them. Through the enormous loss of life during the
              first world war, the armed forces were able to refine their
              strategies and develop more sensible — if that is the correct
              terminology — forms of warfare, instead of throwing men in front
              of guns and shells.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We owe much to those men, whether they were
              from France, England, Ulster or from the Irish regiments. They
              gave their all, and we must do something to protect their final
              resting places. We must petition the Foreign Office Minister at
              Westminster to intervene on behalf of the dead soldiers to protect
              their graves from the encroaching runway.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our only hope lies in the fact that, some five
              years ago, Eurostar had planned to run trains through the
              cemeteries. The company was persuaded to bypass the site and,
              therefore, honour all those who gave their lives. As a result of
              that, it is imperative that we get involved and voice our disgust
              and horror at the intention of the French to dig up our slumbering
              heroes. We must translate that disquiet into action. We urge the
              Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Office to intervene.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Battle of the Somme played a vital role in
              the history of our small country. Over 20,000 casualties came from
              what was then the entire island of Ireland. One poignant example
              is that of three brothers from Comber who joined up at the same
              time, were killed together at the Somme in one machine gun swathe
              and are buried together. That illustrates the impact of the war on
              families and communities — every village, town and city in
              Northern Ireland felt its effects.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is believed that the British Government sent
              the Ulster troops to almost certain slaughter, so the British
              Government should make amends. That is why it is important that
              the matter be addressed at Westminster in an attempt to prevent
              those who are buried in Chaulnes from being disturbed by what is
              called &quot;progress&quot;.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are many reasons for observing
              Remembrance Sunday in Northern Ireland. Many of our fellow
              citizens have been lost to the ruthlessness of terrorism. One such
              tragedy took place at the cenotaph in Enniskillen. On Remembrance
              Sunday we remember, as a nation, not only the dead of the first
              world war, but those whom we knew personally, and who were killed
              by undemocratic, ruthless and tyrannical terrorists who thought
              that they could get the state that they wanted by killing.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Eighty years ago, young men went to fight
              against exactly the same thing. Now, the bodies of some of those
              who died while trying to fend off the despotic German leadership
              of the time are to be moved to make way for a runway. If this were
              proposed in respect of a graveyard in east — or, indeed, west
              — Belfast, opposition would have to be expressed only once
              before the plans would be stopped in their tracks. It is
              imperative that we put a stop to the proposed runway by adding our
              voices of rejection as an Assembly and as a country.</p>

              compliment Ian Adamson on his eloquent address when moving the
              motion. As always, he was articulate and civilised in his remarks,
              and I thank him for that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nationalists and Republicans have always had
              problems with commemorating the first world war. Nationalists, and
              Republicans in particular, have felt that the war was hijacked —
              if I may use that word — by Unionism. In many ways, Nationalists
              felt that they were excluded from commemorating those who fought
              that war believing, as John Redmond did, that it would deliver
              home rule for Ireland. There is, and has been, an ambivalence or
              unease in Nationalism in respect of the remembrance of that event.
              There is also unease with the poppy. I do not want to discuss
              that, because it would be inappropriate to do so, regardless of
              how provocatively the issue may have been introduced.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We recall that many fought in the first world
              war. I do not mean to glorify war. Ian Adamson said that the first
              world war &quot;stands like a searing scar across the face of
              history.&quot; Indeed, it is a monument to the savagery of war, in
              which ordinary men, on the instruction of generals who sat in the
              background, were sent to their deaths like lambs to the slaughter.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From a Nationalist point of view there are many
              complexities, doubts and misgivings in that issue, not because we
              do not remember or think respectfully of those who died at that
              time but because of the political manner in which it has been
              hijacked by Unionism. General Tom Barry fought in the first world
              war and returned to fight in the war of independence for Ireland.
              Several of the Connaught Rangers were executed in India because
              they mutinied against the executions of 1916. My own grandfather
              went to war in 1916. The letter received said that Private John
              Kelly, aged 37, husband of Maria Kelly, of 4 Marlin Street,
              Belfast, County Antrim had died on 9 September 1916. He had come

              war because he followed John Redmond and Joe Devlin in the belief

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is a good point, but I talk about Ireland
              and would prefer not to get into that. Perhaps it is partly our
              own fault, but from our perspective the situation has been clouded
              by the way in which the matter has almost become the domain of
              Unionism, Protestantism or Loyalism. However, I think that Ian
              Adamson said that there were 75,000 volunteers from Ulster —
              46,000 of them from Belfast — and 150,000 from the other part of
              Ireland. The difficulty is not in respecting or remembering. It is
              that we as a community have been made to feel excluded.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Ian Adamson said, this is a monument to
              savagery. Many of those people went to that war because they had
              no other means of livelihood. Some went believing that they fought
              for the freedom of small nations. Others from the Protestant
              community believed that they fought for God, Ulster and the Crown.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a holy ground, as all graveyards should
              be. As such, they should not be desecrated. Significantly, they
              should not be desecrated by Governments. For that reason we

              considering their development plans for facilities such as the new
              airport in Paris, as formally agreed, the war graves be allowed to
              remain in their present locations, with due care and attention
              being given to them in the memory of those who are buried there.
              As other Members have said, we ask them to remember that the
              people who are buried there include German soldiers, men and women
              from all over Ireland and people from England, Scotland, Wales and
              Canada.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All too often in this modern and inconsiderate
              world it is easy to forget our past, to forget the tens of
              thousands of people — some of whom were only children — who
              made the supreme sacrifice in both wars. I hope that some day all
              of us, whether Catholic, Protestant, Nationalist or Loyalist, will
              acknowledge the contribution that those who died made to our
              future. I endorse Mr O’Connor’s comments about the Republic of
              Ireland. As he said, those people gave their tomorrows for our
              todays.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For years the Commonwealth War Graves
              Commission, with the help of French councillors and others, has
              kept the war graves in pristine condition. They have ensured that
              the fields around the graveyards, which were once battle areas,
              are preserved in an acknowledgement of those who fell in battle,
              never to receive the last rites or a decent burial.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As another Member said, we cannot allow such a
              precedent to be set for the destruction of, disruption to, and
              disrespect for that pertaining to the fallen of the two world
              wars. We must continue to oppose any such destruction in the
              graveyards in Rosiers and the other villages that were mentioned,
              which are now threatened — and there is another development plan
              for an area near Ypres in Belgium that we must worry about.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The graveyards, battlefields and pathways
              should be left for the many who come throughout the year to pay
              their respects to friends and family. I have visited such places
              several times. Even though I have only two relatives buried there,
              I remember the strength of feelings that the visits gave me and
              the impressions that they made on me. I would hate to see them
              desecrated in any way.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People with little knowledge of the subject do
              not need to travel to France for an initial impression. They can
              go to the Somme Heritage Centre and get the information that is
              crucial to gaining an understanding of the problem.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly must send a clear message to the
              French Government that they must alter their plans so that all who
              are interred in the graveyards may continue to rest in peace. It
              is essential that they pull back and pay their tribute to the
              fallen who gave their lives so that all of us, including the
              French, could have a future.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Death is the main certainty in life. It is
              important that Members recognise that today’s motion is on
              behalf of all who died, regardless of creed, background or
              tradition. It also reflects the attitude of those who went to
              their deaths.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I end with a quote from the poem ‘In Flanders
              Field’, which I hope will be remembered by the French Government
              and all involved in the final decisions.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Boyd:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion, and all true democrats
              should endorse it. The proposed plans to build an airport on the
              site of the Battle of the Somme are distressing, particularly for
              the families of those buried there — and that includes many from
              Northern Ireland — who are faced with the prospect of the graves
              of their loved ones being moved or disturbed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposed site for the new airport would
              involve clearing a large area and disturbing the graves of many
              British and Commonwealth soldiers. I welcome the assurances from
              the junior Defence Minister, Dr Lewis Moonie, that if the
              proposals seem to affect cemeteries containing British and
              Commonwealth graves, the Commonwealth War Graves Commission will
              firmly resist plans to disturb the war dead.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">More than one million soldiers were killed in
              the battle of the Somme, which took place between 1 July 1916 and
              19 November 1916. The small number of survivors of the battle
              firmly oppose the proposed airport. People who live close to the
              site also oppose the plans. Residents state that the airport would
              dishonour the memory of the thousands of soldiers buried in the
              area. A British cemetery, containing the remains of 20 soldiers
              killed in March 1918, also falls within the proposed airport
              boundary, as does a large French military cemetery, which contains
              six British graves.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposed site is the final resting place of
              about 100,000 British soldiers. Thousands of graves may be dug up
              to make way for the construction. It is vital that the Foreign
              Office and the Ministry of Defence intervene in the matter. The
              Somme battlefield has a special place in the hearts of the people
              of Northern Ireland. On 1 July 1916, the 36th (Ulster) Division
              lost 5,500 men at the Somme, and their supreme sacrifice must
              always be honoured with the dignity that it deserves.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 1 July 1916 alone, Britain suffered over
              57,000 casualties — the biggest ever loss in a single day.
              Between 1 July 1916 and 19 November 1916, British and Commonwealth
              casualties totalled 420,000, while the French suffered 200,000
              casualties. The Battle of the Somme has been described by many as
              &quot;hell on earth&quot; — <i>[Interruption].</i> We must never
              forget the gallantry and resolute courage of all those who fought
              in the Battle of the Somme. The words &quot;We will remember
              them&quot; from ‘The Ode’, the fourth stanza of the poem ‘For
              the fallen’, which is recited at remembrance services each year,
              have never been so poignant. I support the motion.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several years ago, on a visit to the Somme, the
              late Harold McCusker happened to be in the same group as me. We
              visited the Wytschaete cemetery, where there is a memorial to the
              16th (Irish) Division. Harold McCusker’s great, great
              grandfather served with the 16th (Irish) Division, and his
              headstone is in that cemetery. The late Canon Hugh Murphy was also
              in the group. He was a Roman Catholic priest who had served with
              distinction in the Royal Navy during the last world war. He took a
              service —<i>[Interruption].</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. I am not sure where the disruption is
              coming from, but it is very discourteous to the House. Mr Agnew,
              please continue.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Agnew:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The late Canon Hugh Murphy conducted a service
              at the cemetery. Dr Ian Adamson was also there. Presbyterians,
              Free Presbyterians, Anglicans and Roman Catholics attended the
              service. However, my lasting memory is that two councillors from
              Down District Council laid the wreath — one was a Nationalist
              and one was a Unionist. The Nationalist was a member of the SDLP
              and the Unionist was a member of the Ulster Unionist Party. The
              Nationalist was a member of the Ancient Order of Hibernians; the
              Unionist was an Orangeman. The Nationalist put on his Ancient
              Order of Hibernians collarette; the Orangeman put on his Orange
              collarette, and together they walked to the memorial to the men of
              the 16th (Irish) Division to lay the wreath. That is a lasting
              memory that I will have of all of the journeys that I have made to
              the Somme battlefields.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the conciliatory note in the House,
              and we should never forget that people of all races, all
              religions, both sexes and every walk of life lost their lives
              during the Great War. We talk about the 5,500 men who lost their
              lives, or who were wounded during the first two days of fighting
              at the Somme, and we should never forget the supreme sacrifice —
              the Somme took the lives of about one million people. However,
              many more millions — perhaps as many as 10 million — lost
              their lives in the Great War. Although I would never consider
              myself a pacifist, a visit to the Somme battlefield would be the
              one thing that might tip me over the edge towards pacifism. The
              deaths on those battlefields were such a terrible waste of human
              life, such a dreadful sacrifice. We hear much about lions being
              led by donkeys — that may be true. However, we must remember the
              supreme bravery and sacrifice of the people from Ireland, North
              and South.</p>
              <i>

              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I fully acknowledge the difficulty that
              Nationalists have with 1916 for all sorts of political reasons
              that intermingle in the Ulster story. We cannot ignore the fact
              that people from all communities and walks of life, North and
              South, lost their lives during the Great War. We should never
              forget their supreme sacrifice.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the aftermath of the war, we were told that
              the French had given land over in perpetuity to be used as
              cemeteries in Picardy, Flanders Field and Belgium. That land was
              to be a resting place for those who had lost their lives during
              the Great War, so that subsequent generations could visit and pay
              homage to them. I have a problem with the issue of &quot;in
              perpetuity&quot;; it must be resolved, and perhaps this is the
              ideal opportunity to do so. If that land was granted in
              perpetuity, why are we faced with the problem of the closure of
              the Chaulnes area in Picardy, where many soldiers lost their lives
              in particularly horrific circumstances?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those lives were not necessarily lost to enemy
              weaponry and warfare; many died in a very simple way. The soldiers
              wore heavy packs on their backs and the ground in that area had
              been churned up through the ravages of war. As a result, those
              soldiers, weakened by war, underfed and undernourished, sank to
              their knees in the mud and fell to the ground face down. Many of
              them drowned in a sea of mud in an area close to where it is
              proposed that the third airport for Paris be built.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion and congratulate my three
              Colleagues for tabling it. We must never forget the supreme
              sacrifice made, not only by Ulstermen and Irishmen, but by
              soldiers and people from throughout the free world. That supreme
              sacrifice has guaranteed freedom and democracy. We must always
              remember that.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. The issue is emotive, and
              it is important to Northern Ireland, Ulster, the whole island of
              Ireland and far beyond. I have been to the Somme battlefields on
              several occasions to pay tribute to those who fought and died. The
              remains of an uncle on my mother’s side still lie in France, and
              I have two other uncles who returned home from that terrible
              scene.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I say to Mr John Kelly that this issue is not
              about &quot;isms&quot;; it is about citizenship, then and now.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Shortly before Christmas it was brought to my
              attention that the French Government planned to build a third
              airport for Paris, which was to be situated in the Somme area. As
              a result, I wrote to the French Embassy in London and to the
              Commonwealth War Graves Commission to establish the facts and
              register my opposition to such a plan, if indeed it were the case.
              It goes without saying that I oppose any move to disturb the final
              resting place of the many thousands of Ulstermen, from both
              traditions, who made the ultimate sacrifice in the first world
              war, and who lie there side by side. They died in defence of
              freedom and by their actions helped ensure French liberty. It
              would be an outrage if the French Government were to permit any
              interference whatsoever with these graves at this particular time.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards local interest, there is greater
              regard in the Republic of Ireland now than ever before about the
              first world war. There are numerous associations there, and I am
              friendly with several people from the Royal Dublin Fusiliers
              Association who are thirsting for information about the first
              world war and are working hard to learn about what took place —
              who fought, who died and who gave their lives.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have received replies from the French
              Ambassador and the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. The
              Ambassador has assured me that the French authorities</p>

              said that even though a decision has been taken to build a new
              airport in the region, the exact location has not yet been decided
              and consultations are under way into a number of factors. He

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;proper consideration will be given to the

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;if it should prove necessary to remove
              some of the graves, extreme care would be taken to treat all human

              required, at an appropriate and accessible location…the cost
              would be borne by the French Government.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ambassador Bernard said that the French Prime
              Minister had given a firm commitment that before the final
              decision is taken there will be consultations with all interested
              Governments, especially Her Majesty’s Government. He concluded
              by saying that the French authorities and public</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;until the proposals and their
              implications are clear, the suggestion that Commonwealth War
              Graves will be disturbed is mainly speculation&quot;.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Significantly, the commission did point out
              that the area around Chaulnes, chosen for the airport, was mainly
              a French area of operations and considered that few Commonwealth
              war graves would be affected. However, while my primary concern is
              about the graves of those Ulstermen who fell, I would still be
              concerned if the last resting place of the men of any nationality
              were placed at any risk. That is vital.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The commission said that it was seeking further
              clarification and would make strong representations should there
              be any proposal to disturb the graves. It also pointed out that
              the French Government have, in the past, avoided the need to
              disturb war cemeteries when similar developments have taken place,
              notably the TGV fast rail link. It said that it has no reason to
              believe that the French will act differently in this instance. I
              therefore propose that the House should monitor the situation,
              offer support to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission and
              continue to press the French authorities to live up to their

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, and in memory of those who
              served and died, I will paraphrase General Douglas MacArthur when
              he referred to soldiers in another campaign. We did not know of
              the dignity of their birth, but we must respect the sacrifice and
              glory of their death and their last resting place. I support the
              motion.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One more Member will speak, and then Dr Adamson
              will wind up the debate. Rather than stop the debate and return to
              it after lunch, I am extending the time to allow Dr Adamson to
              speak.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Courtney:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion, and I congratulate Dr
              Adamson, Mr Foster and Mr Ken Robinson, for bringing it to the
              House today. We have had a detailed explanation of the history
              from our two historians, Dr Adamson and Mr Agnew, so there is very
              little for the rest of us to say regarding the historical context
              in which the Somme is regarded.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposed site is in the middle of a first
              world war Somme battlefield, and the new airport will involve
              clearing a large area and possibly disturbing the graves of many
              Irish, British and Commonwealth soldiers. If the plan is realised
              and the war dead are disturbed, it will be widely opposed, for it
              has already been said that more than half a million soldiers were
              killed at the Battle of the Somme between July and November 1916.
              The remains of at least 25 British soldiers and 41 Commonwealth
              soldiers will have to be exhumed and reburied if the airport gets
              the go-ahead.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The residents of Chaulnes oppose the scheme and
              say that the airport will dishonour the memory of the thousands of
              first world war soldiers who are buried in the area. The people of
              Ireland, North and South, irrespective of their religious or
              political backgrounds, regard burial grounds as sacred and,
              therefore, agree that the plan should be opposed. The Battle of
              the Somme in particular has great significance for the people of
              the North, both Unionists and Nationalists, and there has been
              real acknowledgement of the part played by the Irish regiments in
              both wars.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For that reason I know about the monument at
              Thiepval, which was first brought to my attention years ago by Ian
              Adamson. For the same reason, after many years of planning, two
              politicians from very different backgrounds, Glen Barr from my
              city of Derry and Paddy Harte from Donegal, a member of Dáil
              Éireann, collaborated in taking a team of young people to ensure
              that there would be a permanent monument to the war dead at
              Messines in Flanders, which was officially opened by Queen
              Elizabeth, the queen of England, by President Mary McAleese and by
              the Belgian king. That was a real watershed, which showed how the
              world wars, and those who gave their lives in them, are regarded
              by people, North and South.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The monument was opened by these three very
              prominent people, together with the relatives of the young men who
              had their short lives ended far away from home. For that reason we
              must oppose the plan to put an airport through the Somme
              battlefield. We must respect the memory of the dead and
              acknowledge the hurt that will be caused if the development
              proceeds.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like Dr Adamson I have also been lobbied by
              relatives, and at the end of last year I met with the deputy
              burgomaster of Messines and related the concerns of many people to
              him. He assured me that he shared our concerns and would bring
              them to his council and support our opposition to the plan. For
              that reason I am very happy to support the motion, and I hope that
              it gets the full support of the House.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Adamson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank everyone who has contributed to the
              debate. My co-proposers, Ken Robinson and Sam Foster, made several
              interesting points about Chaulnes and the Somme. Ken Robinson said
              that the land was given in perpetuity, which is true. The
              displacement of war graves must be opposed, or it will become an
              acceptable fact of life. Ken Robinson did, however, say that the
              French Government gave due sensitivity to the building of the TGV
              fast rail link, and perhaps that sensitivity will be seen in
              Chaulnes as well. But what if Verdun had been proposed as a site
              for an airport? Surely that could never have been considered in
              France. Ken Robinson thought that the Chartres region might be a
              much more appropriate alternative.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Danny O’Connor, who accompanied us to the
              Somme last year, spoke of his relatives and of the 16th (Irish)
              Division’s memorial at Guillemont. Of course, the whole area is
              a cemetery, which stretches as far north as Belgium, where the
              Island of Ireland Peace Park now exists in Messines. Annie
              Courtney spoke of that area, which was developed by Glen Barr and
              Paddy Harte through the auspices of the two Governments. Although
              the Irish Government could perhaps do more to acknowledge the
              first world war, they have already done a lot for the development
              of the Island of Ireland Peace Park.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Frazer Agnew spoke of Wytschaete near Messines,
              where our old friends Harold McCusker and Canon Murphy came
              together at the wonderful ceremony that we had there. Jim Shannon
              was quite distressed about the problem that surrounds the area.
              His Colleague, Gregory Campbell showed us that our colleagues at
              Westminster are completely involved in the issue. Westminster,
              this Assembly, the local councils and our European colleagues all
              have a part to play in preventing any desecration of sites in
              France.</p>

              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Campbell spoke of the great role of the
              Royal British Legion. The Royal British Legion has accompanied our
              Somme Association to France on every occasion, and has done much
              to help the veterans of the first and second world wars and other
              conflicts. We join Jim Shannon in urging the Foreign Office to
              take a strong attitude toward the French Government in this
              respect.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">John Kelly spoke of the problems that
              Nationalists have because of their feeling of exclusion. I hope
              that that feeling will eventually die out. On our first visit to
              the Somme we visited the grave of Willie Redmond — brother of
              John Redmond — who was really too old to fight in the first
              world war. When Willie Redmond was wounded with the 16th (Irish)
              Division, he was brought to a local first aid camp by members of
              the old Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF).</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The rights of small nations were very much a
              focal point for those Nationalists who went to France, because of
              the invasion of Belgium. I take great heart that Tom Hartley, a
              Sinn Féin councillor on Belfast City Council, now takes people
              round the first world war sites in the Belfast City Cemetery and
              Milltown Cemetery.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Eileen Bell has been one of the most loyal
              supporters of the Somme Association and has been to the sites in
              France several times. She spoke of her hope that the Irish
              Republic would take more notice of the first world war. She also
              spoke of another issue that will loom large in the following weeks
              and months — the development plans at Ypres, where the proposed
              motorway goes right through Passchendaele, where so many people
              fell. She gave a plug to the Somme Heritage Centre between Bangor
              and Newtownards, where you can see whole episodes of the first
              world war from both Unionist and Nationalist perspectives.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Norman Boyd said that the proposed plans were
              distressing. He hoped that the Commonwealth War Graves Commission
              would firmly oppose the plans. I feel that it will. We have been
              in frequent contact, and it promises to press the point
              completely. We must never forget the sacrifice that those men and
              women made in the first world war.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My friend, Sam Foster, has accompanied us
              regularly to France over the years — first as a councillor and
              then as an MLA. He spoke about the increasing knowledge in the
              South of Ireland about the first world war, and in particular the
              work of his friends, the Royal Dublin Fusiliers Association. I
              went to the Dublin Civic Museum to see its presentation a year
              ago. It was remarkable; the place was packed. I have also visited
              Drogheda to see the cross-border co-operation apropos the first
              world war that exists in that city.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is consensus in the House, among both
              Nationalists and Unionists, for this proposal, which I am glad of.
              In Helen’s Tower at Clandeboye there is a poem by Alfred Lord

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That this Assembly calls on the Minister of
              Health, Social Services and Public Safety to take immediate action
              to address the health crisis in our hospitals.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to make it abundantly clear from the
              outset that the motion is in no way intended as an attack on, or
              criticism of, the dedicated people who work hard and with
              professionalism at all levels of the National Health Service.
              Indeed, it is because of the pressures faced by the doctors,
              nurses and support staff in the National Health Service and, in
              turn, the negative impact on patients in Northern Ireland that the
              DUP sought the opportunity to debate the matter.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I pay tribute to all Health Service employees
              for the continued loyalty to their vocations despite the serious
              conditions in which they work. It is certainly not the pay and
              conditions, or the stress-free environment that encourages them to
              keep working in the Health Service. Without their dedication, the
              current crisis would be one hundred times worse.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Dickensian state of our Health Service
              shows no sign of improvement. Each time the issue is debated in
              the Assembly or elsewhere, circumstances have inevitably become
              more serious, and the crisis deepens. Some have described the
              current crisis as a &quot;meltdown&quot; of the National Health
              Service. We are certainly heading that way. Every possible index
              of the state of the Health Service illustrates clearly that
              deterioration, through the long waiting lists, the long hours
              worked by junior doctors, the number of trolley waits and the lack
              of community care packages.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note, sadly, that the Minister of Health,
              Social Services and Public Safety decided not to take up the
              genuine offer from Dr Peter Maguire, the chairman of the Northern
              Ireland Junior Doctors Committee of the British Medical
              Association, to shadow him at Craigavon Area Hospital. Had she
              done so, she would surely have had confirmed to her at first hand
              just how bad things are becoming.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It does not get much worse for the National
              Health Service when we consider the disgraceful acts of violence
              that took place at Altnagelvin Hospital at the weekend. That
              mindless and thuggish violence shows that National Health Service
              employees are under pressure from all conceivable quarters. I am
              sure that the House will want to record its disgust at that
              violence and the extra pressure that it creates for staff and
              patients at Altnagelvin, as it has done in other hospitals in the
              past.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It gives me no pleasure to state that every
              aspect of the Health Service, including staff morale, service
              provision and public confidence, reflects the same depressing
              reality that a crisis is upon us. Each time the National Health
              Service in Northern Ireland is examined and debated, we get the
              same vacuous response from the Minister of Health, Social Services
              and Public Safety. It amazes me to this day that she repeats the
              same old rehearsed excuse. How many times have we heard the line
              that it is the fault of the Tories?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is almost as if the last five years of new
              Labour had not happened. We cannot continue to blame the
              Conservative party for all our woes. We must look closer to home
              for some of the blame. We have to face up to the fact that a local
              Minister has been in charge of health for approximately three
              years, but rather than there being even a slight improvement,
              things are getting worse than they ever were under direct rule.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under direct rule we made the justifiable
              complaint that unaccountable Ministers were making decisions
              without consultation. However, we now have a local Minister who
              has consultations but who never makes any decisions. That must be
              addressed if we are going to stymie and turn around the decline in
              the Health Service. At present the Health Service is rudderless
              — it has neither direction nor any real strategic plan. The
              Department of Health has spent the vast bulk of its time reviewing
              the problems with the Health Service while delivering little
              guidance on how to move forward effectively. The Department, it
              appears, is permanently in review.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I noted with interest the Minister’s article
              in last Thursday evening’s edition of the ‘Belfast Telegraph’.
              She mentioned at least four reviews and strategies that have been
              commissioned by the Department of Health — the acute hospital
              review, the cardiac surgery review, the comprehensive review of
              health and social services workforce planning and the preparation
              of a regional strategy. While those areas need serious attention,
              one cannot help but feel that the Department and, in particular,
              the Minister are hiding behind continual reviews instead of
              bringing before the Assembly a firm and attainable blueprint of
              the way forward for the National Health Service.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much has been made of the lack of adequate
              funding for the Health Service in Northern Ireland. I am sure that
              the word &quot;underfunding&quot; will be mentioned many times
              today. Such is the importance of funding, or rather the lack of
              it, that I have personally raised this issue on numerous
              occasions, both within and outside the Chamber. The
              disproportionate and unfair nature of the Northern Ireland health
              budget, compared to that of our counterparts in the rest of the
              UK, is such that only the term &quot;second class&quot; befits the
              way in which the British Government treat us.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland has higher levels of need and
              demand than our English counterparts. We need to bear in mind the
              expenditure that is lost to the Health Service as a result of
              paramilitary punishment beatings and shootings. Those broken
              bodies require emergency treatment, months of nursing care and, in
              many instances, rehabilitation. Just think what we could have done
              with the millions of pounds that have had to be set aside because
              of that unacceptable behaviour.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We expected that funding would be, at least,
              matched with the rest of the United Kingdom. However, not only do
              we get less, but future increases show that we receive
              demonstrably lower funding allocations than England. If we were to
              receive the same rate of increase as England over the next few
              years, we would see the striking disparity between Northern
              Ireland and England. Had we matched their rate, we would have
              gained £83 million last year, £138 million on top of the draft
              Budget proposals for 2002-03 and £214 million more than the
              indicative allocation for 2003-04.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland is desperately underfunded by
              comparison with England and Wales. If our Health Service is to
              turn the corner, we must have fair, proportionate and immediate
              financing of the service in Northern Ireland. Moreover, it is
              vital that the money that is currently apportioned to health here
              be wisely used. The Health Minister has a budget of over £2
              billion. That is a good deal of money, but various interested
              parties have rightly queried whether that money is being used to
              best effect. The Assembly must address that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Areas of the Health Service are being
              dangerously ignored. There is no mention in the 2002-03 Budget of
              the proposed new cancer hospital at the Belfast City Hospital
              site. We ignore the issue of cancer at our peril; we need to bear
              in mind that cancer will overtake heart disease as the number one
              killer in the UK in the next few years. Therefore, I call on the
              Minister to pull out every stop to ensure that funding is secured
              for this centre of excellence for the treatment of all variants of
              this dreadful disease. Last year, 31% of eligible women had not
              had a cervical screening test in the previous five years, and 28%
              of women aged between 50 and 64 had not had a breast screening
              test in the previous three years.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we had had that additional money, proper
              health promotion campaigns could have educated our people, and
              many more lives could have been saved. Currently, cancer patients
              often have to wait too long to see a specialist: this delays
              diagnosis and treatment, causing anxiety and distress. Often
              people have no choice but to travel to Belfast for treatment
              instead of being treated locally, and this adds to their stress.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The absence of haematologists in the Western
              Board area forces patients to travel to Belfast. Last year’s
              resignation of a radiologist at Antrim Hospital caused delays in
              diagnosis. Attracting and keeping qualified staff remains
              difficult. Better financial support across the service would
              benefit many needy people.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Surely it is time for a radical overhaul of the
              direction that is being taken by the Department and its Minister.
              Members would agree that after three years in the post, the
              Minister must do more than say &quot;I know what must be
              done&quot; — of course, I refer to the title of her article in
              the ‘Belfast Telegraph’. It is not good enough that she should
              merely admit that she knows what has to be done. People in
              Northern Ireland demand to know what will be done, and when.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members are fully aware of the seriousness of
              the crisis. One does not have to be a member of the Committee for
              Health, Social Services and Public Safety to encounter health
              issues. Members in my party receive, day and daily, complaints and
              queries by letter, phone or in person about the state of the
              Health Service. In my constituency of Strangford, I have seen,
              more often than I care to remember, the frequent problems and
              deadly effects of the growing burden on the service.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members may have read in the ‘News
              Letter’ recently the terribly sad and disturbing story of a
              disabled constituent of mine who suffered from numerous illnesses.
              His wife and son are also registered as disabled. In October my
              constituent became sick — to such a degree that his family
              called for an ambulance, which took him to a local hospital. He
              was told that it was just his arthritis acting up and was sent
              home without further treatment. Over the next four weeks his
              condition worsened and on numerous occasions he begged to be taken
              into hospital for proper treatment. During the following weeks he
              was taken to hospital a further seven times by ambulance, and each
              time he was sent home. Such was his pain that the poor gentleman
              had to sleep sitting up at night because he felt suffocated when
              he lay down.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A local community worker came to hear about his
              situation and advised him to go immediately to the hospital and
              demand a more thorough examination. He did this on Tuesday 6
              November. On the same day, after numerous tests, he was told that
              he had no more than 24 hours to live. Tragically, the gentleman
              died the following day. His family are now left without a husband
              or father, all because of the pressure on staff and the lack of
              time to deal with him adequately. That tragedy symbolises all that
              is going wrong with our Health Service today.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many Members could probably relate as sad a
              story. I spoke recently to a radiologist from Belvoir Park
              Hospital who informed me that the machinery had broken down, yet
              again. That resulted in the cancellation of appointments and a
              backlog of patients who did not receive their treatment. In some
              instances seriously ill patients have been sent home from hospital
              due to the pressures on the system.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The words of Dr Peter Maguire reflect a sad
              reality</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We are on the road to nowhere. The Health
              Service is in tatters, and we must get our act together.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These words are an accurate description of the
              state of our Health Service. In getting our act together, the
              Minister must tackle the issues that strongly affect public
              confidence. One such example is the offer of an MRI scanner to
              Belvoir Park Hospital by the Friends of Montgomery House. That
              offer must be accepted, as to do otherwise would be criminal. I
              ask the Minister to undertake to find the necessary running costs
              to ensure the maximum use of this scanner by the patients at
              Belvoir Park Hospital. She must recognise that her framework on
              waiting lists has failed to deliver.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.15 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister’s review of acute services has
              run into the sidings and is far too costly. Her plan to abolish GP
              fundholding seems to have more to do with politics than patients.
              One has to ask who will be the losers from the lack of an
              appropriate scheme that would take account of the advantages
              gained through GP fundholding.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister was advised in the House that if
              circumstances such as an epidemic of the flu virus arose, the
              Health Service would face chaos. That did happen, and over 100
              beds in four hospitals had to close because of a viral
              gastro-enteritis bug. As a result, the waiting time in Craigavon
              Area Hospital was 36 hours, and non-emergency surgery had to be
              cancelled. Such problems are arising across the Province, and
              those waiting to be admitted to hospitals are being told that
              emergency-only treatment is available. I wait with interest to see
              how many patients were waiting to be admitted to hospital at the
              end of December 2001 — those figures are not yet available.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the light of the situation, the Minister
              needs to act in the following ways. First, it is time that the
              Minister listened to and respected the views of the Assembly’s
              Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety. She has
              failed to do that so far. It is time that she laid aside her own
              politicking and concentrated on health matters. Next, she needs to
              lay before the Assembly a commonsensical and realistic blueprint
              that will reflect the concerns of Members and the public. A firm
              grip needs to be taken on the £2 billion that is being spent by
              her Department. Instead of attacking the trusts, the Minister
              needs to get her Department into shape, and if that means
              downsizing and streamlining it, so be it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister needs to take a serious look at
              the number of boards and trusts and take the necessary steps to
              reduce their number. She needs to bring her recommendations to the
              Assembly’s Committee for Health, Social Services and Public
              Safety with a view to getting an agreeable working plan that will
              allow real money to be released to the Health Service. It is time
              that the number of administrative bodies and quangos were cut, so
              that money could be released to front- line medical services. It
              is only when the Minister and her Department resolve to tackle the
              issues in a determined manner that we will be able to build a
              better service. The current crisis will deepen if these issues are
              not tackled. Elected representatives cannot stand idly by and
              allow that to happen. We owe it to Health Service staff and to the
              patients across the Province to build a strong and durable health
              system. I call upon the Minister and her Department to provide
              vision and leadership to achieve that goal. If that necessary
              leadership is lacking, they will be judged accordingly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is much to be proud of in our National
              Health Service — many good and dedicated people make the best of
              a bad situation to provide a caring service. Members will agree
              that a root-and-branch change to the current set-up is vital for
              everyone’s sake in Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I call upon the Minister of Health, Social
              Services and Public Safety and her Colleague the Minister of
              Finance and Personnel to seek an immediate meeting with the
              Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr Gordon Brown, and press him for
              equality of funding for Northern Ireland. It is no longer
              acceptable that this country should continue to be treated less
              favourably than other areas of the UK. Just imagine the service
              that we could have if there were agreement on its future
              direction, and the means of achieving that goal, and if proper and
              adequate funding were found to finance it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I urge Members not to allow the debate to
              become yet another in a long line of health debates. If we do not
              act now, who knows what the service will be like when the next
              debate is heard. I strongly urge Members to support the motion.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for Health,
              Social Services and Public Safety (Dr Hendron):</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome this important debate, which has been
              initiated by Mrs Iris Robinson. Prior to making my main comments I
              will mention the money for the MRI scanner for Montgomery House. I
              have written to Mrs Christine Lynch about that scanner and about
              the fantastic work that is being carried out, and I hope that the
              Minister can find the funding for it. I appreciate the fact that
              the Minister is present for the debate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The chaos in the Health Service cannot go on
              indefinitely. Patients waiting on trolleys and the war-like zones
              in our major accident and emergency departments have to be sorted
              out. Patients are not cattle, to be cast aside until beds become
              available. The magnificent hospital staff, the doctors, nurses and
              allied workers, can no longer be taken for granted.
              &quot;Meltdown&quot; would be the appropriate word to describe the
              state of the Health Service if it were not for the dedication and
              resilience of the front-line workers, who are tired, frustrated,
              overworked, underpaid and whose perception is that they are
              undervalued.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My colleagues on the Committee for Health,
              Social Services and Public Safety and I have visited several
              accident and emergency departments to see conditions at the
              coalface of health delivery. The Minister, Ms de Brún, has
              inherited a situation in which the health status of the population
              is one of the worst in Western Europe. Although over 41% of the
              Budget goes to the Health Service, there is still considerable
              underfunding here by comparison with England, Scotland, Wales and
              other countries in Western Europe.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a crisis in orthopaedic and cardiac
              surgery. The level of staffing and facilities available for trauma
              and orthopaedic services here is the lowest of any NHS region in
              the UK. Waiting times for the treatment of fractures are
              appallingly long. Some people have had to wait for a week for
              treatment of fractures of the neck or the femur. When I was a
              medical student I was taught that such fractures required
              emergency treatment within 24 hours.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Waiting lists are growing. The latest figure
              was that 56,700 people are awaiting treatment. Recently, I was in
              Craigavon Hospital, as were several colleagues, and I watched
              young professionals and others work on the front line. Although
              there is a major problem with funding, I got the feeling that
              there ought to be more co-ordination of services between boards
              and trusts. Therefore, last Wednesday I proposed to the Committee
              the immediate establishment of an emergency task force,
              representative of doctors and nurses who work in the accident and
              emergency departments of our main hospitals, and senior
              administrators. I am pleased to say that the proposal was carried
              unanimously.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will note that I have called this a
              &quot;task force&quot; — not a review that will go on
              indefinitely. The task force will encourage a collaborative
              approach to accident and emergency services at operational level.
              It will join together the experience of key clinicians and senior
              nurses working in the acute hospital front-line service. It will
              produce its initial report within weeks.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a clear need for close work at
              operational level and for integrated planning at strategic level.
              There must be a more meaningful co-ordination of emergency
              services across the four boards and the relevant trusts. I could
              cite many examples, but I want to concentrate on two of them.
              First, the Causeway Hospital sometimes buys services from the
              Eastern Health and Social Services Board, when, perhaps, it could
              buy from the Western Board, which is not under the same pressure.
              Secondly, beds are sometimes available at Daisy Hill Hospital in
              the Southern Board, while Craigavon Hospital is bulging at the
              seams. There may be reasons for that that I am not aware of, but
              those facts were pointed out to me.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The current day take-in system between the City
              Hospital and the Royal Victoria Hospital should be replaced as
              soon as possible by a system of continuous take-in for general
              emergencies. There is great sympathy towards that idea in both
              hospitals. The Eastern Board, if not the Minister, should
              implement that. Each hospital should receive admissions from its
              local population and only those emergencies that require the
              specialist services provided only by the staff of each hospital.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Capacity issues must be addressed urgently.
              Priority should be given to hospitals that are consistently unable
              to provide enough beds for the general emergency treatment of
              local populations. For example, there have been great pressures on
              the Ulster Hospital and the Mater Hospital. The ability of
              hospitals to cope with emergency admissions depends on the ability
              of their primary care and community services to avoid unnecessary
              admissions and ensure timely discharge. However, the Minister is
              about to impose new structures on primary care. On 1 April 2002,
              the system of GP fundholding will be replaced by local health and
              social care groups. It is important to note that 90% of healthcare
              is delivered at the primary care level. Primary healthcare is
              available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. A year ago, on behalf
              of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety, I
              successfully introduced an amendment on the continuation of GP
              fundholding in an effort to ensure a seamless transition to the
              new structures of primary care. That seamless transfer has not
              taken place.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The new groups will be committees of the
              boards. Instead of moving towards a primary care-led Health
              Service, as was envisaged by the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, we
              are merely giving more power to the boards. We are going to get a
              top-down rather than a bottom-up Health Service. A golden
              opportunity to give the long- suffering people of Northern Ireland
              the first stage of a top-class Health Service is being missed. The
              British Medical Association has been making that point about
              primary care for some time — this is a golden opportunity, if we
              have not already missed it. This is a once-in-a- lifetime
              opportunity to get primary care right. Primary care is the base of
              the triangle. If you cannot get primary care right, you cannot get
              other services right — in particular, secondary care and
              hospitals. We want to deliver a robust, patient-focused,
              responsive and truly integrated service to local communities, in
              which the patients come first. However, it seems that we are
              introducing, instead, another layer of bureaucracy under the
              control of the boards.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate that this is a complex subject. I
              am not in the business of &quot;bashing&quot; the Minister or
              anyone else. However, I am in the business of doing my work as the
              Chairperson of the Committee for Health, Social Services and
              Public Safety. As someone with long experience of primary care, I
              believe that what is proposed for 1 April 2002 will cause massive
              problems across Northern Ireland. Health professionals say that to
              me. The Minister recently met regularly with many people, such as
              Dr Brian Patterson, the chairperson of the General Practitioners’
              Committee (NI) of the British Medical Association.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To ensure success, primary care groups should
              be driven from the bottom-up. Primary and secondary care services
              are independent, though neither can be looked at in isolation, as
              Maurice Hayes pointed out. His remit was acute hospitals. However,
              the Committee persuaded him to examine primary care also, because
              you cannot consider one without the other. The British Medical
              Association has sent to all Members a circular in which it makes
              some points about primary care. It says:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;It is important that proper foundations
              are laid at the beginning if not to miss a major opportunity to
              create the most effective primary care system, which would
              complement and help alleviate the pressures in secondary care
              services.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Significant extra funding must accompany a new
              integrated, collaborative approach to healthcare provision, if we
              are to bring about the necessary improvements across the community
              and hospital settings. Northern Ireland has higher levels of
              deprivation than Great Britain. However, historically, it has
              received lower funding for health services. During the 1990s,
              while expenditure on health and social services in Northern
              Ireland grew by 35% in real terms, the growth in England amounted
              to 57%. The figures from the comprehensive spending review for
              2001-02/2003-04 highlight a deteriorating situation. Given
              Northern Ireland’s well-documented poverty and historical lack
              of investment in health, it is unacceptable that it should not
              enjoy at least a pro-rata increase in line with that in Great
              Britain.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have an opportunity to get primary care
              right. The people of Northern Ireland deserve the very best, and
              that is what they should get.</p>

              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Robert Coulter:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I too support the motion and am glad of the
              opportunity to pay tribute, as Mrs Iris Robinson did, to the
              loyalty, dedication and professionalism of those who work in all
              levels of the Health Service.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Health Committee
              outlined the complexity of the problem. There can be no quick fix
              for it. As I said yesterday, it will take the very best
              co-operation among us all to look at the situation and to work
              together. We should not try to score any points at any level for
              ourselves. Rather, we should look at the tremendous problem in the
              Health Service and work together to rectify it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The debate gives us the opportunity to express
              the concerns of those who are worried about the situation,
              particularly those who are on waiting lists, those who are waiting
              to see a consultant and those who are beginning to lose hope that,
              when they are called, it will be in time to do anything about
              their problems.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One can only begin to imagine the concerns in
              the mind of someone who has been told that he needs a critical
              cardiac operation immediately, only to be told by a consultant
              that the operation cannot be performed for another year or 18
              months. His family are concerned about his condition. He rises
              every morning wondering whether it will be his last day on earth.
              He is waiting for a message to come, but he knows that it will not
              come in the immediate future.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Similarly, one can only imagine how someone
              with a cancerous tumour feels when he is told that he cannot have
              an operation for many months. As Members of this House, we must
              take that situation on board. We must critically examine the
              system wherein people are unable to have the treatment that they
              long for and require.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem is not centred on hospitals alone.
              When Dr Hayes began to consider his brief, we told him that the
              problem of acute hospitals could not be viewed in isolation —
              the entire system must be looked at. I am glad that Dr Hendron
              pointed out that if we do not get primary care right, then every
              other part of the system will be wrong.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Without repeating the eloquent comments made by
              the Members who have spoken, several points must be made. There
              should be directed finance at the critical points of the Health
              Service. If finance is not directed, it will become, as I said to
              the Minister of Finance and Personnel, &quot;confetti
              currency&quot;. It will blow in the wind and disappear. There will
              be no way to have accountability. It will not be possible to trace
              finance through the system.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should look at the contracts of those who
              work in the system. Doctors are one example. Hospital start
              courses for junior doctors are not in line with the take-up for
              postgraduate doctors. I am told that hospitals will employ doctors
              only on a one-year contract, because the hospitals must pay for
              doctors for the first three years. Therefore, after completion of
              a one-year contract here, doctors go to seek work across the
              water, in England or elsewhere. If we are to keep our doctors,
              that system must be changed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The contracts must be examined. Consultants’
              contracts should also be examined. Much of the problem is that
              people are either waiting to see a consultant or are waiting for
              the treatment that the consultant has prescribed. The existing
              contracts need to be reviewed and revised.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The training of nurses and the retention of
              nursing staff should also be considered. Recently it was my
              privilege to attend the graduation ceremony of the nursing faculty
              at Queen’s University, Belfast. It was impressive. One reason
              for that was the number of young people who, despite the
              difficulties in our Health Service, are coming forward to take up
              a career in that service. However, the stress they will face, the
              conditions in hospitals and the lack of morale among people
              already working in the system will result in many of those young
              people, after a very short time, going elsewhere to pursue their
              careers.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Buildings are outdated and equipment needs to
              be updated. But the most debilitating effect on those who work in
              our health system is caused by the apparent lack of decision by
              those who control it. I said in a previous debate that decisions
              are needed in the short term, not more consultations and more
              blame. If that &quot;mind change&quot; could be achieved — so
              that instead of blaming one another, each of us could contribute
              in our own way and could work together to the betterment of our
              system — decisions could be made in the short term to benefit
              those who are currently concerned and worried. To be told
              &quot;Yes, we are consulting&quot; is not much comfort to someone
              lying on a trolley in a hospital corridor. That person wants
              action, not words. I support the motion.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr J Kelly:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. It
              is interesting that Assembly Member Iris Robinson chided the
              Minister for politicising her role. No issue is more politicised,
              inside or outside the Assembly, than health, and the only reason
              for that is the Minister’s political position. That is the only
              reason, and most of the politicisation has been by the Democratic
              Unionist Party.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last Friday, an agricultural item on the BBC
              programme ‘Newsline’ compared our health with that of animals.
              I objected strenuously to the programme at the time, but I have
              yet to receive a satisfactory reply from the BBC. Health has been
              politicised because of the party to which the Minister belongs.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Every party had the opportunity to take the
              health portfolio when it was offered on the first day on which the
              Assembly sat. Each party in turn passed the chalice to Sinn Féin,
              who accepted it. I contend that Sinn Féin, and the Minister, have
              behaved in a very responsible, progressive and energetic manner in
              relation to health. She has attempted, despite the backdrop of a
              lack of financial resources, to address the problems.
              Unfortunately, the political sniping continues. A similar motion
              was debated two weeks ago. If that is not recycling and
              politicisation, I do not know what is.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Maguire met members of the Committee for
              Health, Social Services and Public Safety, and last week its
              members fulfilled their promise to him when they visited Downe
              Hospital. It was noticeable that no members of the DUP attended
              the Committee’s meeting with Dr Maguire and the executive of
              Downe Hospital — so much for their care for Downe Hospital and
              the extreme circumstances in which it finds itself.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been said before that health is an
              emotive issue — an issue that people play politics with.
              However, I am not going to play politics with it, nor is my party.
              We have a genuine concern, given our background as a socialist
              party, for the welfare of people in our society. We are not here
              to play the politics of the DUP.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People’s health is the central responsibility
              of the Government. If we have a Government here, they should deal
              with the critical issues of our time. It is interesting that
              Assembly Member Iris Robinson said that it is not just a question
              of funding, yet she wants the First Minister and the Deputy First
              Minister to meet with the British Chancellor of the Exchequer to
              ask for more.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also interesting that, although my
              Colleague Sue Ramsey and I proposed, in November, that the
              Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety should
              meet with the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, we did
              not receive a reply until last week — so much for the concern
              for the financial problems in the Health Service. So great is the
              Executive’s concern that they did not respond, as a collective,
              to our request for a meeting with them until last week. We are
              sick and tired of the political sniping over the health of our
              community — political sniping that extends beyond the Assembly
              into some areas of the news media as well.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are talking about the health of the people
              who live in our community. Health has no sectarian walls or
              divides because it affects all of us. If a person is sick, it does
              not matter whether he or she is a Prod or a Taig: everyone
              requires treatment for his or her illnesses. A fracture requires
              treatment; cancer requires treatment; and a heart condition
              requires treatment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must work together to form, as Joe Hendron
              mentioned, a cohesive and collaborative approach to the Health
              Service. It is wrong for people to sit on the sidelines, not
              participating in the Executive, still wanting the largesse of the
              Assembly and the largesse from the Good Friday Agreement, but
              ignoring their responsibilities to the Good Friday Agreement.
              Those people have little room to talk about the Department of
              Health, Social Services and Public Safety, or any other
              Department, given the disgraceful attitude of their party to the
              Executive and their neglect of the Executive and the Good Friday
              Agreement.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Dr Hendron said, the Committee for Health,
              Social Services and Public Safety has attempted to address the
              issue of health, with whatever ability we have, in a non- partisan
              way. The Committee has visited most of the hospitals in the Six
              Counties. We have met staff from all areas of the medical
              profession — midwives, nurses, consultants, junior doctors, and
              members of the British Medical Association (BMA). The underlying
              problem, according to them, is the lack of funding in the Health
              Service. There is no escaping that fact — however much others
              may wish to cover it up with calls for inquiries about where money
              went in the past. The Health Service needs funding, not only for
              crisis management but also for a health strategy. The Health
              Service needs a strategy that goes beyond the present crisis into
              next year, and the year after, and so on.</p>

              limit their speeches to eight minutes. I could spend 108 minutes
              on the subject. It has all been said before, so I will be as brief
              and to the point as possible.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Health Service is in crisis. It has been in
              crisis for a long time — since before Bairbre de Brún came on
              the scene. Many people are suffering unnecessarily, which is
              disgraceful and totally unacceptable. The crisis in the Health
              Service exists across the whole range of health provision. There
              is a lack of hospital beds; a lack of services for patients who
              suffer from a vast range of complaints; a lack of outpatient
              facilities; problems with regular and emergency treatment; and a
              shortfall in the provision of good quality care in the community.
              Vital drugs, which could improve the quality of life, are
              withheld, and the latest digital hearing aids, which could make
              such a difference to people with hearing disabilities, are still
              not provided free, despite the fact that Minister de Brún has
              asked for funding for that provision.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The crisis in the Health Service was fully
              debated just before Christmas. The Assembly and the Executive have
              now agreed that health is the number one priority, which, in
              itself, is progress.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept that the Executive and the Assembly
              have agreed that health is the number one priority. However, that
              was not reflected in the December monitoring round, when only
              £7·8 million was allocated to health.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept what Ms Ramsey says, and I hope that
              the Minister of Finance and Personnel will take that on board.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before Christmas, we fully discussed the lack
              of provision in the Health Service. The pressure to greatly
              improve services must continue. Members must continue to put
              pressure on. I appeal to all Members to forget about who is to
              blame. Now is the time for us all to band together, as Rev Robert
              Coulter has already said. We must work together to get the best
              possible services from the resources that we have, to give
              everyone decent quality healthcare — maternity care, primary
              care, hospital care and community care. Free nursing and personal
              care must also be provided. In that way, everyone can be assured
              of a quality health service from the cradle to the grave.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the extra money that was allocated to
              health this morning. It is not nearly enough, but let us hope that
              it will be used wisely for the benefit of everyone.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Watson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion, and I pay tribute to
              staff in the Health Service for their continued professionalism
              and devotion to duty. Once again we are discussing the serious
              situation in our Health Service — a service which has been
              thrown into further crisis.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not share the views of some Members who
              think that the issue should be put on the back-burner. This is an
              important issue that must be kept to the fore at all times until
              it is finally resolved. The crisis will not go away until we make
              serious decisions and take effective action to ensure the
              long-term future of the service and develop mechanisms to cope
              with the situation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the last debate, I raised specific issues
              about Craigavon Area Hospital Group Trust that have since come
              home to roost. The cries for help were genuine. They came from
              staff who have been working under emotional blackmail in the
              Health Service for many years. The crisis at the Craigavon
              hospital peaked on Monday 7 January, when 31 patients were waiting
              for beds. The situation was highlighted extensively in the media,
              and while it concentrated on the accident and emergency services,
              all of the hospital services were under pressure.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The trolley waits have been reduced —
              yesterday they were down to 17, which is still unacceptable. It is
              a stark reminder of the lack of capacity in the hospital, which
              presents an unsafe environment for patients and staff. That must
              be addressed. All medical, nursing, administrative, portering and
              domestic staff have worked, and continue to work, extremely hard
              in difficult circumstances to ensure that a high quality of care
              is maintained for all patients.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are currently 433 beds in Craigavon Area
              Hospital Group Trust. In 1993, there were around 600 beds across
              the trust, and about 200 in South Tyrone hospital. In the same
              year, the numbers of patients treated were as follows: 21,000
              inpatients; 76,000 outpatients; 36,500 accident and emergency
              attendances; and 2,138 deliveries. In 2000-01, there was a 23%
              increase in the number of patients treated. The total numbers
              treated were as follows: 25,886 inpatients; 130,161 outpatients,
              representing a 71% increase; 70,815 accident and emergency
              attendances, representing a 94% increase; and 2,567 deliveries,
              representing a 20% increase.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The increase in workload and the corresponding
              reduction in beds reflects the ability of staff to provide a high
              level of care in a rapidly changing environment. The Craigavon
              Area Hospital Group Trust is discussing a 10-year strategic plan
              with the Southern Health and Social Services Board and the
              Department. I urge the Minister to make a long-term commitment to,
              and investment in, Craigavon hospital, which plays a vital role in
              the delivery of acute hospital care in the south of the Province.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bed-capacity problems are evident across the
              Province, as the main hospitals do not have the beds, the staff or
              the resources to deal with the number of patients currently
              requiring treatment, which results in long and growing waiting
              lists. The main hospitals in Northern Ireland have the biggest
              demand for services. Sadly, only about 10% of the work in
              Craigavon hospital is elective or planned surgery. That figure is
              being reviewed weekly, with the trust carrying out as much urgent
              elective work as possible. However, some of the smaller hospitals
              have less demand for services and much shorter waiting lists. The
              pressure remains on the acute hospitals, and the problem has been
              well documented. The Minister must acknowledge that, with the
              limited capacity in hospitals, the necessary emergency work must
              go ahead as a priority, and other ways must be found to manage the
              planned work, and reduce the unacceptably long waiting lists. Many
              of my constituents would be more than happy to travel some
              distance to receive elective surgery at other hospitals that have
              the necessary capacity, rather than remain on the waiting list for
              Craigavon hospital.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A review of how elective work is managed across
              Northern Ireland is urgently needed so that the workload can be
              spread more evenly across all hospitals in the Province. Surely it
              is time for a closer working relationship to be forged between the
              management teams of various hospitals to ease the inequalities in
              access to the Health Service.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all know that the Health Service has been
              blighted by bad publicity. There are difficulties in recruiting
              medical and nursing staff, and many experienced staff are leaving
              because of low morale and lack of job satisfaction. That impacts
              on those who remain, and makes it difficult to sustain even the
              present levels of care. That needs to be addressed urgently if
              safe care and quality of care are to be maintained and improved.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was welcome to hear the Finance Minister
              announcing an additional £7·8 million today on top of the £8
              million that has already been allocated. However, there is no use
              throwing money at the Health Service during the year, because that
              is not a solution to the problem. We need significant long-term
              investment, and it must be equitably distributed across the
              Province. The Health Service must be properly resourced; managers
              need to know the level of available resources so that services can
              be properly planned, run and maintained. The Hayes review of acute
              services points the way forward for acute hospital care in
              Northern Ireland. Serious consultation and decisions on the future
              configuration of hospitals must be a priority for the Assembly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This problem affects all our people,
              irrespective of class or creed. It is far too serious an issue for
              political point-scoring. It is time that the Assembly stood
              together and got this problem resolved once and for all. This
              crisis is not acceptable, and the Health Service needs urgent,
              decisive action. I support the motion.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Morrow:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I too support the motion. The concern being
              expressed outside conveys the message to us all that all is not
              well in the Health Service. I suspect that during the Minister’s
              deliberations she will again remind the House that, in some way,
              the problem is not of her making. The continual distancing of
              herself and her Department from the problem washes very lightly
              with the general public. Whether it is of her making or not, the
              bottom line is that it is her problem and her responsibility. It
              is difficult to understand why we seem to be going from one crisis
              to another. If this were happening in a modern company, something
              drastic would be done.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the most fundamental and basic rights of
              any individual is access to a good healthcare system. However, it
              appears that when it is the Health Service, there seems to be a
              degree of complacency, indifference and, at times, neglect, to say
              the very least — I am trying to be kind. Some might find those
              words a bit sharp, but I did not create the perception. The
              perception out there is that no one seems to really care. It is
              the Minister’s responsibility to sit down with her officials and
              work out a resolution to the crisis in our healthcare system.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Every possible index of the state of the Health
              Service shows one thing; one word could sum it up —
              deterioration. From waiting lists to the hours worked by junior
              doctors, there is a continual deterioration. We, as Assembly
              Members and public representatives, demand to know why it is that
              way. The Minister continually tells us that the Tories did all
              this, and that it is of their making. My understanding is that the
              Tories are long gone, and some even say that they have been
              forgotten about. Others have made the bold statement that they
              will never be back. Who are we going to blame then? Has Labour not
              had a term of office? Has Bairbre de Brún not had a term of
              office? &quot;No blame at all to me&quot; she says — and, like
              Pilate, washes her hands.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During direct rule, the cry was always made,
              &quot;If we had a local Administration, we would make things
              different. We would make them hum. We would have a Health Service
              that was second to none, and we would make every citizen proud of
              the fact that local people had their hands on the local
              issues.&quot; Is that happening today?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Weir:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To be fair, would the Member not agree that the
              situation is different? Since the Minister took over, things have
              got worse.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Morrow:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sadly, that is true. Things are steadily
              getting worse, and soon they will be out of control. Without the
              professionalism of the doctors, the nurses — and the ancillary
              staff, I hasten to add — there would be chaos. The Department’s
              managers and the Minister must take note. They cannot continually
              stand up like Pilate and say &quot;Not our responsibility. We are
              not the guilty people.&quot;</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister has approximately 40% of the block
              grant at her disposal. She may say that that is not enough, and
              that may be true in some cases. However, if the Minister had
              enough money tomorrow, would she have a blueprint and a plan to
              put before the Assembly, the doctors and, more importantly, the
              patients in Northern Ireland? Has she got that blueprint to
              demonstrate in unambiguous terms that she is in charge of the
              situation? She will have to do better than she has been doing,
              because she convinces nobody. Whether or not the situation is of
              her making, she must stand up and say &quot;Look, this is my job.
              This is my responsibility. I am concerned.&quot;</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister’s continued running away from
              the crisis in her Health Service will not wash any longer. It may
              be a nice, convenient fig leaf to hide behind to say that the
              problem is somebody else’s. It is the Minister’s problem. She
              may not want it, and Mr John Kelly argued that anybody else could
              have had the Health portfolio. Well, nobody else has it. His party
              has it. He then boldly said that his party are socialists, yet
              they leave patients lying in wards, on trolleys and in corridors.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Conservatives did that, I hasten to add,
              those socialists would be standing outside every hospital with
              their placards. However, they are not doing that, because the
              birds have come home to roost, and now that it is their
              responsibility they do not like it one little bit. They do not
              like criticism, but a Minister should not be so gutless as to be
              unable to take criticism. Let the Minister stand up and take the
              criticism, and never mind the yobbo behind her who seems to be
              more interested in going down for a political rant. Some of us are
              very sincere about this.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recently visited Craigavon Area Hospital at
              the invitation of Dr Maguire, and I saw at first hand what was
              happening there. When the Minister and her officials decided to
              close South Tyrone Hospital, they were warned that Craigavon Area
              Hospital could not cope, because it was already at 90% capacity.
              What were we told? &quot;You do not know what you are talking
              about. We can cope. We can sort it.&quot; Are they sorting it?
              Tragically, they are not. Patients are being left for hours on end
              simply because of the overload that has come as a result of the
              closure of South Tyrone Hospital.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask the Minister to retrace her steps, reopen
              South Tyrone Hospital, especially given the current crisis. Let
              her demonstrate that she does care and that she is concerned. Then
              she will start to convince people that she has the stomach for the
              job that she is in.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for
              Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr Gallagher):</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the opportunity to discuss the recent
              health crisis. The public, who have witnessed the dreadful scenes
              in our hospitals in recent weeks and years want to see and hear
              about solutions. That also goes for the patients whom we saw on
              trolleys, for their distressed families — some of whom we saw
              interviewed — and for the harassed doctors, nurses and other
              health workers involved. The public do not wish to see an
              acrimonious debate in the Chamber, or attempts by individuals or
              parties to push around the blame.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The public know that there is a solution. They
              know that what needs fixing comes down to two issues — funding
              and management. It is as simple as that. As I said yesterday, in
              the past decade we have lost out in comparison to Britain by
              around £30 million or £33 million a year, yet its Health Service
              is in a beleaguered state. We must bear that in mind and figure
              out where we stand.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The funding issue requires a three-pronged
              approach. First, as has been pointed out, this Assembly must press
              the Treasury to make up some of the funding shortfall. Secondly,
              our Executive must take on board our key service’s priorities.
              At that level, additional money has been set aside for health and,
              already this year, approximately an extra £20 million has been
              directed towards our Health Service. It is encouraging to see that
              the Executive have some recognition of the problem.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, the Committee for Health, Social
              Services and Public Safety — and I am sure that other members of
              that Committee agree with me — relies on the Minister to make
              the case for more funding. We support the Minister. When we
              receive correspondence from the Committee for Finance and
              Personnel, we make our case. When we receive officials from the
              Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, we make
              the case again.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The other issue concerns management. Everyone
              knows that executives in the Health Service are highly paid, and
              some are not doing a good job. We have seen that they are
              repeating past mistakes. In the light of the scenes that we
              witnessed in recent weeks, it is time that they were brought into
              line. That is an issue for the Minister and her Department, and it
              is one on which I wish to see action taken.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">General planning in the Health Service could
              also be addressed in the short term. Last week, I visited the
              South Tyrone Hospital in Dungannon where I saw the empty wards.
              The accident and emergency department is open nine to five, five
              days a week. If that service alone were open from nine in the
              morning until 10 at night, seven days a week, less pressure would
              be placed on Craigavon Hospital. The public understand that; it is
              common sense. Our managers must be pulled into line about such
              issues.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also need a decision on the Hayes Report so
              that we can get a plan in place and into people’s heads.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Wide consultation has taken place. An
              independent and representative body was set up, which consulted in
              this country and beyond, and made recommendations. I hope that we
              will not be going into further consultation. The doctors and the
              hospitals realise that in the meantime, with the uncertainty that
              is generated, services are falling through the floor. They say
              that it cannot wait, and I agree.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We heard outside the Chamber that the First
              Minister and the Deputy First Minister, through their offices,
              refused to meet the Committee for Health, Social Services and
              Public Safety and that that has something to do with this problem.
              I do not agree with that view. There are lines of procedure: we
              have the Committee, the Minister, and the Office of the First
              Minister and the Deputy First Minister, and we should abide by
              those lines. Members of the Health Committee back the Minister of
              Health, Social Services and Public Safety in making her case, and
              the Committee expects the Minister to argue that case at Executive
              level.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will not argue that the Committee should
              bypass the Minister and go directly to the First Minister or the
              Deputy First Minister when it suits it. Regardless of what
              Committee I am on — <i>[Interruption].</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I supported the Chairperson’s exploration of
              that concept, and I am on record in the Committee as doing so.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have an Assembly that people have long
              sought, and there are procedures and ways of doing business. Let
              us all get behind those who are in key positions. We all have a
              responsibility to the public to deliver a proper and efficient
              Health Service and one that serves them well.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McFarland:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have heard a fair old tale of woe from
              around the Chamber. The Department must know by now that there is
              a crisis. The difficulty is that I cannot envisage action of any
              great detail to sort out the problems. Does the Department know
              where the choke points are? Where are the problems in the Health
              Service? On the one hand, £2·5 billion is going in at the top
              end, and on the other, patients on trolleys and overworked staff
              exist at the sharp end. That would indicate to any objective
              observer that something is wrong.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Health Committee tried to find out where
              the problems are. It examined the Health Service accounts to try
              to identify where the money was going and to track it down through
              the system. That was not possible. It tried to follow the audit
              trail, but, sure enough, the moment it got there the Department
              changed the headings, so it was impossible to identify where the
              money coming in at the top had worked itself out at the bottom.
              That remains to be the case.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If this were a commercial business, the
              managing director and the board of directors would have been
              sacked long ago. In its lack of clear action to deal with the
              problem, the Department reminds me of the old Soviet politburo,
              which was unwilling to countenance any change to, or any
              interference in, its affairs. It will review, consult, consult
              again, but do nothing.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.15 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department has a very bad relationship with
              the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety. It
              has been an unhelpful and reluctant colleague, unlike many other
              Departments’ relationships with Assembly Committees. It has
              adopted an arrogant attitude towards the Assembly. Members will
              have noticed the concern expressed in a recent report by the
              Public Accounts Committee about a reply it received from the
              Department of Health. In its reply to a comment made by the Public
              Accounts Committee that highlighted a departmental wrongdoing, the
              Department stated that it did not accept the comments. That
              Committee is the most powerful one in the Assembly. My colleagues
              in the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety
              will bear that out.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to re-examine the present situation.
              Let us look at primary care. The Committee Chairperson talked
              about the looming chaos, and why, last year, we gave the Minister
              and the Department a year’s grace to sort itself out and to ease
              in a better, simpler GP fundholding system. There has not been a
              dicky bird. There has been no movement, and what was brought
              before us last year has reappeared. I am concerned about the
              Department’s attitude.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have heard about patients waiting on
              trolleys in hospitals. The Hayes Report stated that 80% of
              patients in accident and emergency departments should not be
              there; they would be better dealt with in a primary care
              situation. Those who live near hospitals use them like a medical
              centre. We have known that for a long time. What action has been
              taken to clear the primary care patients out of hospitals, where
              they are gumming up the works, to allow the hospitals to function
              properly? There has been no mention of it at all. We heard
              yesterday about the amazing state of affairs in community care,
              which is gumming up hospitals from the other end.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Staff on the ground will say privately that the
              problem is as much a management one as it is a financial one.
              Health Service staff know where the problems lie, but they are not
              allowed to initiate change. They fear for their jobs and the
              system above them that will not countenance change. They are not
              empowered to implement changes that they know would improve the
              hospitals.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Health and the hospital
              managers need to remind themselves of the purpose of the Health
              Service. It is not an employment agency, nor is it a system that
              sits still. It is there for the benefit of patients. However, the
              patients will say that they do not believe that the present system
              works for their benefit. That cannot be right. We need leadership
              from the Department and the Minister and better management in the
              hospitals.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I urge the Minister to lead a drive to slim
              down bureaucracy in the boards and trusts. She must encourage
              managers to empower their staff to improve the effectiveness and
              efficiency of our hospitals. Then, perhaps, if the Department can
              identify where the money that the Assembly directs into the Health
              Service is going, we shall be confident that the Department of
              Health is effective and is hitting the target. I support the
              motion.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That debate took place on 11 December 2001; it
              was the last debate before the Christmas recess. My Colleague John
              Kelly and I tabled an amendment to that motion calling on the
              Executive to provide additional money. We are both aware that
              there are pressures not only on the acute sector but throughout
              the Health Service — from community care to mental health, from
              services for the elderly to those for young people. We discussed
              the situation during the debate on 11 December 2001 and in a
              debate on care in the community on 21 January 2002. On 11 December
              2001 all parties agreed to call on the Executive to provide
              additional money to target pressures in the service as a whole.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is regrettable that Tommy Gallagher has just
              left the Chamber, because he sought clarification on a point. The
              Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety wrote to
              the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister on
              16 November 2001 because it was aware that we would face a crisis
              in the service — in dealing with winter pressures, et cetera. We
              requested a meeting to discuss the years of underfunding of the
              service. Mr Gallagher states that he agrees with the decision by
              the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister not
              to meet with the Committee because he would see that as
              sidestepping, or bypassing, the Minister. However, the Minister
              wrote to the Committee to welcome its approach, because Committee
              members were going to support her bids. The Committee was visiting
              hospitals, and it witnessed the problems there. Its intention was
              to support the Minister’s bids to the Executive.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that Mr Gallagher reads my clarification
              in the Official Report. In my view the SDLP has now pulled back
              because the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First
              Minister does not want to meet with the Committee. Who is playing
              politics now?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee wrote to the
              other Ministers about the problems faced by the Health Service.
              One of the proposers of today’s motion, Rev Dr Ian Paisley, is
              the Chairperson of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural
              Development. Following on from Dr Hendron’s letter, would Rev Dr
              Ian Paisley and his Committee allow some of its Department’s
              budget to go towards alleviating some of the serious problems in
              the Health Service? It would be silly not to welcome the
              additional money that has been given to the health sector.
              However, it is non-recurrent funding.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Finance and Personnel today
              stated that the health sector faces real problems. Some Members
              said that health is one of the most talked about topics in the
              Assembly. However, the Department received a less than 10%
              increase in its budget in the December monitoring round. I must
              stress that that money is non-recurrent. One cannot talk about a
              three-, five-, or 10-year plan when the money received is only
              year-on- year and is non-recurrent.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Finance and Personnel also said
              that many people will ask why the Executive are not doing more to
              target funding in the Health Service. I want to ask that question.
              We are aware that there is a serious underfunding of the service.
              Health is a priority in the Programme for Government, but where is
              that priority when the Executive are talking about money?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a member of the Committee for Health, Social
              Services and Public Safety, I am aware of the problems faced by
              people working in the front line. I send my thanks to them,
              because they sometimes work in serious conditions. Last week we
              visited the Downe Hospital, where there are such problems. Staff
              there do a brilliant job, and we must congratulate them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have spoken to several people in the
              community sector who are concerned that money will be transferred
              from their funds to support acute services. The acute sector gets
              the big headlines. The community sector states that that has
              happened before, that we need to get away from it and that we must
              take a holistic approach to health rather than taking money away
              from one part of the service to give to another.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I make no bones about talking about the years
              of underfunding. Members have stated several times that this is
              not a funding issue, yet they proceed to attack the Minister.
              However, they rightly highlight the problems faced in their
              constituencies: occupational therapy issues; people not getting
              community-care packages; and people not being able to get access
              to wheelchairs. Members need to be aware that the funding of
              trusts is an issue.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members mentioned waiting lists, an
              issue that I raised during the debate on 11 December 2001. The
              Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety looked
              into non-attendance for hospital appointments, because a
              percentage of patients do not attend appointments. Waiting lists
              are growing, so we must ensure that people who have appointments
              keep them — otherwise they are just extending the lists.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What have the Executive done since the motion
              on the Health Service crisis was passed on 11 December 2001?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members said that we cannot go on blaming
              the Tories, who have been out of power for the past five years.
              When they were in power, the Tories stole £190 million a year
              from the Health Service — a service that they were against from
              the start. New Labour are not doing any better, because it is
              giving us the crumbs from the table while investing in the Health
              Service in England.</p>

              Members react when they are chided. John Kelly is a case in point,
              given his reaction to crucial health issues raised by my Colleague
              Mrs Iris Robinson and by Dr Hendron, Mr McFarland and Rev Robert
              Coulter. One certainty is that when the bait is put into the
              water, John Kelly always bites. However, he made some interesting
              points, which are worth repeating and studying when we get the
              Official Report. He said that the Minister’s political position
              is the problem — those are his words, not mine. Now that there
              is a realisation of the problem, perhaps they should do something
              about it. He is the only person in today’s debate who has said
              that he did not want it to take place because it is a recycled

              Ireland, as many have done, and speaks to patients, relatives,
              medical, nursing and auxiliary staff, one will find that the

              washing of the hands of blame is completely unacceptable. For a
              short period during the debate it appeared that the Minister had,
              for the want of another word, the moral support of the President
              of IRA/Sinn Féin standing behind her, but as the debate went on,
              he abandoned the ship, which appears to be sinking.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two weeks ago, I had the privilege of shadowing
              Dr Peter Maguire of the BMA in the Craigavon Area Hospital for ten
              and a half hours of his 22-hour shift. The invitation to accompany
              Dr Maguire was extended to the Minister, and I had to accept it,
              although the Minister should have been there to see the problems
              at first hand. It appears that the Minister could not look the
              medical, nursing and auxiliary staff, and the patients and
              visitors to the hospital, in the eye and tell them that her
              policies were working. I saw a Health Service not in crisis, but,
              in the words of Dr Maguire, in &quot;meltdown&quot;. People have
              been running away from that reality, and a holier-than-thou
              attitude of blaming everyone else is no good. The Health Service
              is staying together only because the tireless efforts by its staff
              are holding it together by the seams. Sooner or later that could
              give way.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Iris Robinson stated that the Minister
              should have visited Craigavon Area Hospital, because she should be
              aware of the situation there. I will remind the House of some of
              the things she would have seen, had she accepted the invitation.
              She would have witnessed stressed medical staff, overworked
              nursing staff, no beds available for patients and patients
              eligible for care in the community blocking beds. The Minister
              would have seen people giving their all to the Health Service and
              being given very little in return. She would have seen agency
              nurses willing to work as full-time members of staff but not being
              allowed to do so. In the intensive care ward I witnessed the sad
              reality of the lack of resources when one person was taken from an
              intensive care bed, put into a medical chair and told that he
              would have to be treated from there because the intensive care bed
              was required for a more urgent case. The patient was given a brass
              bell and told to ring it when he needed nursing attention.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Health Service has been brought to that
              Victorian state, and the Department is blind to that reality. I
              saw patients with nowhere to go, their dignity violated by a lack
              of privacy. I saw a public toilet being used as a ward toilet by
              patients assigned to trolleys in the corridors. I saw staff having
              to work their socks off in overcrowded conditions, where the
              movement of patients became an obstacle course along corridors.
              One emergency theatre had been turned into a makeshift ward.
              Perhaps the Minister could not look them in the eye and tell them
              that her policy was working, because it was not working then.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sick of hearing the old excuse — let us
              blame the Tories. That does not wash anymore. The responsibility
              is here, and we must ask where the allocated money is going. Each
              time money has been made available Members of the House have voted
              more and more resources to the Health Service — up to 40% of the
              block grant. Is the money not traceable once it goes to the Health
              Service, or is its impact not delivering the desired result? It is
              not a question of finance at that point, as some Members seem to
              think — it is a question of management. Management does not
              start at the bottom; it starts at the top, with the Minister,
              where it has failed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Carmel Hanna, who has now become a Minister
              herself, said in the ‘Belfast Telegraph’ that it is no longer
              possible to blame London for the problems, and I think that that
              is absolutely right, but you do not have to take a politician’s
              word for it. Take the word of the ‘Health Service Journal’.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It said that more money is needed. However, it
              is not the money that counts; it is the bureaucracy. In fact, it
              said that the management of the service is escalating the crisis.
              The ‘Belfast Telegraph’ article said that there was no point
              in blaming London for the crisis, because it is a crisis of local
              management.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 28 December a ‘News Letter’ article said
              that doctors and GPs were calling on the Minister to either do her
              job or quit. Those people are not members of the DUP, the UUP or
              the SDLP; they are health professionals. When those people make
              such remarks, it is time for the Department to buck itself up or
              else be put out. Until people realise that, the problem will go
              beyond meltdown.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the Assembly votes money to health —
              before Christmas it voted an extra £8 million for waiting lists
              — it does not appear to have any effect. Many Members have
              suggested prescription and improvements. However, people must
              realise that the Minister has failed. The Office of the First
              Minster and the Deputy First Minister must recognise that when it
              is invited to examine a crisis, whether it be foot-and-mouth
              disease or the problems at Holy Cross Primary School, it has a
              responsibility to let the people who are up to the job take over
              and sort the problem out.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Courtney:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Health Service faces a crisis of
              confidence. Every day we hear hardship stories of patients waiting
              for much-needed surgery. Despite the extra funding since
              devolution, the situation has deteriorated. For example, the
              number of patients waiting 18 months or more for elective
              treatment has jumped by about 700% in four years. Since March
              1996, the number of people waiting for outpatient appointments has
              risen from 59,000 to over 128,000. The total number of people
              waiting for a hospital bed has risen by almost 10% in the last
              year. Trusts’ deficits more than doubled between 1998-99 and
              1999-2000. All that happened despite extra resources.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A 7·2% increase in the budget was announced in
              October 2000; £17 million was allocated in November 2000; £14·5
              million was allocated in January 2001; and £18 million was
              allocated in February 2001. The budget for 2002-03 will be 37%
              greater than it was when the Minister took office. That is an
              increase of £687 million.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The North already spends a higher budget per
              capita, and a higher percentage of its Budget on acute healthcare
              than England or the Republic of Ireland. This is proof of the
              Executive’s and the Assembly’s commitment to the Health
              Service. However, the Health Service is about management as well
              as money. Arguments about the lack of resources should not detract
              from the need to manage the health budget professionally and to
              deploy resources efficiently. No matter how much we spend on
              health, we have a responsibility to ensure good management and
              accountability for how resources are used. Those lying on trolleys
              because there are no beds need to know that the money is being
              spent — if not on a bed for them — on something necessary.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is over seven months since the Department
              was allocated £18 million to address trusts’ deficits. However,
              it was not unconditional. The Minister must address the origins
              and consequences of the deficits. We need answers now. There is
              concern that some trusts were allowed to run up large deficits,
              while trusts that managed their budgets well suffered as a
              consequence. That has nothing to do with the amount of money
              available to the Department.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In autumn 2000, the framework for action on
              waiting lists, which was supposed to reduce the waiting list to
              48,000, was published, but there is still no report. We need
              answers to our questions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Throughout all healthcare facilities there is
              great disillusionment among staff, including surgeons and medical,
              nursing, ancillary and ambulance staff. Those people are at the
              forefront of care. The more hardship headlines they see in the ‘Belfast
              Telegraph’ — such as &quot;Elderly woman’s 22-hour wait on a
              trolley&quot; — the more concerned they become, because they
              must explain to the management why patients were waiting on
              trolleys.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree that funding is critical. However, as
              the Hayes Report states, while problems can be the result of
              underfunding, they can also be the result of not using resources
              efficiently and effectively. It is difficult to argue for
              additional resources for hospital and community health services,
              against other national and regional priorities, if it cannot be
              demonstrated that existing resources are being used to best effect
              by generally accepted levels of comparison. We need decisions on
              primary care, on acute care and, above all, on the administration
              structures in the Health Service. Staff are dealing with
              day-to-day crises, so they cannot, therefore, give the required
              time to strategic planning. The Department must take the lead if
              the situation is to be turned around.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reference has been made today to the violence
              at Altnagelvin Hospital during the early hours of Sunday morning.
              A similar incident occurred three months ago. Security was brought
              in at that time. Obviously it was not completely effective. How
              and why that violence occurred is part of the problem. We must ask
              ourselves why it happened. I believe that it is part of the wider
              deterioration of community structures. But whatever the reason is,
              the Assembly needs to take action. We need extra resources for the
              security that is necessary, if there is not to be a complete
              breakdown of staff morale. It has got to the stage where the Royal
              College of Nursing, which is not a militant organisation, is
              calling for strike action. There is a meeting in Altnagelvin
              Hospital this evening to discuss the possibility. The call for
              strike action is the ultimate weapon against the lack of staff
              security. The matter is critical, and I ask the Minister to make
              extra funding for the security that Altnagelvin requires a
              priority.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Health, Social Services and
              Public Safety has been allocated an extra £7·8 million in today’s
              December monitoring round. That is in addition to the £8 million
              that was announced on 3 December 2001. I recognise that there are
              many demands, such as junior doctors’ contracts and consultants’
              payments, and that there are other pressure such as laboratories,
              pharmacies and domiciliary care. However, a safe working
              environment is critical to delivering care. For that reason I ask
              the Minister to address that problem as a matter of urgency.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Next year’s health spending will be some
              £224 million pounds more than the current year’s. However, we
              must ensure that that money is used to the greatest possible
              effect — we want staff in accident and emergency departments to
              feel secure in their work and patients requiring treatment to come
              into a safe environment. This morning the Minister of Finance and
              Personnel stated that his Department is to carry out a needs and
              effectiveness evaluation. That evaluation is necessary to enable
              us to understand what we are achieving with what we are spending.
              The Assembly must restore confidence in the Health Service. In
              becoming a member of the Health Committee, I hope that I can work
              constructively for the betterment of the Health Service.</p>

              do not plan to speak for an hour.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I acknowledge the tremendous difficulties in
              the Health Service. I also acknowledge the Minister’s best
              efforts to get to grips with, and to plan beyond, the difficulties
              that she has inherited. I want to add my voice to the call for
              greater funding for the Health Service — in recognition of, and
              in response to, historic underfunding. Members agree that it must
              become the number one priority for the Assembly and the Executive.
              We must put differences aside in the interest of providing a
              proper Health Service for everyone’s benefit.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To depart from normal practice, I commend Mr
              Paisley Jnr for his initiative in visiting Craigavon Area
              Hospital. However, how much more powerful would that initiative
              have been if he had persuaded his Colleagues, Minister Robinson
              and Minister Dodds, to sit around the Executive table and add
              weight to the argument for more funding for the Health Service.
              That would be more meaningful and would deliver more in the long
              term.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is rich to hear a lecture from the
              Democratic Unionist Party on the Health Service when that party
              ducked choosing the Department of Health, Social Services and
              Public Safety when it could have taken it. Sinn Féin had the
              courage to go for it — in the person of Bairbre de Brún.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Barnett formula must be reviewed, with the
              objective of introducing a system that will address years of
              chronic underfunding. I speak from the perspective of Fermanagh
              and Tyrone. The Minister has met delegations from many hospitals
              and campaign groups that expressed people’s concerns and fears
              about the Hayes review — not least from the two counties that I
              mentioned. I ask the Minister to ensure the maintenance, where
              possible, of existing services at both the Tyrone County Hospital
              and the Erne Hospital, and the expansion of services where
              necessary. People in Fermanagh and Tyrone fear a running down and
              destabilising of existing services in such a way that one might
              easily slip over to the other. I ask for a bridge to the future to
              be built with regard to both those hospitals. I also ask the
              Minister to listen to the consultants and various campaigners whom
              she met recently.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is probably significant that we have debated
              the Health Service today and yesterday. It is something of a shame
              that both motions could not have been combined, as they are very
              much interrelated.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The public no longer want to see the blame game
              being played — they want to see some action. I want to hear
              proposals from both the Minister and the Member winding up the
              debate to solve the problems. I have listened to much of the
              debate, and it has been disproportionately heavy on blame.
              Previous Governments have been blamed; not just the Conservatives,
              but also the current Labour Government, who seem to be investing
              as little as their predecessors. The Minister has been blamed, as
              have other Ministers and the Executive as a whole. Proposals must
              come out of the Assembly, otherwise motions such as this will
              continue to be debated.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was worried to hear that medical negligence
              cases cost £27 million. That figure may go up, not down, if we do
              not start to tackle the crisis. I have received many letters, as
              other Members have, from consultants. We have previously
              mentioned, as has the Chairperson of the Committee for Health,
              Social Services and Public Safety, cases where patients have been
              passed through accident and emergency departments straight on to
              wards, where they are assessed for trauma. That happens because
              hospitals do not have the specialised or nursing staff in accident
              and emergency departments to do that. That is extremely dangerous
              and will increase the number of negligence cases in the future. If
              we are to save money, instead of currently pouring money in to
              prevent more of those problems arising, plans must be put in
              place.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was concerned to hear the Minister state
              yesterday that five sixths of all spending will go on existing
              services. That leaves one sixth for very little else. We must turn
              those figures around. I do not want to repeat what I said
              yesterday about the need to reorientate the culture of how health
              services are delivered. We must think about delivering intensive
              and acute care to communities.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have highly qualified and educated health
              and social services staff who are ready and waiting to do that.
              Most staff want to work within their communities. We must start to
              deliver intensive therapies and care in the communities. Other
              countries have proved that it can be done, as have some trusts
              here. I want to ask the Minister why, having looked at what
              services the trusts are providing, there is such variation in
              their plans. Some trusts are simply sending patients to be
              institutionalised and dealt with in hospitals, while others are
              beginning to introduce innovative plans to prevent bed blocking
              from starting in the first place. Equally, other trusts are trying
              to discharge patients more quickly. There is a notion that
              patients are moved out of hospitals quicker and sicker, but it has
              been proved that that is occurring less in Northern Ireland than
              elsewhere and that Northern Ireland is more able to cope with it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We ought to look at plans of that kind. Yes,
              infections are increasing, and at the latest update 156 beds were
              out of use, but we should be able to predict other things.
              Infections are unpredictable, but most of what we are dealing with
              in the Health Service is predictable. It is time to reorient it
              and put those plans in place. Let us not wait for reorganisation;
              let us put that plan and those proposals in place now.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This morning we debated our December monitoring
              round, and I am very concerned. There is no such thing as a
              &quot;Department of the Centre&quot;, yet it appears in the
              monitoring return. I asked that question over and over again. If
              it means the Executive, then that should be clearly stated. If the
              Executive say that they are holding back £40 million for a rainy
              day, why was only £8 million of that given to the Health Service?
              Of that, £3·4 million went on medical equipment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the moment we are hearing about staff
              shortages. Annie Courtney said that not only is staff morale being
              sapped, but that now staff are being attacked for their inability
              to get on with their jobs. Real safety precautions must be put in
              place to stop that. In addressing the recruitment and retention of
              staff, we must build up their morale.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, staffing has now become so
              dependent on agency staff that the permanent nursing staff are
              demoralised. Agency staff should not constantly be relied upon to
              make up the shortfall. I understand that the permanent nursing
              staff have been reduced by 43% since 1998. Something must be done
              about that. I understand that medical staff have not been cut in
              the same way, but clearly that must be addressed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am often concerned in discussions about
              hospitals, but if there has to be a bit of firefighting, we must
              also look at how we can prevent problems arising around mental
              illness, physical disability and learning disability. Sue Ramsey
              quite rightly said that money is constantly being taken from those
              services to deal with the problems in the hospitals. Those
              problems are genuine.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Concerning cancer, if the Health Service strike
              is discussed today, it is only fair that we should know what will
              happen with regard to all those patients with cancer who look for
              information about the new cancer unit on the Belfast City Hospital
              site. Also, I have just heard that once again the neonatal unit at
              the Royal Victoria Hospital has been closed to outside admissions.
              With 5,000 births in that hospital and 500 in the Downpatrick
              Maternity Hospital, we knew that a plan for a new centralised
              maternity hospital was needed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issues of cost effectiveness and cost
              efficiencies really must be taken seriously. A huge number of
              highly paid consultants sit around most of the time doing very
              little. Again, that service could perhaps be reoriented towards a
              midwife-led unit.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those very difficult decisions clearly will
              have to be taken. To close the regional neonatal unit for the
              intensive care of babies to outside admissions is a very dangerous
              thing to do, and it clearly causes concern. I suggest that the
              Executive examine the reorientation of some of the moneys that
              were surrendered. Out of £40 million surrendered, only £8
              million came out, and £3·4 million of that went on equipment.
              That left a very small sum of money — only £4·6 million —
              for the issues of staffing shortages and pressures. Those messages
              should not go out to disillusion people. There is £40 million,
              and the Executive must take it seriously. It is not only a matter
              of resources. It is also an issue of management, co-ordination and
              planning.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Weir:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To pick up on a point raised by Ms McWilliams,
              I must first express disappointment about cancer services. As late
              as yesterday, in a written question, I asked the Department for a
              date on which the cancer unit would be operational. The Department
              is still not in a position to provide that date. We need both
              certainty and swift action to ensure that people are cared for.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today’s debate is vital; it is difficult to
              find an issue that is more important to the people of Northern
              Ireland. Without indulging too much in the blame game, having been
              present for most of the debate, I am somewhat disappointed that so
              few Members have attended.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Suppose that a family doctor diagnoses that his
              or her patient needs an operation. That person is asked which day
              of the following week would suit for the operation. A telephone
              call is made to the hospital, and the arrangements are made for
              the operation to be performed the following week. That scenario
              seems extremely unrealistic; in fact, it would appear surreal to
              many people in Northern Ireland. However, it is commonplace in
              many parts of western Europe.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the long term, it is not simply a question
              of funding. Although I support the calls for greater pressure to
              be put on the Exchequer to bring Northern Ireland into line with
              the rest of the United Kingdom, we must realise that, as a whole,
              the United Kingdom has, for many years, lagged behind the general
              standards in western Europe. The level of gross domestic product
              that has been spent on health issues is well below the European
              average. Therefore, it is not simply a question of bringing
              Northern Ireland up to United Kingdom levels.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has either been a deliberate
              misunderstanding or an attempt by some Members to suggest that the
              motion is not about funding. No one has suggested that additional
              funding is not required for the Health Service. However, time and
              time again, Members have correctly said that it is not simply a
              question of funding. It may not be, but funding is crucial to the
              allocation of resources.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department and the Minister must accept
              their fair share of the blame. It is not simply a question of the
              Minister’s inadequacies; the crisis has also come about as a
              result of the apparently unaltered managerial ethos in the
              Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety. At worst,
              change is regarded as something to be delayed and, at best, as
              something to be avoided altogether. One wonders whether that
              Department treats original thought with the same contempt that a
              minister would treat the concept of original sin. It seems that
              there is a resistance to change in the Department.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although we are all agreed that we want to
              realise clichés such as pulling together and not treating health
              as a political issue, much of the blame must rest with the
              Minister and the Department. We need a Minister who will provide
              action, rather than consultations alone; we need a Minister who
              will deliver to the coalface of medicine, rather than produce yet
              another review.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several issues must be tackled. If, as was
              indicated, the preponderance of health boards and trusts needs to
              be streamlined urgently, one would hope that the Department would
              adopt a proactive approach and devise its own proposals. However,
              if it is either unwilling or unable to do so, the Executive must
              fast-track the review of public administration. I appreciate that
              a review of public administration is ongoing, but priority must be
              given to the health issues to ensure that results are delivered as
              soon as possible.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As was indicated by the Chairperson of the
              Health Committee and others, including Mr McCarthy, the issues of
              primary care and care in the community must be tackled. They are
              the key to the hospital crisis. Doctors tell us that too many
              people are unnecessarily admitted to hospital and that people
              remain in hospitals for too long because there are no beds
              available in the community. That has a knock-on effect on the
              waiting lists for acute hospitals and provision. I am not
              convinced that the proposals will benefit primary care.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is at the heart of the matter.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.00 pm</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Madam Deputy Speaker [Ms Morrice] in the
              Chair)</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also need rapid progress on acute hospitals.
              The Hayes Report states that too many hospitals deal only with
              acute services, so expertise is spread too thinly. Most doctors
              accept that that is the case. A better system would concentrate
              the number of acute hospitals and provide a secondary tier of
              services at community level. In my town of Bangor, a very good
              community hospital provides that level of service, thus enabling
              real medical resources to be put into acute hospitals.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Something must also be done urgently about the
              disillusionment of healthcare staff. Like others, I pay tribute to
              them. Unfortunately, to use a phrase that was first used in the
              first world war, &quot;lions are led by donkeys&quot; in the
              Health Service. Staff at the lower levels provide excellent care,
              but they are not given the help that they need from the top. A
              British Medical Association (BMA) General Practitioners’
              Committee recently conducted a survey of GPs’ opinions by
              sending a questionnaire to every family doctor in the UK. The
              findings, which were released a few weeks ago, highlight the
              dissatisfaction with the Health Service and the need to resolve
              urgently the shortage of GPs. One of the results of the survey
              shows that four out of every 10 young GPs want to reduce their
              working hours over the next five years, and most GPs in their
              twenties intend to retire early. That is a major problem;
              resources have been put into training people, but too many drop
              out because of poor morale. That issue must be tackled.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must make better use of technology. For
              example, more use of IT would enable medical staff to see, at the
              touch of a button, what medication a patient was on, what
              illnesses he or she suffered from and the results of previous
              investigations. That would save more lives, which is the ultimate
              test of any Health Service provision.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ways of screening must be improved to ensure
              that people who do not need to see a doctor do not use up time.
              More help could then be given to those who need it. That would
              also ensure greater mobility and would allow surgeons to spend
              more time in theatre performing procedures.</p>

              Few Members from the west have taken part in the debate; I wish to
              rectify that. Much of the debate has centred on management and on
              the roles of the Minister and the Committee. This is a
              long-running debate; it is a regurgitated debate. We are rehashing
              the same debate time and time again, a debate prompted more by
              politics than by health.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I mentioned in yesterday’s debate on
              community care, there is a history of destruction of the Health
              Service by the Tory Government, which dates from the 1980s and
              1990s. They made cuts of 3% a year, which left us to cope with
              years of underfunding in community, primary, acute, and accident
              and emergency care in all Six Counties. The responsibility for
              health also lies beyond the Department of Health, Social Services
              and Public Safety: all Departments must make the matter a priority
              or it will not receive the attention that is needed. Healthcare is
              very significant, and health problems are probably the worst
              problems that anyone must face. Health should therefore have
              priority over other departmental issues. The Department of
              Education and the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development
              have a role to play, and, in my part of the country, the state of
              country roads also affects health.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Health issues have a major impact on family
              income. There is a high unemployment rate in Fermanagh. Many
              people are forced to take low-paid jobs, and we have a growing
              elderly population. All those factors increase the pressure on
              local hospitals.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Food and diet also have an impact on health. We
              live in a fast food society, in which children eat a good deal of
              junk food, and such products are widely advertised. Drinks vending
              machines are available in schools, which encourages children to
              have a high-sugar diet. Those factors will have a massive impact
              on hospitals’ future costs. The effect of pesticides on food is
              a problem for the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.
              I mentioned that yesterday to the Minister of Agriculture and
              Rural Development, who said that there was nothing wrong with
              organic or locally produced food. However, I was referring to food
              that we import, and which is grown using substances that we banned
              years ago.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Drugs, alcohol abuse and smoking also affect
              health. Every day, young people watch people smoking on the most
              popular television shows. Such programmes advertise smoking as if
              it were going out of fashion — of course, we hope that it will.
              Government Departments, Ministers and others should lobby to stop
              such advertisements for smoking, so that young people do not
              succumb to peer pressure and begin to smoke, as smoking can have a
              major impact on young people’s future health.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The foot-and-mouth disease crisis and the loss
              of income in areas such as Armagh and Newry have had an effect by
              way of stress, depression, suicide rates, help to families and
              counselling. I raised that issue in yesterday’s debate on
              community care. Those factors affect health services, because, if
              patients do not receive early treatment, they may have to go to
              hospital, which results in very high costs.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Carmel Hanna was quoted earlier as saying that
              it is no longer possible to blame everything on London. However,
              London must be blamed for the amount of money that we are allowed
              to spend here every year. Members, and particularly those in the
              DUP, seem to be playing politics. This is a handy football for the
              DUP, which it will use to the best of its ability. Health does not
              seem to come into it — it is mostly about politics.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Areas such as Fermanagh have fared badly with
              the recently published document on the Noble index. Departments
              and Ministers should re-examine that document to see whether it
              has been rural-proofed and TSN-proofed. We are told that it has
              been TSN-proofed, but I do not believe that that is the case —
              it does not stand up to local scrutiny. Perhaps the entire
              document should be reviewed. If Departments use that document as a
              baseline — and it would seem that that they do — rural areas
              will lose out badly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Responsibility for access to healthcare and
              acute care services falls under the remit of Peter Robinson and
              the Department for Regional Development. Roads are very much a
              part of any debate on the Hayes Review and the reconfiguration of
              hospitals. In fact, access to services is more important than the
              hospitals themselves, and that issue must be dealt with. From the
              recent plans published for roads, it seems that most of the
              funding will be sucked into the Belfast metropolitan area, while
              other areas will receive no funding.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Barry McElduff mentioned the Hayes Report,
              which is vital to the future of hospital configurations in the Six
              Counties. We must include the border areas in those configurations
              too. A large geographical area running from Monaghan to Sligo, and
              including Tyrone, Fermanagh and Cavan, could be left with no acute
              healthcare services if both sides do not work together to ensure
              the provision of vital health services.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to get value for money from the Hayes
              review, and it must be implemented. Tyrone and Fermanagh need
              acute services and primary care — both areas must be looked
              after, and we need decisions as soon as possible.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am disturbed that the Committee and the
              Department are at such extreme odds — or so it seems from this
              debate. That is not a healthy situation. It is not good for the
              health of the people, and is not a great way of going forward.
              They have to find a consensus. Is there enough money? Are we doing
              the right things? Are we getting it right, and are we going
              forward in the next number of years to put things right? Go raibh

              both work in tandem. Will this debate end without any action being
              taken, or will steps be taken to address the issue?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Anyone who reads the provincial or local papers
              before or after Christmas will be aware of specific cases where
              people have not received the service that they should have done.
              The Health Service is failing to deliver for them. The demands on
              the Health Service continue to increase, and the system is
              crumbling at the edges. Indeed, my Colleague Mr Paisley Jnr said
              that the Health Service is showing signs of meltdown. That is what
              we believe to be the seriousness of the situation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all have constituents coming each and every
              day to our advice centres, phoning our homes and speaking to us on
              the streets. They tell us their horror stories of delays, long
              waits for operations, and a Health Service that cannot cope.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Accusations have been made in this debate that
              the DUP is being partial. I have a Roman Catholic constituent who
              has had cancer. She is fortunate that the cancer is in remission,
              but as a consequence she has bowel trouble. Her GP said that it
              would be terrible if the cancer came back and referred her to the
              hospital. She got a card to say that she would be seen in seven
              months. That is not an isolated case — it goes on and on. As
              Members of Parliament, and Members of this House, we have a
              responsibility to those people to highlight their cases.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When one of my Colleagues, Mr Campbell, banned
              sheep grazing in the Mournes because of cryptosporidium, Members
              called for his resignation. Now, when these problems are happening
              in the Health Service, criticism of both the Minister and the
              Department should be legitimate. We have been told that the
              Committee and the Department are at loggerheads, so something must
              be drastically wrong.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the leader of my party for his
              intervention. We all could recount similar cases of people who,
              irrespective of their affiliation or political opinion, have come
              to us for help. That is our job as elected representatives.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I pay tribute to the doctors, nurses, and the
              ancillary staff. They are the unsung heroes who try to do their
              best in very difficult circumstances.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.15 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to highlight waiting lists, as they are
              a good indicator of what is happening. The waiting lists for
              orthopaedic speciality — not operations, just appointments —
              are interesting: 1,271 people have been waiting between one and 11
              months, while 13,053 people have been waiting between 12 and 24
              months or more.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The waiting list for surgery is horrendous.
              Almost 15,000 people are waiting for general surgery; 1,500 have
              been waiting for more than 24 months; 629 people are waiting for
              neurosurgery, 266 for 11 months and 353 for more than 24 months.
              It goes on and on. Two thousand five hundred people are waiting
              for plastic surgery, and 549 are waiting for cardiac operations.
              Almost 50,000 people in the Province are waiting for operations.
              That is a health system failing to deliver; that is a Department
              in chaos and disarray.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Things might have been bad a couple of years
              ago, but they have got worse. In 1999, 14,020 people were waiting
              for orthopaedic outpatient appointments; today that figure has
              almost doubled. That should illustrate the situation for those who
              are in any doubt that we are in crisis.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Health Service is not doing enough for
              victims of sexual abuse. I met the chief executive of the Ulster
              Hospital Community Trust, and I asked him to make extra provision.
              The money is not there. The Nexus Institute does tremendous work
              in providing counselling. However, when I asked for extra
              provision for counselling in my constituency, I was told that the
              institute would love to do that, because people needed assistance,
              but that there was no money. There is extra demand on the Health
              Service, and the service is needed, but it is not being delivered.
              People need help, but the Department has failed to deliver.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Administration must be revamped. There are 27
              trusts and four boards, yet there is talk of introducing another
              level of administration into the Health Service. We must make
              changes, and there must be streamlining at that level to make the
              service more efficient.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to funding for the Health Service,
              it is time that we took the matter to the highest level, to
              Westminster. It is time for funding to be made available through
              the Department and through the Office of the First Minister and
              the Deputy First Minister. The time is right for a radical
              approach, with no holds barred. If that does not happen, I am
              afraid that we shall return to discuss the future of the Health
              Service while our constituents wait and suffer. I wonder how many
              of those on the waiting list for urgent operations will be here in
              a few months or less if they do not get the urgent and positive
              action that is needed. I support the motion.</p>

              brú suntasach a bheith ar ár n-otharlanna agus go háirithe ar

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ón uair a ceapadh i m’Aire mé, tharraing
              mé aird ar na brúnna troma atá ar ár n-otharlanna agus ar ár

              fheabhsú, go háirithe san uair is treise brú.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many Members have expressed concern about the
              situation in our hospital services today. I share their anxiety,
              and I am equally determined to ensure that the underlying issues
              are effectively addressed. I note the widespread recognition by
              Members of the significant pressures on our hospitals, and
              particularly on the staff who work in them. I have the highest
              admiration for the work of our staff, whose skill, expertise and
              commitment have played a vital part in minimising the effects of
              recent pressures on hospital patients.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ever since my appointment, I have drawn
              attention to the heavy pressures on our hospitals and community
              care services and argued strongly that these services have not
              been resourced in the past to meet the demands made on them. I
              welcome the fact that that has been reiterated today by virtually
              every Member who spoke in the debate. Our community and hospital
              services simply do not have the capacity or the staffing to handle
              the continually growing demands that are being made of them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Despite the removal from the baseline of £190
              million in today’s terms since the 1980s and 1990s, the service
              has treated 10% more patients, and there has been a 27% increase
              in community care packages. The service has also seen an increase
              in emergency admissions of almost 10% in the last year. I have
              maintained that without significant recurring investment over
              several years, our services will not be able to deal with the
              pressures that Members have drawn attention to so graphically
              today.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over recent weeks and months I have also
              highlighted the fact that, despite all the problems relating to
              resourcing, there is still much that is positive happening across
              our services. We continue to make real progress in improving the
              quality and effectiveness of services, and our planning to
              streamline our systems and improve collaboration continues to pay
              dividends, particularly at times of intense pressure. Colleagues
              elsewhere have commented favourably on the degree of integration
              in our services.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the work and the immediate
              action that has been taken to address the situation that I faced
              when taking office, since that day our hospitals have 33 more
              intensive-care and high-dependency beds, 100 more nurses are
              entering training every year and more people are receiving
              community care than ever before. There will be a further 1,000
              extra community care packages in the coming year alone, on top of
              the additional 230 extra this year, and 100 new ambulances are on
              our roads.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have also directed additional resources into
              important areas of hospital services, such as cancer treatment and
              cardiac surgery. That is only an initial step in the right
              direction. Local cancer units are now up and running in all our
              major hospitals, with over 50% of all day-patient chemotherapy now
              provided outside the main centre in Belfast. We are also making
              significant progress on the construction of the new cancer centre.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On foot of the recent review of cardiac
              surgery, I am putting in place measures to get more operations
              carried out and to deal with unacceptably long waits for
              treatment. We have carried out convincing work to improve all of
              those services. I am determined to press for further improvements
              in the quality of both those vital service areas.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are also addressing capacity issues through
              staffing, recruitment, training and the professional development
              of staff by means of comprehensive health and social services
              workforce planning. That will have a direct and positive impact on
              the staffing of hospitals. Those are just some of the building
              blocks being used to put meat on the bones of our clear vision for
              high-quality services as resources become available to put the
              vision into practice. There has also been detailed planning over
              the short, medium and longer terms. We have the investing for
              health strategy, the review of acute hospital services, ‘Building
              the Way Forward in Primary Care’, the review of community care
              and the implementation of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service
              review. Those measures will enable us to take the necessary steps
              to meet the needs of the service user, while reflecting the
              potential impact of longer-term drivers for change, such as the
              age profile of the population and new or emerging medical
              technologies.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have already reported to the Assembly on how
              I am developing that work. I assure Members that my Department and
              I are committed to working closely and effectively with the
              Committee. I value and welcome the Committee’s input and support
              and I will do so in respect of the work that lies ahead. We must
              work together to make this vision for the future a reality.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other immediate actions have taken place. I
              have already mentioned extra nurses, extra ambulances, extra care
              in the community and extra intensive care and high-dependency
              beds. On top of that, the Northern Ireland Social Care Council has
              been established, to develop the work that social workers want
              done and to improve standards for social workers. There are extra
              residential childcare places, there is closer integration of the
              service, and I have put in place financial management
              arrangements. There have been several forms of immediate action,
              and yet the self-same Members still stand up during debates and
              say that a decision must be made. When I make a decision, I am
              described as &quot;imposing change&quot;.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am working very closely to set up local
              health and social care groups. Much work has already been
              undertaken, guidance has been issued, and further guidance will be
              provided shortly. The Department has been discussing the matter
              with the British Medical Association and other colleagues. We are
              setting up these groups to ensure that local people and local
              health professionals can work together in a multidisciplinary
              fashion to make local decisions about local services. In addition,
              this year there has been significant investment in primary care,
              with an additional £2 million of investment to support the
              infrastructure of general practice and £2·3 million secured from
              Executive programme funds to modernise the use of information and
              communication technology (ICT), as one Member mentioned. The aim
              of our work is to modernise the use of ICT in general practice
              over the next three years.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A further £1·5 million for primary care
              development was devolved to boards, and additional money has been
              made available to boards this year to meet the cost of setting up
              the new groups from 1 April 2002. The money currently used to run
              the GP fundholding scheme, which is tied up in that, and to run
              the commissioning pilots will be redeployed to finance the new
              arrangements. That will also allow up to £2·5 million to be
              diverted from management costs to front- line primary care
              services. We cannot do that until GP fundholding ends next year.
              It was unfortunate that we were not able to end that last year.
              That is on top of the additional resources that I already
              mentioned.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I join Members in expressing my absolute
              disgust at the attacks on health and social services staff. The
              recent attacks in Altnagelvin Hospital have already been
              mentioned. The Western Health and Social Services Board and
              Altnagelvin Hospital are discussing specific measures to enhance
              security at the hospital. I share Members’ concerns about this
              outrageous attack on vital services, and I know that the trust and
              the board will give priority to looking at improvements. I will
              give immediate attention to any proposals that come to me and,
              while I am attending this debate, my permanent secretary is
              visiting Altnagelvin Hospital.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to primary care patients, a great
              deal of action has been taken to provide new GP out-of-hours
              arrangements to keep people out of hospitals. We also ran a recent
              advertising campaign to encourage people to get the right
              treatment, particularly during winter. The Member who raised the
              point will know of the pilot schemes in Ards Community Hospital
              and Bangor Community Hospital, which treat many people who would
              otherwise have gone to the accident and emergency department at
              the Ulster Hospital. Primary care is central to the way in which
              our social and health services will work together in the years
              ahead.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.30 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recognise that the development of the cancer
              centre is a priority. Work is ongoing at the day-patients’ and
              outpatients’ wing of the planned cancer facility. That will be
              completed at the end of 2002 and will be open early next year. The
              Department of Finance and Personnel has approved a detailed
              business case for the construction of the new centre, which has
              been revised to take account of best practice and the latest
              technology. With the support of the Committee for Health, Social
              Services and Public Safety, I shall raise that crucial development
              with Executive Colleagues, with a view to having it included in
              the next tranche of Executive programme funds. The Committee has
              discussed the matter with me in the past.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I take the opportunity to outline some of the
              immediate actions and benefits that have resulted from the
              framework for action on waiting lists, on which many people have
              worked so assiduously. The MRI waiting list initiatives that are
              taking place across all boards, which include the use of mobile
              scanners, have successfully reduced waiting numbers. In cardiac
              surgery initiatives, the Northern Health and Social Services Board
              has secured capacity with Health Care International (HCI) Private
              Hospital and Ross Hall Hospital in Glasgow for 51 patients. If all
              those patients undergo surgery before the end of this financial
              year, the board’s excess waiting list for cardiac operations
              will be cleared.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Southern Health and Social Services Board
              is using a mobile cath lab at Craigavon Area Hospital to treat 20
              patients per month. The Western Health and Social Services Board
              is using the North West Independent Hospital at Ballykelly for
              orthopaedic and plastic surgery, and the Northern Board has plans
              to do that also. Some 210 orthopaedic outpatients have been seen
              in the Southern Board as a result of a waiting list initiative.
              The Western Board has held additional ophthalmology clinics at Roe
              Valley Hospital, which had reduced inpatient waiting numbers from
              360 to 30 at 19 December 2001, and the average waiting time from
              two years to six months.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In general surgery, the Mater Hospital and the
              Downe Hospital will take 50 and 200 patients respectively from
              other providers by March 2002. We are working continually on the
              validation of waiting lists and on specific pilot projects on
              restructuring theatre use and on rheumatology. Down Lisburn Health
              and Social Services Trust has an acute and community nurse pilot
              scheme for rheumatology, and it is also making use of an acute and
              community nurse for chronic pain. Those are just some of the
              initiatives that are being introduced to address current problems.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have been monitoring the situation at
              Craigavon Area Hospital and other hospitals for some time, and I
              am very aware that staff in Craigavon are working under extreme
              pressure. I spoke to staff when I visited that hospital, and I
              have spoken frequently to the chairperson and the chief executive.
              Departmental officials are also in continual contact with the
              hospital. The Southern Health and Social Services Board and
              Craigavon Area Hospital have been working closely together to deal
              with the increasing pressures on the hospital.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I assure Ian Paisley Jnr that I look doctors,
              nurses and ancillary workers in the eye daily. I am delighted to
              hear that he recognises the effects of underfunding on our
              services, and I hope that he will work with me to fight for better
              resources to support those hard-pressed staff.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although much can be done to make effective use
              of the facilities at the South Tyrone Hospital, it is not
              currently possible to provide the type of overnight care
              described. As Members will know, the Royal College of Physicians
              withdrew training recognition from the hospital in July 2000. That
              decision, on top of several measures that had been taken in
              previous years, led to the temporary removal of some services from
              that site.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The long-term decisions on the future of the
              hospital will be taken in the context of the acute hospitals
              review. There are, however, many outpatient clinics and day
              surgeries, including new clinics for cardiac outpatients, and
              brain trauma, at South Tyrone Hospital. There is also a doctor-led
              minor injuries unit, a comprehensive radiology service, inpatient
              medical geriatric wards, a day hospital for the elderly and a
              significant professions- allied-to-medicine service. As South
              Tyrone Hospital cannot provide overnight care of the type
              described, it could not have been used to help those recovering
              from major trauma surgery when pressure was being placed on
              Craigavon Area Hospital. However, the Southern Board and Craigavon
              Area Hospital Group Trust are working together to determine how
              more effective use can be made of South Tyrone Hospital. The
              question that was raised on extending the doctor-led minor
              injuries provision is currently under investigation as part of
              those discussions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members often talk of the need to approach the
              Chancellor of the Exchequer to get a fair share of public money. I
              do not wish — and it would not be right — to stray into the
              remit of the Finance and Personnel Minister, Dr Seán Farren.
              However, I fully agree that the Barnett formula is inadequate and
              defective, and I note that it will be a matter for the Executive
              to decide how to approach the matter in the future. If five sixths
              of additional money is spent on the rising costs of existing
              services, and the rising costs are being driven by developments in
              England on pay review body recommendations, drug costs, clinical
              and other professional standards, and we are not receiving the
              same uplifts as England, the inevitable effect will be an impact
              on our standards and levels of service here. In spite of getting
              additional money this year on top of Barnett, the Department of
              Health, Social Services and Public Safety is faring less well than
              the provision in England, where all the significant drivers of pay
              costs originate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This year our budget is 5·6% higher than the
              amount spent last year, including one-off non-recurrent moneys
              that I secured from monitoring rounds. In England the equivalent
              increase is 9·4%. Those involved there receive a greater amount
              of recurrent funding which aids them in their longer-term
              planning. As has been said, there is a distinct difficulty in
              having to rely on additional in-year moneys, which are welcome,
              but they are non-recurrent. Therefore they are not suitable for
              use in addressing recurring difficulties. They are also not useful
              in employing additional staff or in addressing long-term planning.
              We need not only significant extra resources, but much more
              certainty about the level of funding in the future. Therefore,
              with regard to the December monitoring addition, it is one-off
              money, and it would not be prudent to use it for recurrent
              expenditure. The best and only effective way to put back the
              capacity that we need is to ensure that we have a properly
              resourced service. I will try my hardest to secure that in the
              spending review.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Similarly, I have put in place financial
              management arrangements that ensure that I can track the money. I
              published my priorities for action in the Programme for
              Government, which sets out the key priorities for the service.
              Boards now have to set out their service investment plans and how
              they intend to deploy their additional resources. Similarly,
              trusts, in their service delivery plans, have to set out how they
              will deliver the agenda. The resources that were needed to deliver
              the priorities listed in the priorities for action have all been
              ring-fenced this year, and no discretion is allowed for their
              deployment elsewhere.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regular progress meetings with boards enable us
              to keep track of where the money is going and, should boards wish
              to redeploy some of the ring-fenced funds, they must first get our
              approval.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have put in place a complete system to ensure
              that health and personal social services remain financially
              stable, including a requirement to pursue robust recovery plans
              where expenditure exceeds income by more than 0·5% and the
              requirement to produce contingency plans when in-year deficits are
              forecast.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, one of the most significant points has
              been the moves to remove the internal market, which contributed to
              the financial problems by imposing significant income risks on the
              system and having competitive, rather than collaborative, working
              arrangements. We have now introduced much more collaborative
              working arrangements between boards and trusts.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, ensuring that care services are
              adequately funded before new developments are considered is
              another important point. However, the overall point is that if we
              can ensure adequate funding for services to begin with, then we
              can make best use of those services, and of the dynamism,
              dedication and commitment of our staff.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reference was made to the additional funds that
              I have received this year, and questions were asked about what had
              happened in relation to that. People will know that of that money
              — allowing for pay and price inflation, as one Member said —
              there was £41 million available to improve services. That is less
              than 2% of a £2·25 billion budget. However, within that I have
              used those resources to achieve, among other things, an increase
              in the number of high-dependency beds; investment in improving
              cancer services; the extension of the Sure Start programme for
              disadvantaged children; an increase in the number of residential
              childcare places; an increase in the number of community care
              packages; and the beginning of modernisation of the Ambulance
              Service’s accident and emergency fleet. Those are vital issues
              that had to be addressed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like many Members, I have talked about the
              problem of resources, and much of the pressure that pervades our
              hospital services has its roots in a lack of investment over many
              years. As I have said, no less than £190 million — in today’s
              terms — was taken out of health and social services in the 1980s
              and 1990s. The legacy of that approach has left a massive lack of
              capacity in staff, in beds, in equipment and in the community. The
              outcome is that too many people are in hospital who do not need or
              want to be there. The immediate action and the long-term planning
              that we are engaged in are intended to provide a service in which
              that will not be the outcome for our people. There is no way
              around the present lack of capacity other than by returning
              capacity to the service. To do that, we need a stable funding
              platform to support the development and maintenance of all our
              services.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A properly resourced service is an absolute
              priority. I welcome the extra funding that has been made available
              for this year and next. It will help to sustain existing services
              and facilitate some modest improvements. However, it will be a
              long haul to remedy the funding failures of the past. In the
              meantime, the service is working hard with what it has.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In preparing for winter, for example, a great
              deal of detailed planning went into making sure that services were
              boosted for the inevitable winter peaks in demand. There are extra
              hospital beds and nursing home beds available in this winter
              period, as well as extra community care services. GP and community
              pharmacist services have been augmented, and there was another
              successful flu vaccination programme this year. That is evidence
              of the commitment and dedication of the staff and also of a year’s
              detailed planning to see what was needed to ensure that winter
              pressures would be met by a service that had planned for it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the recent virus outbreak that resulted
              in the temporary closure of some beds on top of the winter
              pressures, staff worked tirelessly to minimise the disruption to
              patients. Different trusts worked together collaboratively, as we
              saw with Musgrave Park Hospital and others when the flu virus
              affected the fracture service in the Royal Victoria Hospital.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.45 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Staff deserve our thanks and credit for their
              efforts over these weeks in containing and controlling the
              outbreak and in ensuring that no one who needed emergency care was
              denied it. It is crucial that we give them the support and the
              resources they need and that we look to the longer-term future of
              our hospitals. The acute hospitals review will prepare the ground
              for major and long-overdue modernisation of our hospital services.
              The resulting discussion at Executive level, the consultation, the
              equality impact assessment and the final decisions — all to be
              taken in the course of this year — will set the hospitals’
              agenda for some years to come.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to build hospital services as part of an
              overall, fully integrated service that will meet need not only
              today, but into the future also. That work will require
              commitment, determination and resourcing. The work that I have
              begun will bear fruit, and I am determined to see it through. I
              look forward to Members’ support in building the services that
              people have every right to expect.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Berry:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been a delight to sit through the debate
              and listen to many Members’ concerns in relation to Northern
              Ireland’s Health Service.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I rubbish the claim that the DUP is being
              political by tabling such a motion. I stress that we have
              constituents coming to us from both sides of the community who are
              raising deep concerns about the healthcare treatment that they or
              their relatives have been receiving in hospitals across Northern
              Ireland. It is important for public representatives such as us to
              highlight those concerns in the Assembly. Health is an important
              issue, and no matter what colour, creed or religion a person is,
              if he fears his health is affected or that he has recurring cancer
              and he is told that he must wait for seven months before seeing a
              consultant, such as was the case with Dr Paisley’s constituent,
              such issues should be brought to the Floor of the House. We cannot
              say &quot;Oh sorry, we cannot raise that because we might be
              accused of being political.&quot; We need to steer away from that
              and focus on our constituents’ concerns.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members of the Committee for Health, Social
              Services and Public Safety tell me that health is one of their
              constituents’ biggest concerns. Why is that the case? It is
              because of the state of our Health Service, and it is up to us to
              highlight that situation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The majority of Members’ speeches today have
              been helpful and productive. Dr Hendron mentioned GP fundholding.
              That issue was raised by GPs last year at the Committee for
              Health, Social Services and Public Safety. We have lost a golden
              opportunity to provide a first-class measure in primary care, and
              we must seize the opportunity we now have to put that right. I
              trust that the Department will take Dr Hendron’s and other
              Members’ views and concerns about primary care and the ending of
              GP fundholding on board.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Robert Coulter stated that Members must not
              attempt to score points. I agree with that. We have to work for
              the constituents of Northern Ireland, no matter where they are
              from. Many people have deep concerns about their health. Rev
              Robert Coulter discussed the problem of waiting for operations as
              did my Colleague Mr Shannon, who stated that a patient must first
              go onto a consultant’s waiting list and then wait for the
              operation to be scheduled. That waiting time can average out at
              over a year. That is totally unacceptable. Rev Robert Coulter
              stated that we must examine the entire Health Service system in
              Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is clear from the debate that although money
              is important, we must take a close look at the management of the
              Health Service. I want the Department to tell the Assembly,
              through the Health Committee, what it intends to do about its
              management structure and the boards and trusts. I have not yet
              heard the Department make any proactive suggestions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Courtney said that proper management from
              top to bottom of the structure and on the hospital wards would
              improve the Health Service. The perception is that there is too
              much bureaucracy. However, it is up to us to keep highlighting
              that until the perception is no longer true. Although we need
              professional management, it must be properly structured.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Robert Coulter said that we must examine
              doctors’ and consultants’ contracts. He raised concerns about
              nurses’ training, the morale of medical staff and the stress
              that they are under. The Health Committee has visited many
              hospitals and talked to nurses on the wards. They told us of
              patients waiting on trolleys for beds, but they also told us about
              the pressure that they are under. Nurses and health professionals
              must deal with complaints and the anxiety of patients’ relatives
              all the time, which causes them stress and anxiety. The Department
              must consider that and deal with it in order to help the nurses’
              situation. It requires immediate decisions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Colleague Mr Watson commended the hospital
              staff across Northern Ireland, as Members have often done. In the
              last debate on the Health Service in Northern Ireland, I said that
              the service was running on the goodwill of the nurses, doctors and
              hospital staff. These problems must not be put on the back-burner.
              As a Member of the Assembly and of the Health Committee, I say
              that if we must continue to raise the issue of the Health Service,
              we shall do so. We should raise it at every opportunity, because
              it is our duty to the people whom we represent and to the nurses
              and hospital staff.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problems of Craigavon Area Hospital have
              made headlines for several weeks. The problems are still there,
              and we must examine them. Mr Morrow gave us his views on the
              problems in his constituency, as well as those of Upper Bann and
              Newry and Armagh. Craigavon Area Hospital and the hospitals in
              those areas are under pressure because of the closure of the South
              Tyrone and Banbridge Hospitals. Those closures were bound to have
              a detrimental effect on the Health Service and on Craigavon Area
              Hospital. Craigavon was put under pressure by having to cover the
              services of other constituencies. Mr Morrow called for the
              reopening of South Tyrone Hospital to provide more services. We
              must relieve the pressure on Craigavon Area Hospital before it
              reaches meltdown.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We go from one crisis to another. All our
              people have the fundamental right to good healthcare. He said that
              there is a perception in the community that no one cares. Surely
              this debate shows that someone cares. The debates initiated by Ms
              Hanna and Mr Gallagher showed that someone cares. It is important
              that those issues are taken on board. The Assembly has to show the
              community that it cares.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Time and time again we hear that the Tories
              created the current problems in the Health Service, yet in today’s
              headlines we find a problem that was not created by the Tories.
              During the last three years £27 million has been paid out in
              medical negligence cases. That is a matter of deep concern. How
              can the Assembly tell the people of Northern Ireland that it is
              doing everything it can for the Health Service, when they only
              have to look at the headline in today’s ‘Belfast Telegraph’
              to find that £27 million, which could have been spent on many of
              the issues that were discussed in the debate today, has been going
              down the gully? The Health Committee needs to know — at its
              meeting tomorrow — how that £27 million was wasted and what
              plans are being put in place to ensure that that never happens
              again. Whether the sum is £27 million or £100 that should not
              happen. Something needs to be done about it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gallagher went on to say that funding and
              management are big issues. The high salaries paid to executives
              also give cause for great concern. He felt that general planning
              is needed. He referred to the South Tyrone Hospital. Management
              and funding were the two big issues raised today.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McFarland raised a point that I thought was
              important. He asked where the £2·5 billion was being spent. He
              stated rightly that the Committee had tried to examine the health
              accounts and that it had not been possible at that time. How is
              that money spent through the system? The Committee needs further
              briefing on that situation. He also stated that there is a problem
              with poor relations between the Department and the Committee.
              Committee members trust that those relations will be mended in the
              weeks ahead. He also said that there was an arrogant attitude
              towards the Committee. That must be rectified.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr talked about the problems that
              are renewed daily. He mentioned his visit to Craigavon Area
              Hospital. He said that everyone there is under severe pressure —
              patients, relatives, nurses and doctors — and that something
              needs to be done. He said that he thought the Health Service was
              in meltdown. There is a lack of beds and a lack of resources, and
              management at the top has failed. That is the perception in the
              community. It is up to the Department to take all those matters on
              board and to deal with them effectively now. In future when
              officials from the Department are being cross- examined and
              questioned they must have proper answers.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams made some important points. She
              wanted to know what proposals were being brought forward. She said
              that time and time again this subject has been debated in the
              Chamber and asked what was being done about it. Debates such as
              this are important. There are Department of Health officials here
              taking notes of Members’ proposals. It is a way of doing
              something about the Health Service.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams also condemned the attacks on
              health staff across Northern Ireland. The House condemns the
              attacks on the staff at Altnagelvin Hospital. Those are matters of
              grave concern. Further attacks on medical staff in hospitals will
              have an impact on resources. Staff are, quite rightly, calling for
              measures to deal with the problem. However, the provision of
              security to allay the anxieties of staff and relatives visiting
              the hospitals will require more money.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There have been many matters raised in the
              debate today. In conclusion, more needs to be done regarding the
              perception of management and about how funding is spent. Also, the
              Assembly needs to know more about the waste of £27 million
              through medical negligence. We need answers and action — not
              reviews, consultation and discussion —to address this crisis.</p>
