                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Prior to the debates yesterday on the motion
                to amend Standing Orders and on the election of the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister, I received two valid
                petitions of concern signed by 30 Members in respect of the
                motion and the vote. Therefore in accordance with Standing Order
                27 no vote could be held until at least one day had passed. The
                Business Committee considered the matter yesterday during the
                suspension for lunch and unanimously agreed that the vote be
                placed on the Order Paper for today, and that was distributed. I
                remind Members that today’s business is purely the conduct of
                the votes; it is not to provide further opportunity for debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A simple majority will decide the vote on the
                amendment, which is on the Marshalled List. The vote on the
                motion and the vote on the election of the First Minister and
                the Deputy First Minister will be decided on a cross- community
                basis. The second of those votes requires parallel consent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have received a further petition of concern
                in respect of the election of the First Minister and the Deputy
                First Minister. The petition of concern was received within the
                required time, which is at least one hour before the vote. I
                have had to decide whether I should accept the petition of
                concern, insofar as it will delay the vote for a further day.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">According to the Northern Ireland Act 1998,
                under section 42(1) and (2), petitions of concern do not require
                a particular delay. The Act requires that a cross- community
                vote be taken. That is already the case in respect of the
                election of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister.
                Standing Order 27(1) requires that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;No vote may be held on a matter which
                is the subject of a petition of concern until at least one day
                after the Petition of Concern has been presented.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must judge whether it is reasonable to
                accept repeated petitions of concern on the same issue, meaning
                that a delay of one day could occur potentially on a repeated
                basis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The purpose of a petition of concern is
                twofold. First, in accordance with the Act, its purpose is to
                ensure that the vote is decided on a cross-community basis. This
                vote will be on a cross-community, parallel consent basis.
                Secondly, the purpose of a one-day delay, provided for by
                Standing Order 27(1), is to permit the Assembly to consider the
                matter further. Therefore, the petition of concern ensures that
                both cross-community support and full consideration have been
                given.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is it reasonable to accept repeated petitions
                of concern in respect of a specific question? The Speaker has a
                responsibility and a duty to give rulings on matters of
                procedure and to ensure that the business of the House is
                conducted properly. Having considered the question, I rule that
                more than one petition of concern on any matter, in order to
                delay matters for more than one day, is not permissible. I will
                not accept that.</p>

                considering, perhaps you can draw our attention to the Standing

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have not suggested that there is a Standing
                Order that forbids it but that it is for the Speaker to rule on
                the question. There can be little reasonable denial of that. I
                have made my ruling.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. It seems to
                me that you are resting your decision on the desires of certain
                people. We are held up today because of a petition of concern.
                That petition of concern was submitted not for the purpose of
                concern, but to get the amendment dealt with so that there could
                be a change of designation. Then there would be no concern. I do
                not think, therefore, that you can judge the morality or the
                objective of the petition of concern.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You are entitled to deal with a petition of
                concern — I do not deny that — but the reason for tabling
                the petition of concern should not sway your decision. The
                reference in Standing Orders to petitions of concern is clear;
                it does not analyse it; it does not parse it; it does not
                include any other consideration but stands naked on the Order
                Paper.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I trust that I have not expressed a view on
                the morality of the issue. I must address the question because
                this is the first time that petitions of concern about the same
                matter have been tabled seriatim. If I were to accept one
                further petition of concern, that would suggest that there was
                no reason why I might not accept it day after day. That would
                not be a proper way of proceeding. My ruling is not a judgement
                on the motivation behind either the first petition of concern or
                the second; it is on the question of whether repeated petitions
                of concern, submitted under the Standing Orders — not the
                Northern Ireland Act 1998 — should create a repeated delay of
                a day. That is not proper in this or any other circumstance.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Quite
                properly, you said that, in the absence of an Upper House, a
                petition of concern allowed Members to consider fully the
                implications of a motion. The implications of this motion are
                fundamentally important. Yesterday, a decision was taken about
                redesignation that may have altered the views of some Members,
                particularly those from the UUP. The motion can be passed only
                if UUP Members are determined to accept as Unionists, for the
                purposes of a vote, the redesignated Alliance Party Members.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am well aware of the situation. There may
                be some UUP Members with a scintilla of conscience who may wish
                to consider at length the implications of their actions. It

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will deal with the points of order as they
                arise.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney has raised what is, in a sense,
                a political question. I have answered the simple question
                whether repeated petitions of concern relating to a particular
                issue — it can be any issue, but it must be the same one for
                all the petitions — should be accepted. The Member also asked
                whether the fundamental political nature of the matter meant
                that repeated questions should be put. I referred to the
                situation in a Parliament with two Chambers, and, of course,
                there have been occasions when there has been a game of
                ping-pong between the two Chambers in another place. However,
                that has not happened simply because of the fundamental nature
                of the legislation at hand.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member has asked me to judge whether
                Members from a particular political party have had this matter
                sprung on them in such a way that they have been unable to give
                it due consideration.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be improper for me to make a
                judgement on that issue. However, on the procedural question of
                whether or not it should be permissible to have repeated
                petitions of concern on any specific issue, the judgement that I
                make is that it is not a proper use of Standing Order 27(1).</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. In the light
                of your ruling, we appear to be approaching the point where it
                will be impossible to use the procedures of the House, or even
                the courts, to demonstrate what is quite clear. Mr Trimble has
                said that if he is elected under this process, it will lack
                credibility. Therefore, even if the House appoints Mr Trimble,
                it will lack credibility.</p>

                reason why he should not consult with legal advisers about the
                question of the courts if he wishes. I made it clear yesterday
                that the Assembly is set up under statute; it is subject to the
                law, and I would not dream of advising the Assembly to act ultra
                vires. However, that is a matter outside of the Chamber.</p>

                force of your argument that it would be wrong to use the process
                of a petition of concern to allow the same people to delay a
                matter by repeatedly putting in petitions of concern. However,
                the people who have signed this petition of concern have not
                submitted any previous petition of concern on the matter.
                Several issues have arisen in the last 24 hours, which have
                given rise to concern among my Colleagues who signed the
                petition of concern. They want a further 24 hours in which to

                irrational. However, I must judge what is proper procedure. Let
                us be clear; Members must still decide how they will vote. As
                for the suggestion that they may require more time, there was no

                consideration over two days, three days, or a week, it would
                have been at liberty to make such a decision yesterday. To my
                knowledge, that suggestion was never raised, and the Business
                Committee agreed to hold the sitting today. That is not the
                question. The question is one of procedure, which has not arisen
                before, and on which I believe I must rule. Is a petition of
                concern on the same issue, which is brought forward
                subsequently, a facility for delaying proceedings under Standing
                Order 27(1)? I accept that the Member has made a particular
                argument, but I have had to make a ruling, and I am persuaded
                that it is correct. I make it clear that the ruling does not
                apply solely in these circumstances; it sets a precedent.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. It is a most
                serious matter that a Member, who was coming to the House, has
                been attacked. Her property was attacked in such a way that she
                cannot come here in time for the sitting and a wreath was sent
                to her home.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is a very serious thing. I would say, Mr

                matter is not serious. I am very much aware that such questions
                have been around, and I have been conscious of them over the
                last day. However, my point is that if the House were to allow
                itself to have its procedures interfered with in that way, it
                would be a very serious precedent indeed. It would be quite
                inappropriate — <i>[Interruption]</i>.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. We must be duly and gravely concerned
                as we deal with such questions, but we should not abuse them. I
                do not suggest that the Members who have stood are doing so, but

                procedure for a personal statement is that he gives me in

                the next matter.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. In the light
                of section 16(8) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, are you
                satisfied on the basis of the advice given to you that the
                election of a First Minister and a Deputy First Minister beyond
                the stipulated period will certainly be valid, or is it your
                view that it may be valid? It is important to put on record that
                the consequences for the entire Government of Northern Ireland,
                and individual Departments and Ministers, if there is an
                election of a First Minister and a Deputy First Minister that
                turns out to be void, are serious. Potentially every decision
                would be unlawful and void. Have you therefore, Mr Speaker, come
                to the conclusion that it is valid to elect a First Minister and
                a Deputy First Minister despite the provisions of section 16(8)
                of the said Act?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to respond to that point of order
                before doing anything else. I then wish to make remarks in
                respect of the letters that I was in the process of opening when
                other points of order were raised. I will then take up
                subsequent points of order.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member has raised a serious question. I
                have given consideration to it on the two counts that he gave.
                First, I have considered the question of the balance of
                probabilities as to whether any election would be regarded by
                the courts in the present circumstances as being a wholly proper
                and acceptable one or whether there would be substantial doubt
                about the question. That is the burden of the point of order
                from the Member because, as he points out, if it were to be the
                case that a court subsequently struck down the election, the
                question would be whether any decisions taken during that
                interim period would be valid decisions or whether they would
                then be a problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is another aspect that the Member needs
                to keep in mind. If a First Minister and a Deputy First Minister
                were not elected, what would be the adverse consequences of that
                in terms of the Administration?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Elections are not an adverse consequence.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. I am simply drawing attention, quite
                properly, to the issues that have to be considered. I have taken
                the most senior advice that I possibly could from a legal point
                of view. It was clear from the advice that I was given, and from
                my consideration of the matter, that the balance of
                probabilities was overwhelmingly in favour of the argument that
                it would be not only acceptable but proper as far as a court was
                concerned that this Assembly had the right to so elect and that
                that would be a valid election.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That does not rule out the possibility, as
                the Member knows, of a challenge being mounted, which the court
                would consider. However, I am clear, and I hope this is of some
                reassurance to the Member and to the House, that I have given
                proper consideration to those questions.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further to my original point of order, Mr
                Speaker, you said that I could, in writing, ask to make a
                personal statement to the House. However, on what basis did you
                make the judgement yesterday that Lord Kilclooney could make a
                personal comment to the House without putting it in writing? <i>[Interruption]</i>.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. The Member may be in some confusion
                about what I said about personal statements. I did not say that
                he had to make an application in writing; I said the personal
                statement had to be submitted in writing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The context yesterday was different. During a
                debate the Member requested an opportunity to reply, in the
                context of the debate, to questions that had been raised about
                him. The only issue with regard to that was that it came
                immediately after the winding-up speech on the amendment, rather
                than immediately prior to it. That was a procedural issue and
                not a question of a personal statement. We are not now in a
                debate, so matters are different. The Member is at liberty to
                put all the issues in writing, and I will consider them for the
                next sitting.</p>

                the Library of the House the advice that was given to you as
                Speaker of the House? If you will not do that, is the Business
                Committee of the House entitled to know the basis on which you

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member is a highly experienced
                parliamentarian, and he is also wholly familiar with the
                procedures of lawyers and the courts. He will know that it is
                generally regarded as inappropriate for such advice to be
                published. The counsel that I seek is the Speaker’s counsel
                and not the counsel to the Business Committee. Again, I do not
                think that that would be appropriate. I have made the ruling
                that I should, but I am not able to accede to the Member’s
                request. However, if there is a wish to challenge it, the Member
                knows the road to the court rather well, and undoubtedly he will

                which can be claimed. However, it can be claimed only by the
                person who has received the advice. Do I understand that you are

                people of Northern Ireland.</p>

                formally again. This is not proper behaviour. Mr Trimble, please
