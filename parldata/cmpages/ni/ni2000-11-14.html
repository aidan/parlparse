                the Environment that he wishes to make a statement on the
                North/South Ministerial Council sectoral meeting held on 23
                October 2000.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of the Environment (Mr Foster): </b>With
                permission, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will make a statement about the
                second North/South Ministerial Council<b> 
                </b>
 sectoral meeting on
                the environment, which was held in Navan, County Meath, on
                Monday 23 October 2000.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following nomination by the First Minister
                and the Deputy First Minister, Ms Brid Rodgers and I attended
                the meeting. The Irish Government were represented by Mr Noel
                Dempsey TD, Minister of the Environment and Local Government,
                who chaired the meeting. This statement has been agreed by Ms
                Rodgers and is also made on her behalf.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council was given a progress report on
                the development of a joint register of current research
                projects. This included plans for the further development of the
                register as a website. The Council noted progress and agreed
                that the Environment Protection Agency and my Department’s
                Environment and Heritage Service should proceed to tender for a
                jointly funded contract to develop a website of current
                environmental research.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A summary report by officials on the scope
                for co-operation on new technologies for monitoring emissions to
                air and water, the aquatic environment, air quality and
                deposition was also presented to the Council. The full report
                will be presented to Ministers shortly and will be available on
                the websites of the Environment Protection Agency and the
                Environment and Heritage Service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council agreed that the greatest scope
                for successful co-operation on new technologies lies, for the
                present, in monitoring the aquatic environment. It was agreed,
                therefore, that the initial work in this area should focus on
                chemical and biological monitoring of surface waters and
                assessment of fish stocks.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council received a progress report on the
                work of the water quality management working group, which was
                established to consider strategies for the Erne and Foyle
                catchments and implementation of the EU water framework
                directive. The Council endorsed the work undertaken so far,
                particularly in developing appropriate arrangements for joint
                implementation of the Water Framework Directive in relation to
                shared waters, and the co-operation on associated technical
                issues. The group was asked to continue the effective
                development of the work and prepare progress reports for the
                Council.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council was also asked to consider
                proposals for the development of a database of environmental
                information, as a further area of co-operation. The Council
                noted progress to date, in both jurisdictions, on the
                development of environmental databases in a wide range of
                initiatives. It agreed that a database development and
                co-operation programme should be taken forward progressively by
                the Environment Protection Agency and the Environment and
                Heritage Service. It was agreed that this programme should place
                particular emphasis on the following: examining the options for
                completing the CORINE Land Cover Project 2000 in co-operation
                with the UK; developing and integrating key databases on issues
                such as river water quality, air quality and groundwater quality
                and a register of environmental data sources; and developing a
                joint Internet portal, providing access to information on
                environmental data.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council also considered a proposal for
                developing co-operation on the issue of the environmental impact
                of agriculture. It was agreed that a scoping study should be
                undertaken to develop co-operation on nutrient management
                planning in agriculture and controls on the cross-border
                movement and management of slurries, particularly in the context
                of the EU Directive on integrated pollution prevention and
                control.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council was asked to approve the release
                for public consultation of the draft equality scheme for the
                cross-border body on special EU programmes. That will assist the
                Special EU Programmes Body to finalise its equality scheme as
                soon as possible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I took the opportunity afforded by this
                meeting to raise with Minister Dempsey several issues about
                which Assembly Members had expressed concern, following the
                report that I made to the Assembly on 11 September about our
                first sectoral meeting. The matters that I raised were as
                follows: the problem of pollution in cross- border rivers, such
                as in the Erne system; the spread of zebra mussels; the mutual
                benefits that could arise from the management of waste in a
                cross-border context; the problems with disposing of spent
                mushroom compost, which affect the mushroom growers on both
                sides of the border; and our concerns that the major accident
                hazards Directive has not yet been implemented in the Republic
                of Ireland. The Council noted those matters and agreed that they
                would be addressed as the work programme of the environment
                sectoral group was taken forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council agreed that the next sectoral
                meeting on the environment would take place in February in
                Belfast and considered and agreed the text of the joint
                communiqué that was issued after the meeting. A copy of the
                communiqué has been placed in the Assembly Library.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for the
                Environment (Rev Dr William McCrea):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note the Minister’s statement. Last week
                my Committee wrote to the Minister about the Department’s
                budget for the coming year. Although we welcomed the increase in
                the overall budget, we were concerned that a number of bids had
                not been met. I am thinking in particular of the ongoing
                moratorium on the historic buildings grant and the £3·6
                million needed for vital landscape protection projects and major
                conservation.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The question should be about the Minister’s
                statement.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr William McCrea:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is directly related to the statement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot remember seeing any reference in the
                bids or allocations to the work mentioned in the Minister’s
                statement. Where will the funding for the projects that the
                Minister mentioned come from? If it is to come from his
                Department, can he specify how much will be set aside in the
                coming year for those projects? The Minister mentioned a
                contract to develop a website for environmental research. How
                much is that contract worth? What benefits will it deliver? How
                much will it cost Northern Ireland Departments?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister said that he expected that a
                full report on new technologies for monitoring would be issued
                shortly. How long will that &quot;shortly&quot; be? He also
                referred to the work undertaken to develop arrangements for the
                joint implementation of the water framework directive. How many
                of his officials are involved in that joint project, and what is
                the total cost to date — including salaries — to his
                Department? When will he advise the Environment Committee about
                that work?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Proposals relating to the environmental
                impact of agriculture were mentioned in the statement. Will the
                Department of Agriculture and Rural Development pay anything
                towards them?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister said that he had expressed
                concern on matters such as pollution in the system of Lough
                Erne, the spread of zebra mussels and the failure of the
                Republic of Ireland to implement the major accident hazard
                directive. He noted those serious issues, but when will
                something be done about them?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Foster:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That was a long series of questions. I am
                afraid that I will not be able answer them all in the pedantic
                fashion that Mr McCrea seeks.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The meetings of the North/South Ministerial
                Council are, overall, very beneficial. The costs of attending
                the meetings are largely confined to the travelling cost of
                Ministers and officials to venues in the Republic of Ireland or
                the cost of hosting the event when it is held in Northern
                Ireland. For example, the cost to my Department of the
                environment sectoral meeting in Navan was approximately £1,000.
                The web site will cost £60,000, of which £30,000 will come
                from the Northern Ireland budget.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The EU Water Framework Directive requires
                cross- border co-operation. The water quality group would be
                carrying out that work, in any case. The work involves five
                staff from the Environment and Heritage Service. We will work
                closely with the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development
                on all environmental issues. I spoke recently to both the
                president and vice-president of the Ulster Farmers’ Union. We
                are willing to work with them on any issue.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr J Wilson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following his statement to the House on 11
                September, I congratulated the Minister on his commitment to the
                improvement of water quality. I congratulate him again on the
                action that he is taking to fulfil that commitment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I noted in the statement that the Council
                received a report on the work of the water quality group. What
                progress has been made on arrangements for the implementation of
                the Water Framework Directive? Among the other matters that the
                Minister raised with his Southern counterpart was the spread of
                zebra mussels. Fermanagh is in his constituency, so he must be
                well aware of the infestation in Lough Erne. Will he focus on
                that issue as a matter of urgency?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Foster:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I spoke about zebra mussels to Minister
                Dempsey at the North/South meeting, and he took my comments on
                board. I am very concerned at how Lough Erne has been infested
                with zebra mussels, and I am also aware of the problem in Lough
                Melvin at Garrison. We will watch the situation closely.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Water Framework Directive requires that
                co-ordinated river basin management plans should be agreed
                between member states with transboundary waterways, such as
                those that we share with the Republic of Ireland. That is why
                implementation of the Directive was adopted as an early item of
                business for a water quality working group, consisting of
                officials from both jurisdictions. The EU Water Framework
                Directive has to be transposed into local legislation by member
                states within three years. It will establish catchment
                management plans and improvement programmes for the next two
                decades. We are making progress on that issue.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGrady:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate the Minister and his
                colleagues on the Council on the work that was set out in detail
                in his report to the House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What consideration has been given to the
                question of global warming? I am sure the Minister is aware that
                the Hague Conference meets this week as a follow-on from the
                Kyoto conference of 1997. Is he aware of the urgent report by 27
                European climatologists which warns of the drastic effect of
                global warming? Will his Council take this on board? In view of
                what seem to be irreversible climatic changes, will it look at
                the effects on the local environment, the landscape and farming
                and make provision for them?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We do not take those big issues lightly, and
                we are monitoring the global warming situation. We are
                progressing with a scoping study to identify the key areas in
                which climate changes is most likely to impact on Northern
                Ireland. I assure the Member that the matter will not go
                unnoticed; it is being watched very closely.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat. I am grateful for the
                opportunity to welcome the statement from a Minister on the
                North/South Ministerial Council meeting on the environment. In
                developing and establishing experimental issues across this
                island we shall all learn lessons which will enhance the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for his question. It was a
                bit difficult to understand what it really was, but I think he
                referred to waste management and waste strategy. There is a lot
                to be learnt from cross-border issues, and I have no hesitation
                in working from one jurisdiction to another. It is useful for
                both sides of the community, so it does not concern me at all.
                With regard to cross- border institutions, two different
                jurisdictions working and living together in a neighbourly
                fashion are bound to help each other, and I hope it will remain
                that way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased with the progress that has been
                made on implementing the waste strategy since its publication in
                March 2000. I am particularly pleased that the draft Budget
                proposals enable my Department to make available £3·5 million
                to help councils to implement the waste management strategy.
                That strategy requires district councils to submit individual or
                collective waste management plans to my Department by June 2001,
                and district councils have formed three waste management
                planning groups to meet this requirement. The north-west region
                cross-border group takes in Donegal County Council, and there is
                no problem whatsoever. We can learn from each other as two
                separate jurisdictions.</p>

                mentioned. When will we see it, please? When will we see the
                report on co-operation on new technologies for monitoring? What
                about the database development and co-operation programme
                referred to on page 3 — when will that be in place? What about
                the scoping study referred to at the bottom of page 3? There are
                probably too many questions to expect the Minister to answer
                now. My point is that, while this is a good report insofar as it
                goes — and I welcome its breadth — unless we can have a

                outcomes are expected over the next six months or so. The joint

                monitoring emissions to air and water, the aquatic environment
                and air quality and the deposit of airborne pollution. The
                report concluded that there are well-established methodologies
                in place for monitoring emissions and air quality. We are

                concerns with his counterpart in the Irish Republic. Does he
                agree that this demonstrates how North/South co-operation can

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I said earlier, there is no hesitation as
                far as I am concerned. It is useful to have cross-border
                co-operation because we are living as neighbours, although we
                are two different jurisdictions. As for issues which concern
                Members in Northern Ireland, it was an ideal opportunity to make
                points about those. I was pleased to put those issues to Mr Noel
                Dempsey at our last meeting, and he took them on board. It was a
                useful, worthwhile discussion. Despite the cross-community
                question mark, I was willing to act as a conduit. The whole
                issue is the benefit that we can gain for Northern Ireland. It
                is a matter of living neighbourly with our neighbours, so long

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a different issue, will the Minister
                inform us of the current situation with regard to EU regulations
                on the transport of various types of waste across frontiers?
                Will these regulations impact negatively on the important work
                being done through cross-border co-operation on the development
                of waste management strategies?</p>

                working together. There is no doubt that there are benefits to
                be gained from this sort of thing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member referred to the issue of
                Sellafield, which is raised quite often. The Sellafield plant is
                being watched closely. It is not our responsibility, but we do
                take water quality samples. Half of the radiation received by
                the average person in Northern Ireland is due to exposure to
                radon gas in the home, 12% comes from medical exposure, and
                nuclear discharges account for less than 0·1%. While there are
                concerns about Sellafield, it seems from my Department’s
                monitoring programme that there are no serious issues to be
                found in the water quality of the Irish Sea because of the
                Sellafield plant.</p>

                I am glad that I can put these questions to the Minister from

                certainly be examined, for that is an environmental health
                issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not aware of the existence of zebra
                mussels anywhere outside the Lough Erne catchment area or Lough

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The importation of BSE carcasses has been
                referred to, and rightly so because there is a concern about
                contamination. This is a very important matter which is the
                responsibility of the Department of Agriculture and Rural
                Development, and not just the Department of the Environment.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister continue to listen to the
                views of the agriculture community so that it may be fully
                involved in any environmental improvements? I am reassured that
                the Minister of Environment is alert to the needs of the
                agriculture sector and to the impact of the environment on
                agriculture and on those who depend on the environment for their
                living, not least our farmers.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Foster:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We take very seriously the impact of
                agriculture on the environment. Recently I spoke to the
                president of the Ulster Farmers’ Union, and on Saturday I met
                the union’s deputy president. Everyone acknowledges that
                agriculture is a major contributor to the economies of both
                Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Coming from a
                rural constituency, I fully appreciate the parlous circumstances
                in which Northern Ireland’s agriculture industry finds itself.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, we must also recognise the potential
                impact of agricultural activities on the environment. The
                greatest problem is the run-off of nutrients to lakes and
                rivers, leading to the excessive growth of algae and plants,
                which can cause oxygen levels to fall. This is the most serious
                water quality problem affecting waterways on both sides of the
                border. That is why at a recent meeting Ministers agreed to
                examine the scope for co-operation on the environmental impacts
                of agriculture. We agreed that the most mutually beneficial
                areas for co-operation might include planning for the controlled
                use of fertilisers and manures in agriculture and controls on
                the cross-border management and movement of slurries,
                particularly in the context of the European Directive on
                integrated pollution prevention and control.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Good intentions do not always make good
                legislation. I have concerns about this piece of legislation
                which I want to put on the record, and I hope, as we are still
                at Consideration Stage, that the Minister will be able to
                satisfy me that those concerns can be dealt with. I wish to
                raise matters in relation to clause 1 and clause 2.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Certain difficulties are becoming obvious for
                Members dealing with any legislation. First, I find that Members
                are beginning to think in sectors. For instance, if someone is
                on the Finance and Personnel Committee he tends to focus on
                business and finance. Because there is so much business in each
                of the Committees, Members are not looking at the legislation of
                Departments other than those whose affairs coincide with their
                Committee work. Indeed, this piece of legislation only came to
                my notice on Friday, and I only started asking questions about
                it yesterday as it was a matter which the Agriculture and Rural
                Development Committee was dealing with.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But it is a very important matter for local
                authorities. They have a key role because they will have to
                enforce the legislation. I therefore found it incomprehensible
                that the local authorities, which will be most affected by this
                legislation, were not asked by the Department for their views on
                it. On 7 November 2000 a dog control enforcement officers’
                seminar in Craigavon made that very clear to the Department’s
                representative. It was felt that to some extent the district
                councils had been snubbed. Indeed, the Department took advice
                from other bodies, such as the USPCA. The legislation is all the
                weaker for this failure, deliberate or otherwise, of the
                Department to consult with those who will have to implement and
                enforce the legislation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My second point is on the issue of
                discretion. There must be few, if any, Members who would deny
                that the Bill is useful to the extent that it will provide a
                court with new discretion when dealing with a destruction order
                for a dog. Under current legislation, no matter what the
                circumstances, councils are required to take the matter to court
                where, if it is found that the dog had attacked or worried, a
                destruction order must be made. That action is mandatory under
                the current law.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clearly that is an unsatisfactory set of
                circumstances, but I wonder to what extent it will be improved
                by this piece of legislation. Some discretion is to be given to
                the courts, but are they being given enough and should
                discretion be being given to someone other than the courts?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dealing with the latter issue first, should
                district councils have some discretion? Under this legislation,
                if a dog is involved in an attack, the matter will automatically
                be taken to court; there is no element of choice or freedom.
                Should that always be so? For example, say that your daughter is
                out walking Rover and is set upon by two or three louts, who
                perhaps intend to rape her or rob her. Rover attacks these
                people and, in fending them off, he bites or mauls them. Will a
                district council say &quot;Yes, this dog probably saved the girl’s
                life, but we are going to issue a destruction order against it
                — we are going to take the matter to court&quot;? Surely there
                are exceptional circumstances where a council should be able to
                say &quot;This is ridiculous, we are not prepared to do
                this&quot; and not proceed with a prosecution. The public will
                not view councils in a favourable light if they are seen to be
                taking a case like that to the courts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even if councils are not given that level of
                discretion, under the new legislation the courts will have very
                limited discretion. Either they will be able to have the dog
                destroyed or they will be able to impose measures on him. There
                is no such thing as exoneration for this dog, even though most
                people would say that he deserved a medal. The court has no
                alternative but to punish the dog. The legislation says</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Where it appears to a court that a dog
                has attacked any person or has worried livestock, the court
                shall&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a requirement on the court to do it.
                I am worried by any piece of legislation which, in the same
                context, contains both a &quot;shall&quot; and a
                &quot;may&quot;. Clause 1(2) uses the word &quot;shall&quot;,
                and then, when explaining the measures that might be specified,
                says</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;An order under paragraph (1)(b) may
                include provision requiring the dog to be&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can the Minister explain this?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Four provisions are specified. Is the
                Minister saying that these are the only four provisions that can
                be employed? Do the courts have the discretion to create their
                own measures? What are the implications for the general public
                and for the councils who have to carry out these additional
                measures? We are entitled to know if these are the only four
                provisions and if the court has to apply at least one of them.
                We need some clarity, but in the meantime I will assume that
                there are only four. These are the words of the first
                requirement:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;securely fitted with a muzzle
                sufficient to prevent the dog biting any person&quot;.</p>
                </font><i><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.15 am</p>
                </font></i><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I notice in the Committee’s minutes of
                evidence that an official from the Department of Agriculture and
                Rural Development had this issue put to him. He did not answer
                the question, and what he said caused me more concern. After
                where it says that the dog should be muzzled permanently, he
                suggested the insertion of the words &quot;when in a public
                place&quot;. That would be counterproductive because it could
                place legitimate visitors to the person’s premises in
                jeopardy. The milkman and postman would, in theory, be at risk
                if the dog were not, in law at least, muzzled in all places. In
                practice, I am sure, it would not be muzzled while on the owner’s
                premises. However, under the current wording, the owner would be
                responsible if somebody were bitten on his premises. I am pretty
                sure that if the courts were to apply the provision about
                securely fitting a muzzle to prevent a dog biting any person the
                intention would not be to exclude visitors to the owner’s
                home. The courts would not simply dismiss the incident with the
                words &quot;Well, it is his fault because he did not have a
                muzzle on the dog.&quot;</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The courts will want an assurance that
                fitting a muzzle will prevent anybody from being bitten.
                According to the evidence of the Department’s representative,
                there were caveats. I am curious about the phrase used. The
                milkman and postman would, in theory, be at risk if the dog were
                not, in law at least, muzzled in all places. That can only mean
                that it may be required by law, but common sense will prevail,
                because we cannot expect the dog to be muzzled in all places. My
                view is that it should be muzzled in all places if the
                circumstances require it.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Fee:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the beginning, the Member advocated that
                councils, or certain council officers, should exercise greater
                discretion. Now he is advocating that the owner of the dog
                should not be allowed to decide when it should be muzzled and
                when it should not. The only discretion that will be exercised
                in this matter will be by Rover. Can the Member clarify exactly
                where he is coming from on that point?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sorry that the Member is being obtuse
                — perhaps deliberately so. The discretion that I want is on
                whether measures are applied. Once that is done there should be
                no discretion, and those who ultimately have to enforce the
                measures will want to know exactly what they are enforcing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have to address the issue of enforcement
                because it is not clear. I am saying that the muzzle, in the
                circumstances I have referred to, should be on in all places,
                but I am not saying that it should be on at all times. The dog
                should be allowed to eat a meal or there will be feeding
                difficulties. However, it should be muzzled in all places, and
                that matter needs to be dealt with. The suggestion is that we
                turn a blind eye to various issues that the law should be
                concerned with.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue that follows on from that is while
                the dog may be muzzled, it is not required to be controlled on a
                lead, be in the charge of someone over 16 years of age, or be
                muzzled in a public place, as required by the Dangerous Dogs
                Compensation and Exemption Schemes Order (Northern Ireland)
                1991. We need to clarify how this requirement will be enforced,
                and by whom. Once the courts have applied it, will district
                councils be required to check periodically to ensure that it is
                being enforced? Is it for a period or for the life of the dog,
                and what is required if there is a change of ownership? These
                issues are unclear, but this is what the people who have to
                enforce this legislation need to know.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second requirement is that the dog be
                secured in a building, shed, yard or other enclosure. Will the
                courts be giving guidance as to the nature of the enclosure and
                the level of security, or is that going to be a matter for
                councils? If councils have that additional responsibility will
                additional funding be required? Also, is there any guidance on
                the size of the enclosure? The legislation is silent on all
                those matters and on where the responsibility will lie. Where
                legislation does not clearly state where responsibility lies,
                problems will occur. Inspection comes under this particular
                measure. Will there be inspections? If so, by whom? What powers
                of entry will the inspectors have, and when does the dog have to
                be confined?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third requirement is that the dog be
                excluded from places specified in the order. If an accompanied
                dog goes into an excluded area what action is to be taken, and
                by whom? The legislation does not give any guidance, nor does it
                suggest that there is any sanction to be applied other than to
                follow the same procedure all over again.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fourth requirement is that dogs shall be
                neutered, and — I like this — it adds in brackets</p>

                is a male&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not being mischievous, but how will the
                court make that determination? Before I get any suggestions, I
                assume that the dog will not be in the courtroom for the judge
                to decide. Without drawing pictures, it might be easy to
                determine whether a pit bull terrier was male or otherwise, but
                there might be difficulties with one of these long-coated hairy
                dogs. Are councils required to provide this information to the
                courts to facilitate such a determination? Although the Bill
                does not say so, I assume that the courts will require a
                veterinary certificate, or something similar, to confirm that
                the male dog has been neutered.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The matter of timescale goes across each of
                these four issues. Should the legislation not require the courts
                to specify a period within which compliance would be required?
                It is not currently the case, and it has caused problems for
                many local authorities. They have brought a successful
                prosecution, and the courts have specified, for instance,
                destruction, but this has not occurred. The only measure open to
                those councils is to repeat the process and show that the court
                order has been defied. There should be a clear timetable for a
                court order to be carried out.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As we are dealing with a Dogs Bill, I am
                disappointed there is nobody from the PUP present. I would have
                thought that the PUPs would have been the first to be present
                for this piece of legislation — I had to get that in
                somewhere.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill has defects, and when it is
                operating at local government level, those defects will be more
                keenly seen. I would prefer a delay so that there can be proper
                consultation. If these matters can be raised after one phone
                call, what would proper consultation produce? Would the
                legislation not be improved if there were more clarity on these
                issues?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In calling Mr Jim Shannon, may I ask for
                brevity as there are no amendments. This is merely an
                opportunity for comment.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to make a couple of points,
                though not as eloquently as Mr Robinson.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clause 1(2) refers to alternative measures
                such as the muzzling, keeping a dog confined, keeping the dog in
                certain places, and having the dog neutered. Who will monitor
                these alternatives? I presume this will be the responsibility of
                the council. From where will the funds and the time for this
                come? I would like some clarification with regard to the
                monitoring process. The provision refers to the action a court
                can take if a dog has worried livestock. The outcome could be
                that the animal is not put down. Is that good or bad thinking? A
                dog that attacks livestock gets the taste for the chase, the
                taste for the blood. More often than not, it cannot be deterred
                from that activity. If a dog worries livestock there is really
                only one measure that can be taken, and there should be no
                alternative.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clause 1(3) provides for discretion. That is
                important. As elected representatives we have come across cases
                where a dog has been playful and has not viciously attacked
                anyone, yet a destruction order has been made against it.
                Current legislation states that a physical attack can mean
                physically harming the person, but it could also refer to the
                threat of attack or to someone living in fear of attack. A dog
                that playfully pushes someone over in an act of energetic
                exuberance would be destroyed as readily as an animal that
                viciously attacks someone. That has been the case until now. For
                that reason I welcome the changes. There has to be discretion,
                there has to be an alternative, and that option is in this
                legislation. However, the monitoring process needs
                clarification. Who will take charge of that? How will it be
                carried out? Finally, is it sufficient in the case of a dog that
                worries livestock to have any other alternative other than its
                being put down?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Agriculture and Rural
                Development (Ms Rodgers):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many issues have been raised. I will deal
                with some, but not all, of them today. Members could put down
                amendments at Further Consideration Stage. I will certainly
                consider everything that has been said today before the Bill
                returns to the House.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.30 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have noted Mr&nbsp;Robinson’s comments in
                relation to the fact that he did not bring this matter to the
                House’s attention at the Second Stage of the Bill. That is
                understandable, since he is not on the Agriculture and Rural
                Development Committee. However, there is perhaps the implication
                in what he said that the Committee Chairman, who happens to be
                the leader of his party, and two Committee members who are also
                in his party have been somewhat remiss in not bringing this to
                my attention before now. Having said that, I accept that the
                Member has raised issues, which I shall consider.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall deal first with the issue of
                consultation. The legislation was ready to go through by Order
                in Council but was held back by the fact that, it was hoped, the
                Assembly would come into being and deal with the matter. The
                legislation was ready to roll when the Assembly got up and
                running and was immediately brought before the House so that it
                might be put through quickly. What we are doing at the moment is
                something we could not have done without the Assembly and our
                new structures, for the legislation would simply have gone
                through as an Order in Council. Now, however, we are going
                through the democratic legislative process. Mr&nbsp;Robinson is,
                of course, entitled to bring his concerns before the House, and
                I shall consider them as Minister. At least we have that amount
                of consultation now, despite the fact that there was none
                earlier.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept that there are implications for
                district councils, but they are not onerous. To put this into
                perspective, destruction orders were served on 56&nbsp;dogs last
                year — roughly two per district council. There may be a number
                of appeals, and it could well be a matter of one dog per
                district council. There will be no huge monetary costs or
                onerous implications for them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The question was raised about whether the
                court would have enough discretion. I can think of no other
                party which should have such discretion apart from the court.
                People can, in a sense, make their case in a court — they can
                appeal — and the court has been given discretion to consider
                that. The legislation is based on that which exists in Great
                Britain, where it is generally thought to be satisfactory, and I
                am not aware of any complaints.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Member wishes to table further
                amendments for consideration, we shall deal with them when the
                time comes. However, it is important to get ahead with this
                change, for as the Member will be aware, there has been great
                public demand for this legislation and for us to bring our laws
                into line with those in Great Britain. One must also remember
                that that the court will apply the penalty only if an attack is
                proved. It will not simply do what is laid down in the
                legislation without giving consideration to the views put before
                it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to Mr Shannon’s views on
                sheep-worrying, the present position is that the dog will be put
                down. I thank him for the welcome he gave to the Bill and the
                need to have flexibility. He is clearly articulating the public
                demand.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall sum up by saying to Mr&nbsp;Robinson
                and Mr&nbsp;Shannon that I have taken note of the issues they
                have raised. As Members are aware, they may table amendments for
                the Further Consideration Stage. I shall, of course, consider
                all their views in the meantime. There is, however, no
                possibility of removing the flexibility this Bill gives us, for
                it is a response to public demand. If there are areas where
                Members believe the Bill can be improved or clarified, we should
                certainly look at their ideas at the Further Consideration
                Stage.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is hardly worthwhile speaking, for I
                raised a series of issues during the discussion on clause 1, and
                the Minister spoke to only one of them — and even then managed
                to miss the point I was making. I hope she will look at the
                issues raised in the report of these proceedings. I would rather
                be given answers to my questions than put down amendments,
                particularly if they are unnecessary.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to raise only one issue on clause 2.
                This provision relates to articles 25A and 25C of the Dogs
                (Northern Ireland) Order 1983, as amended by the Dangerous Dogs
                (Northern Ireland) Order 1991. It refers primarily to dogs such
                as pit bull terriers and dogo argentino. Under the current
                legislation, as I understand it, it is an offence to keep any of
                these dogs unless the keeper is in possession of a valid
                certificate of exemption and complies with specified conditions
                on how the dog is to be kept and controlled. If those conditions
                are not fully met, the keeper is in breach of article 25A of the
                Dogs (Northern Ireland) Order 1983 and is liable to prosecution.
                If he is convicted, the court shall make an order directing that
                the dog, in respect of which the offence was committed, be
                destroyed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have some concerns about the bad
                administrative practices or the misbehaviour of owners resulting
                in dogs being destroyed. Presumably no one would suggest that it
                is the dog’s fault that the provisions laid down were not kept
                by the owner. I understand that this new provision means that on
                conviction of an offence under article 25A, the court would make
                an order directing the dog to be destroyed, and will do so
                unless it is satisfied that the dog will not be a danger to the
                public. Are there circumstances where the court could take into
                consideration the willingness of another person to become the
                owner of the dog? This might make the court believe that the dog
                would not be a danger to the public, providing it was satisfied
                that the new owner would behave in a more responsible manner.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, there is the matter of a dog
                being kept during the two months given to obtain the necessary
                certificate of exemption. The main concern is that the dog would
                be likely to disappear during that period, given that the owner
                would be the person in default and might not be regarded as a
                responsible individual. If, to prevent that possibility, a dog
                is held in a secure place approved by the court, who will pay
                for kennelling costs? Is that to be a cost on district councils?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must bear in mind that the opportunity
                given by the Bill to legalise the dog — if we might use that
                term — is being offered to someone who has been found guilty
                of an offence. The dog may have been seized in a public place or
                removed from his home as a result of a warrant being issued. Is
                it not reasonable to suggest that the dog be held in secure
                conditions, rather than being returned to the owner’s care,
                from where it could escape or otherwise disappear?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will take legal advice and come back to the
                Member with regard to the matter of dangerous dogs, because
                complicated legal issues are involved. He asked who meets the
                cost of complying with any restrictions that district councils
                put on dog owners. Costs are borne by the dog owner, and not the
                district council. We are talking about very small numbers. I
                will also take legal advice about what discretion courts might
                have to change the legal ownership of dogs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards the other questions to which the

                because I had no notice of them. There are issues involved which
                I, as a Minister, would be foolish to address off the top of my
                head. I have done my best to deal with those issues with which I
                am familiar. I look forward to the Further Consideration Stage,

                Yesterday, we debated the Executive’s draft Programme for
                Government. In calling for this debate my Committee wanted to
                ensure that Members also had the proper chance to scrutinise the
                Executive’s spending plan proposal for the incoming year and
                to make our views and concerns known.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 17 October the Minister of Finance and
                Personnel presented the first Budget Proposal that has been
                prepared entirely under the discretion of the devolved
                Administration. At that stage the Minister remarked that the
                Budget constitutes a significant stage in the implementation of
                the Belfast Agreement and in the cementing of the new
                institutions. I agree, and, as was noted by a number of Members
                following the Minister’s announcement, the Assembly, through
                its Committees, has a statutory duty to consider and advise on
                departmental budgets in the context of the overall Budget
                allocation. My Committee believes that if it is to meet its
                statutory duty in the future, then all Assembly Committees will
                need to be given adequate time and opportunity to consider the
                Budget Proposal, and to co-ordinate their responses to the
                Minister of Finance and Personnel and the Executive Committee
                for consideration.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.45 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I think everyone would agree that the
                timescales adopted this year have prevented the kind of research
                and in-depth analysis that is desirable if Committees are to
                contribute to a report that adds real value to the Budget
                consideration process. There must be a firm commitment by the
                Executive Committee and the Minister of Finance and Personnel to
                adhere to a satisfactory programme in future years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the Committee’s view, this should be
                based upon an acceptance that the autumn session of the Assembly
                should open with the presentation of the Executive Committee’s
                Programme for Government. The Programme for Government should be
                followed immediately by a Budget proposal. This will give
                significant time for the process of analysis and consideration.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, each Department has a duty to
                ensure that its Committee has the information it needs to
                perform its statutory role in scrutinising and considering, and
                advising on, the departmental Estimates. It is our view that
                this process should commence in the spring and early summer of
                each year when the Departments are giving initial consideration
                to the formulation of the following year’s Estimates.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A LeasCheann Comhairle, I do not intend to go
                into the details of the Budget. Today’s debate will enable my
                Committee to listen to the issues that are raised, to form its
                proposals and to advise the Minister accordingly. I want to mark
                up, as I did yesterday, the issue of using the rates as a means
                of taxation to finance the Budget. That issue has come up in the
                Committee, and we need to discuss it. The purpose of this debate
                is to give Members the opportunity to raise their concerns, to
                give their support to the various provisions and to ask
                questions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That will enable my Committee to co-ordinate
                a response to the Minister of Finance and Personnel that
                encapsulates the views of the Assembly and its Committees. Go
                raibh maith agat.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for Higher
                and Further Education, Training and Employment (Dr Birnie):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will start with the Barnett formula because
                I imagine that many Members will wish to comment on it and its
                impact on our Budget. Clearly, its impact is not satisfactory.
                By definition as a formula, it is somewhat rigid and mechanical.
                Undoubtedly, when Mr&nbsp;Barnett, as he then was, devised the
                formula in the 1970s he did not intend it to be a long-term
                arrangement. Indeed, I understand that he has recently implied
                that he is surprised that it is still in use a quarter of a
                century later.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The formula does give a certain set
                percentage increase for Northern Ireland public expenditure.
                Northern Ireland’s population is taken as a percentage of
                either the population figure for England or the Great Britain
                population figure, depending on which change or base in public
                expenditure is most appropriate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For example, that affects the case of the
                Department of Higher and Further Education, Training and
                Employment, where there are clear cases of needs in Northern
                Ireland exceeding the relative percentage share of population.
                The percentage of long-term unemployment in Northern Ireland
                exceeds that in England. In percentage terms, there are also
                more 18- to 21-year-olds, and there are greater training needs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What then must be done? First, I applaud the
                fact that the Northern Ireland Executive had success during the
                summer in negotiations with the Treasury in London, when the aim
                was to get a fairer base with respect to the changes in public
                expenditure in either England or Great Britain, which would then
                be set up for comparison and multiplication through the formula
                to give the Northern Ireland increase.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We could commission a fully fledged needs
                assessment to shift the measurements of increases in public
                expenditure in Northern Ireland from the rather mechanical and
                rigid Barnett-type formula to one based on an assessment of
                needs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We could even — though this is a
                longer-term and perhaps tentative suggestion — allocate
                Northern Ireland a certain percentage of tax revenues that are
                collected locally. We could move closer towards the sort of
                federal system of revenue sharing that operates in a number of
                countries around the world.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the same time, Members must recognise that
                the &quot;begging bowl&quot; approach — as it might be
                derogatorily described in some quarters — does have dangers.
                In some sectors a needs assessment might lead to Northern
                Ireland receiving a smaller percentage increase than it
                currently does because there are greater social needs in certain
                sectors in Wales or Scotland. When negotiating with the
                Treasury, Northern Ireland can only plead its special case
                status for so long. We have an opportunity to do that at the
                moment, but it will not last for ever. Northern Ireland’s GDP
                per capita is already higher than that of some regions in Great
                Britain, and its unemployment rate is lower than the European
                Union average.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yesterday we received advance notice of the
                provision in the Budget for cross-budget activities and the
                implementation bodies. Their budget amounts to approximately
                0·2% of the roughly £6 billion in the departmental expenditure
                limits. The total employment in the six implementation bodies in
                Northern Ireland amounts to several hundred, compared to a
                central Civil Service employment in Northern Ireland of 20,000.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I raise those statistical comparisons for the
                sake of some Members in this corner of the House who seem
                agitated about the extent of North/South activity. Those Members
                should recognise that much of that employment relates to
                activity that has been going on for many years — for example,
                running and maintaining waterways and maintaining lighthouses.
                Don Quixote attacked windmills; some Members of the DUP probably
                want to attack North/South lighthouses.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Member agree that attacking
                windmills is better than tilting at windmills, which he appears
                to be doing at present?</p>
                <b>

                Colleagues did so yesterday.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Higher and Further Education, Training
                and Employment Committee is disappointed by the small budget
                allocation to the critical area of adult basic education. That
                is especially so given the well-documented problems of adult
                illiteracy and innumeracy. That may be linked to my previous
                point, considering that there are problems with basic
                mathematics in some quarters in the House regarding the
                proportional importance of the six North/South implementation
                bodies.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGrady:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate the Minister and the Executive
                on their first independent Budget for Northern Ireland. In many
                ways, however minuscule, it tries to reflect local needs rather
                than those of the United Kingdom. I hope that that development
                will continue over the years as more knowledge is gained and
                more flexibility can be created.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the opening paragraph of his presentation
                the Minister made a very significant remark. He said that the
                Executive was disappointed that the increase in spending power
                that Northern Ireland received was markedly less than the
                increases applied to England, Scotland and Wales. The Minister
                went on to say that Northern Ireland could continue to press for
                a more equitable and sustainable approach to the allocation of
                spending.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie mentioned the Barnett principle,
                which, I think, is the kernel of the problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He expressed a cautionary approach, but I
                have no doubt that if we were to examine what has been happening
                over the years, we could clearly illustrate the ongoing annual
                shortfall in the block grant, as it is commonly known. I have
                listened to departmental debates for several months now, and I
                am shocked by how much Northern&nbsp;Ireland has been neglected
                during direct rule. This can be seen by the underspend on
                railways to the point where they are now unsafe, the gross and
                obvious underspend on the roads programme and the
                £80&nbsp;million that is required to replace the entire water
                and sewerage distribution system which is also in a state of
                emergency. Why were we not told all of this during the years of
                direct rule? Why was that kept from us, and why was this neglect
                allowed to accumulate so that it would become a burden for the
                new Executive?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recall a meeting with the then Minister,
                the good Lord, Lord&nbsp;Dubs, in December&nbsp;1998 when
                privatisation of the shipyards was talked about, and the idea
                was that the resources raised from that privatisation would be
                used on the water system. It was obvious that they wanted to run
                fast with the privatisation of the harbour, but they held back
                on the £80&nbsp;million required for the water and sewerage
                services so that the Assembly could deal with it. That was
                deliberate, and I am sure the same applied to roads, railways,
                water, sewerage and health; the hidden burden was being pushed
                forward until devolution took place, and then we would be left
                to deal with it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I suggest to the Minister and the Executive
                that we re-examine what has happened over the last few decades,
                measure the shortfall in capital investment and compare it with
                that in England, Scotland and Wales. We should then renegotiate
                and say that we have been underfunded, that our block grant
                falls short of the requirement to sustain Northern&nbsp;Ireland’s
                infrastructure on the same basis as that in the remainder of the
                United&nbsp;Kingdom. We should then request that that funding be
                reinstated, maybe through a 10-year programme, so that we can
                catch up in those areas that have been neglected in the past.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr&nbsp;Birnie suggested that in future the
                Barnett principle should be dealt with on a needs-assessment
                basis rather than on a mathematical formula, because that does
                not address any of the real needs and issues of the communities
                that we represent. I do not intend to address any constituency
                and parochial matters, however tempting that may be, I will
                merely deal with some very broad departmental issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have referred to the problem that was
                highlighted regarding the £80&nbsp;million required for the
                updating of our railway system to the relevant safety
                requirements. The Department for Regional Development must spend
                money to address the public safety aspect, and an attempt must
                be made to modernise what is an antiquated railway system, but
                we must be conscious of the fact that the railway system serves
                only a limited geographical area in Northern&nbsp;Ireland. Many
                in the Six Counties do not have access to railways, but I would
                like to think that there will be the same importance and the
                same determination to achieve funding to improve our roads
                infrastructure as there has been to improve the railway system.
                If we boil this down to safety issues, many more are killed on
                our roads than on our railways, although that is a very crude
                criterion by which to judge the importance of the spending
                priorities. We will have to balance what we are doing on
                transport infrastructure between railways and roads. Roads must
                be given a much greater priority. There has been a gross and
                obvious underspend in that area over the years, and the state of
                repair of our roads is deteriorating as we speak.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I represent a rural constituency, it will
                come as no surprise that I have great concerns about the future
                of rural communities. I am not just referring to farming
                incomes. I am concerned about the future of our rural
                communities in general — farmers, rural workers, rural
                dwellers and small factories, all of which are currently under
                siege.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They are not just earning a living from the
                land or the locality. We should be aware they are also the
                custodians of the countryside and of our natural assets. Unless
                we address that issue in a more dynamic way, that which we all
                love and value, and which we should be utilising as a natural
                earning asset through tourism, will be dissipated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will give one small example. We are all
                aware of the problem of public safety. In my constituency the
                sheep farmers have been banned from using the Mournes. That has
                had a direct impact upon their income, yet it has been done on
                behalf of all of us, but they are still not getting any real
                compensation for this. If they are banned up to the year 2005,
                as is anticipated, the natural environment, which has had sheep
                grazing on it for centuries, will change dramatically. It will
                cost as much to maintain it in a normal and natural state as it
                would to compensate the farmers to keep them on the land. They
                should be engaged in that process and employed on environmental
                works to keep this natural resource. One can apply that argument
                anywhere in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must have a more dynamic approach if we
                want to sustain a proper rural community. Farming is not the
                only way to do that. We must consider a small business approach
                to farming. At present we do not do that. We hive off farming to
                the Department of Agriculture, and we talk about stock, fodder
                and transport costs. However, it is much more than that. These
                are small businesses, and we must adopt a LEDU or IDB approach
                to sustaining them. We must make it possible for farm products
                leaving the farm gate to be deliverable on the world market and
                to be of the highest possible quality.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment must take an interest in the huge workforce which
                exists in the rural community, and which has not been addressed
                as a workforce. They are treated as individuals who do not
                count. They do count. We are going to rue it if we do not give
                them full and proper consideration.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My greatest worry — this is true of every
                Member of the Assembly — relates to the provision of good
                quality, locally accessible healthcare. If we are all honest
                about it, we will admit having had personal experience of a
                general deterioration in the Health Service. There may be many
                reasons why that is so, but there are a couple of matters that
                should be addressed immediately. I was interested to note the
                reference in the Minister of Finance’s paper to the creation
                of a service modernisation fund, with the aspirations of cutting
                out bureaucracy and creating efficiency and value for money.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first target should be the Health Service
                in Northern Ireland. We need to remove the bureaucracy, to get
                away from the inefficiencies in the purchasing and supplying of
                services, and to redirect the funding from administration back
                to the delivery of the service and to the treatment of patients
                in our hospitals and surgeries.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">More money should be released for spending
                locally, which is the aspiration whether we like it or not.
                Whether it is contrary to the dictates of the Royal Colleges or
                not, our people want a health service in their local areas. We
                need to address efficiency and bureaucracy and challenge the
                validity of the vested interests dictating to us over the
                delivery of our healthcare.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also want to touch upon local government. A
                point was made in the media early this morning — in order to
                catch the early media worm — on the regional rate, which has
                gone up by 6·6%. This has always been a bug bear for those of
                us who have served in local government over the years — it has
                a long history. I remember questioning the basis upon which the
                regional rate was cast year after year. I now regret my response
                to that because I was told by Minister and civil servant alike
                not to rock the boat. They said I was doing all right, to keep
                quiet and not to fudge it. I regret that I did not insist on
                having a full, public, detailed analysis of how that money was
                being spent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the rates bill comes through my door,
                and through the doors of every household in Northern Ireland, I
                want to see what services will be provided with the money being
                demanded of me. We know the history of this. Macrory
                restructured local government in 1972. Responsibility for
                health, education, water, sewerage, roads and planning were all
                transferred to central Government, and the regional rate was to
                cover that — they were previously funded by local rates. It is
                only since then that the regional rate has come into being to
                assess ratepayers for services that were regionally provided.
                Depending on what everyone says about reorganisation and the
                restructuring of local government, we can immediately address
                the issue of how that regional rate is spent on health,
                education, water, sewerage, roads and planning, big spending
                areas. We can tell the ratepayers what is happening and we will
                be able to see whether there is efficiency or not and whether we
                are getting a fair deal or not. With the splitting of the
                regional and the local rate, there is a danger that people are
                being doubly taxed, and I think that matters should be made
                absolutely clear and precise. I would like to think that there
                will be greater efficiency and that the regional rate increases,
                that grow year on year squeezing local government, will be
                addressed in a more scientific and open manner.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, there is the question of whether the
                Northern Ireland Executive should seek to have some powers in
                respect of local government and local taxation. Scotland took it
                upon itself to have a 3% tax-varying power. I am not talking
                about increased taxation but rather about greater flexibility in
                how we deliver the services we have to deliver across the board.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have spoken of certain areas that have
                required an enormous amount of funding over the years. I recall
                an opinion poll — it did not translate into votes, which most
                of us will be very conscious about — that said that the
                English electorate would vote wholeheartedly to suffer the
                burden of increased taxation if it were ring-fenced and devoted
                to the provision of a better Health Service. I hasten to admit
                that that did not translate into votes at the subsequent
                election. I am not advocating increased taxation; I am just
                saying that it is something we should look at to see if we in
                Northern Ireland could have some flexibility with general
                taxation which would allow us to catch up with, or surpass, the
                better infrastructure of some of our neighbouring countries in
                this new millennium.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would have to be equitable, and it would
                have to be endured by those who could afford it rather than
                those who could not, and with our local thinking we could come
                to a reasonable arrangement. I hope the Minister and the
                Executive will address this problem — maybe not this year but
                some time in the not-too-distant future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, I would like again to
                emphasise my party’s appreciation to the Minister and the
                Executive for the Programme for Government and the Budget. I am
                sure it has not been an easy task. I have just one question
                left. It has been said in the House that the Budget follows the
                Programme for Government and that if we aspire to do something
                then we must pay for it. I suspect that, because of the block
                grant’s construction and its finite terms, in many instances
                the programme follows the budget. We cannot raise the finances
                to pay for what we want to do. We can only decide what we can do
                when we get the finances. That is not good housekeeping, and it
                is not good government. It is not the way to address local
                issues and I think that is another good reason to look at some
                aspects of the local tax situation.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have been told that the Budget increase on
                the figure for the current financial year is approximately
                7·3%. While that is quite a hefty figure, as the Minister
                pointed out in his statement to the House several weeks ago, it
                is significantly lower than Scotland, Wales and England.
                Therefore we are not reaping the same benefits as other parts of
                the United Kingdom from the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s
                largesse running up to the next election.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to press the Minister about the
                way Northern Ireland is being treated under the Barnett formula.
                I know he has made representations with others to the Treasury
                in the past, but I would like him to spell out what he plans to
                do in the medium term to address Northern Ireland’s
                underfunding in the block grant situation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">May I also press him, although I am talking
                generally at this stage, about the Executive programme fund.
                These were praised by a number of speakers when the statement
                was first made in the House and have been referred to this
                morning. There is to be £16 million set aside in next financial
                year, £100 million the following year, and £200 million the
                year after that. Yet we have had no indication so far of what
                the indicative figures would be for allocations to Departments
                over the next two to three years. I would like to know exactly
                when the Minister proposes to give us those figures. We have the
                figures for next financial year, but I think it is important to
                have some idea for years thereafter — even if they are only
                indicative.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While people are welcoming the Executive
                programme funds I take it that the Minister will be confirming
                that there is no extra or new money involved here. Money that
                would otherwise have been allocated to Departments will be held
                back until later in the financial year. In effect, there is not
                going to be the promise or indication that this is new or extra
                money at all. In fact, this money is part of the Northern
                Ireland block and will simply be taken from Departments, put
                into the Executive and then handed back out again.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would also like an indication from the
                Minister about the Programme for Government, which we debated
                yesterday. A number of Members indicated that there were some
                broad and sweeping statements, many of an aspirational nature.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When one analyses some of these statements it
                becomes clear that moneys have not been allocated at all in some
                cases, or that inadequate funds have been allocated to meet some
                of the targets which Departments bid for funding for. To what
                extent does the Minister feel that the Programme for Government
                and many of the actions therein have been adequately funded, and
                which of those have not been funded at all, in this year’s
                Budget? That would be very interesting and enable us to measure
                what the impact of the Programme for Government will be in real
                terms. It is all very well to talk about aspirations and
                visions. We all know that if no money is allocated to fund these
                programmes, then very little is going to change in the standard
                of living of our constituents.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Turning to the timetable, there is a general
                feeling that both the way we have looked at these issues and the
                time we have been given have been inadequate. The Minister has
                been pressed on this in Committee. Can he assure us that in
                future years, if indeed there are future years and the Minister
                is still in place, we will not be in this position of having to
                rush our consideration of the Budget?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the introduction of resource
                budgeting and accounting, as this will place more emphasis on
                the setting of output and target measures. That is a positive
                step, and I hope that it will continue in years to come. I am
                sure that it will.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the Minister introduced the Budget
                statement on 17 October he said that these would not be a set of
                hand-me-down Budget proposals that simply rolled forward plans
                inherited from the period of direct rule. He referred to the
                previous year, when exactly that happened, for understandable
                reasons. However, the Minister was at pains to stress that on
                this occasion we would not be doing that. He said that this
                would be the first evidence of how we will begin to make a
                difference. I imagine that that whetted the appetites of some
                people and led them to believe that we would see some very
                different approaches to issues that have been difficult in the
                past. Earlier, Mr McGrady mentioned one such issue, the regional
                rate. However, the Minister then said</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Executive has decided to roll
                forward the increase of 8% in the domestic regional rate which
                was assumed at the time of the 1998 comprehensive spending
                review.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Obviously, he was not just rolling it forward
                from the previous year. He was taking it forward from the 1998
                comprehensive spending review, despite his having said earlier
                that we would not be engaged in the business of bringing forward
                a set of hand-me-down budget proposals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not see much difference under devolution
                this year compared to the last number of years. The percentage
                increase in the regional rate is going to be exactly the same
                — far and away above the rate of inflation. I have not seen
                the Minister bring forward any justification for that, except to
                say that without this increase we could not have made the
                allocations that were made in the Budget. That goes without
                saying. The non-domestic regional rate is to rise by 6·6%,
                which will have a major impact on costs for industry and
                employers. That will, in turn, make us less competitive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Obviously, if we increased the regional rate
                by the rate of inflation, we would not have as much money.
                Anyone can understand that point, but where is the justification
                for an increase of this magnitude? Look at the outcry that there
                has been, and rightly so, at the suggestion. I notice that some
                of the people who have been waxing eloquent about this issue
                have become silent when it comes to the rates, an issue that
                clearly bears upon many householders in Northern Ireland who are
                on low incomes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What about the issue of the increase in
                Housing Executive rents? It is suggested — or assumed — for
                the purposes of housing benefit that they might increase by GDP
                plus 2%, but people are saying that that is far too high. When I
                was Minister for Social Development I indicated that I wanted it
                brought down to the level of inflation, but this figure of 8%
                has been thrown out here on the grounds that that is what it was
                in previous years, and if it does not continue at that level,
                there will be less money. That is unacceptable. The Minister
                needs to go away and rethink this issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many Members of this House are local
                councillors, and we know all about the misrepresentation on a
                rates bill. When the rates bill arrives, people pick it up and
                say &quot;Look at Lisburn Council&quot; — I cite Lisburn
                because I am looking at Mr Davis — &quot;and what it is doing.
                Look at the size of its rates bill.&quot; I am not looking at Mr
                Robinson, of course, because people in Castlereagh never say
                that; they look at their rates bills and say &quot;My, what a
                wonderfully low rates bill&quot;. They then go on to say
                &quot;But look at the size of the regional rates bill&quot;.
                Most councils in Northern Ireland have been reasonably prudent
                in managing their local rates and the burden that they place on
                ratepayers, but year after year the Government step in and
                increase the regional rate far above the rate of inflation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGrady mentioned the idea of
                transparency. People should know exactly what they are paying
                for when these rates bills come through. That is right, but the
                problem is that the Minister has already made it known that this
                is just a general means of raising money. It is a taxation
                measure. We pressed him on this in the Committee. We asked him
                if the money that is being raised through the regional rate will
                be linked to expenditure on water or sewerage or any issue that
                is ring-fenced in any way, and he admitted that it was not. It
                is a general tax, which goes into the general pot and is then
                distributed as he and this Assembly sees fit. When we talk about
                taxation and tax-raising powers it is therefore clear that the
                Minister is a tax-raising Minister as far as the regional rate
                is concerned.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member is over-simplifying the situation.
                He knows well — and I am sure he will agree — that if the
                regional rate is not paid, then provision for the funding of
                water, sewerage, electricity, health and education will have to
                be included in the district rate. The ratepayer will still pay
                — as he always has done — for those services. We need
                transparency and then we will know whether the amount is right
                or wrong.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to deal with how we can improve the
                situation. It would be wrong if we were simply to stand here and
                say &quot;We should not have this rate increase&quot; or if we
                were to criticise certain aspects of what the Minister proposes
                without suggesting alternatives. That would be irresponsible,
                and I will deal with the matter shortly. The point I want to
                make now is that it is simply unacceptable for the Minister to
                come here and talk in generalities about needing this because
                otherwise we would not get the money in.</p>

                service or product. By doing things this way, the Minister is
                pulling a figure out of the air and giving no justification for
                the amount. It is simply a top-up tax to meet his final figure.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member is absolutely right. This was
                backed up, and the Minister agreed with that analysis at the
                Committee. In previous years there may have been an attempt to
                link the money raised through the regional rate to expenditure
                on water and sewerage, but the Minister has made it absolutely
                clear that that is no longer the case. The money goes into the
                general pot and is distributed widely, as the Executive sees
                fit. What concerns me is that no proper justification whatsoever
                has been given for such a large tax increase, way above the rate
                of inflation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Maybe one of the reasons why the Minister
                felt that he had to put forward such an increase was the
                provision for additional departmental running costs as a result
                of the devolution arrangements put in place because of the
                Belfast Agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 2000-01 an extra £26·1 million is being
                spent on running the Civil Service bureaucracy, not on
                delivering services or giving people the things they need to
                improve the quality and standard of their life. There will be
                another £26·1 million next year. That is £52·2 million so
                far. It will continue in the years after that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposed Civic Forum will cost £300,000
                to get up and running next year. Dr Birnie and his party, as
                enthusiastic advocates of the all-Ireland dimension, sought to
                justify expenditure on the North/South bodies. However, he would
                have better spent his time considering the fact that £8·2
                million will be spent on that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister sent a letter dated 24 October
                to the Finance Committee, in which he said that expenditure on
                North/South bodies in 2000-01 was £8·2 million. Another
                document from the Minister, dated 12&nbsp;October, says that
                costs for North/South bodies for the same year were £8·9
                million. Perhaps I can help the Minister to clarify that. In one
                letter he tries to leave out the costs of the North/South
                tourism body, whereas in his original letter he includes those
                costs. They should be included, as it is one of the North/South
                bodies. The total expenditure on North/South bodies next year,
                including the North/South tourism body and the North/South
                Ministerial Council, comes to almost £18·1 million.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister recently told the House
                that expenditure would be about £11 million. He seemed to think
                that that was a trivial amount — why were we getting so
                exercised about over £11 million? The real figure is nearer
                £20 million when what should be added in is added in. The
                Minister himself added in these factors in his letter of
                12&nbsp;October to the Finance Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are those who say that we should not
                get too exercised about expenditure on the all-Ireland dimension
                of the Belfast Agreement. Perhaps they can justify this to their
                constituents: for every million pounds spent on the all-Ireland
                political dimensions of the Belfast Agreement, 200 extra heart
                operations could be carried out, 25 houses might be built for
                the homeless, or 1,000 homes could be adapted for disabled
                people. Some money has been allocated for that in this Budget,
                but not enough to deal with the demand in the community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members who represent their constituencies
                face the daily demand for work to be carried out to adapt homes
                so that people can live in their own homes in a safe, decent and
                proper way. For a million pounds we could put central heating in
                300 family homes. Look at fuel poverty: 170,000 homes in
                Northern Ireland still do not have adequate heating. Six hundred
                people —</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can the Member explain the basis for his
                confidence that if the structures of devolved government,
                including the North/South bodies, were not here, and instead we
                had direct rule, the money saved would be spent on the services
                that he has mentioned, such as heart operations and heating for
                Housing Executive houses?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would have very little confidence if I were
                putting the matter in the hands of direct rule Ministers.
                However, Members will have an opportunity to vote on the matter.
                I hope that those who are concerned about these issues will go
                through the Lobbies in favour of these things. Any who so wish
                may vote against, but that will be a decision for them and no
                one else. They will be responsible, answerable and accountable,
                and no doubt the people will hold them accountable.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I well remember the words of the Deputy
                Leader of the Ulster Unionist Party about a year and a half ago
                — I have not seen much of him since then — in one of the
                earliest debates we had in this House, when we raised the issue
                of the cost of the present system of devolved government and
                quangos. We have yet to see any proposals for a reduction in the
                number of quangos.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All we have heard about is a review of public
                administration. We have heard about it outside this House when
                it has been discussed at conferences for local government chief
                executives, at party political conferences, and in the media.
                However, there has been no ministerial statement — and we all
                know that we have ministerial statements on virtually every
                subject at the drop of a hat — about what this review of
                public administration is going to entail. No one has told us
                what it means, how long it will take, what it is going to cost,
                what the targets are, or what it hopes to achieve. However,
                Ministers have been at pains to say, in the Programme for
                Government, and in previous statements to this House, that one
                of the key reasons why it is not necessary to get so exercised
                about the costs of devolution is because these costs will come
                down when we get rid of these layers of bureaucracy. All I have
                seen so far is the building up of more layers of bureaucracy —
                the Civic Forum, North/South implementation bodies, and so on.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then we look at the departmental running
                costs. I would be interested to know how the Minister will
                justify some of the figures that we have for increases in
                departmental running costs. In the case of the Office of the
                First Minister and Deputy First Minister — I take that as an
                example because it is the most glaring one — on page 37 ‘Budget
                2001/02’ speaks of an increase of 20·6% in the departmental
                running costs for next year. This is a Department that does not
                actually deliver any services directly to people. The cost is
                for administration and the running of various units and
                departments that have been set up within the Office of the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister. That is something that
                needs to be addressed.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will be very brief.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister — I mean the Member; I do not
                want to elevate him too soon, although after this morning’s
                performance he may get an approach — had an opportunity to say
                something on a number of issues, some of which I have already
                highlighted, during his own remarks.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have already mentioned issues such as fuel
                poverty. I have mentioned homes being adapted, and so on. Money
                could be diverted from some of the expenditure on political
                correctness, bureaucracy, and all-Ireland, political North/Southery.
                That money would be better spent on addressing issues like fuel
                poverty. Other Members will have an opportunity to raise other
                issues. There are issues such as kitchen and bathroom
                replacements in the homes of people on low incomes who
                desperately need them. There are issues like the North Belfast
                strategy, which is one of the Housing Executive’s main
                priorities in view of the very pressing housing needs on both
                sides of the community in that area. There is also the need to
                maintain a proper, decent and adequate spending level on the
                maintenance of Housing Executive properties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">England and Wales are now paying the price of
                under- investment in maintenance over the years. They are now
                facing a massive bill to try and make up for under- investment.
                We in Northern Ireland have kept up a reasonable standard of
                maintenance. That must not be allowed to drift. We need to put
                more money into it. We need to look at the supporting area of
                weak community infrastructure. Money needs to be spent on that
                as well.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I urge the Minister to think carefully before
                he proceeds with the allocations he proposes in terms of the
                all-Ireland machinery and to divert that money to better uses.</p>

                </i><b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr J Kelly:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We learn of the crisis affecting the Health
                Service — bed shortages, patients on trolleys, waiting lists
                for cardiac and orthopaedic surgery, shortages of nurses, acute
                services in turmoil and insufficient primary services provision.
                In addition, winter pressures are bearing down on us earlier
                than was anticipated, while the problem with our Ambulance
                Service continue. The historic and ongoing underfunding of all
                levels of NHS health care must be acknowledged by the Assembly
                and by whoever is attempting to fund essential services in this
                part of Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The new revenue and investment on a per
                capita basis should be at least equivalent to the NHS national
                plan in Britain — this point should be indisputable.
                Nevertheless, in a recent ‘Belfast Telegraph’ article, John
                Simpson said that the Barnett formula, which was introduced in
                the late 1970s, has been responsible for reducing the
                differential between the per capita spend on health in the North
                of Ireland and that in England. In 1984, the per capita
                expenditure on health in the North of Ireland was 25% higher
                than that in England. This differential has now been reduced to
                five per cent. The formula for the division of extra money is
                calculated on the basis of the population of an area. The health
                needs of the people of the North of Ireland are much greater
                than the needs of the people of England. For instance, the
                coronary heart disease mortality rate is 20% higher in Northern
                Ireland than it is in England. John Simpson argues that, as a
                result, per capita expenditure on cardiology and cardiac
                surgical services in Northern Ireland should be 20% higher.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We could examine the history of how the
                Health Service in the North of Ireland has been diluted,
                underfunded and neglected over the years. Reckless,
                long-standing neglect of health services here is inextricably
                linked to the present acute crisis, and to deal with that there
                will have to be more planning than there has been to date. I
                suggest that a five-year plan, perhaps even a 10-year plan, is
                required to fund the Health Service, rather than periodic
                bandages in between recurring crises. That is how we have been
                treating the Health Service. We have not been caring as we ought
                for those at the cutting edge of the shortages in it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The challenge for the Assembly, a LeasCheann
                Comhairle, is to agree a strategy which will address the current
                emergency and enable our hospitals to deliver the first-class
                service which our patients and our old and infirm deserve well
                into this century. This Budget does not even begin to address
                our current problems, let alone our future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister might well ask where the money
                is to come from. In her proposal to the Executive, she requested
                £275 million. People said that that was money for a wish list.
                But as we look now at the formidable task before us, we can see
                that £275 million was far from money for a wish list. The £154
                million that she received will do no more than put a sticking
                plaster on the predicament which confronts us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whatever our political differences, we always
                agreed that the health of the people in the North of Ireland
                required our urgent attention. It is something that affects
                every Member of the Assembly, and it affects our families and
                the community. If we stand idly by we will be complicit in the
                neglect that has been inflicted on the Health Service over the
                last number of years. We must take some measures, however
                painful. We will not be forgiven if we do not treat this matter
                with the urgency it deserves.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have to go back to the Exchequer. We must
                make an urgent case to the Treasury, and those members of the
                Executive who are centrally involved in this must beg, plead or
                borrow to get the money from somewhere. However, we must not
                only address our existing problems but also formulate a strategy
                which will insure against repetition of this crisis. A neglected
                Health Service must become a thing of the past, and if it does
                the Assembly will be seen to have addressed health and the care
                of our old, young and infirm as our first priority.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This draft Budget is inextricably linked to
                the draft Programme for Government that was discussed yesterday.
                For the sake of consistency I pose the same question as I posed
                yesterday. What opportunity have the statutory Committees had to
                consider this draft Budget? I use the word &quot;consider&quot;
                deliberately, because that was the word used by the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister when they introduced the
                draft programme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to emphasise that statutory Committees
                have a more important responsibility. The statutory Committees
                have a duty, a duty enshrined in law, to do much more than
                consider the draft Budget and the draft Programme for
                Government. They are obliged to scrutinise these documents, and
                scrutinise means to &quot;examine in minute detail&quot;. I
                contend that it is only after the completion of this scrutiny
                that they should come to the Assembly, we hope, for final
                agreement on a cross-community basis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I further contend that the opportunity for
                proper scrutiny has not yet been afforded to the Committees. It
                will not be possible to fulfil this statutory function
                adequately given the predetermined timescales within which we
                are operating. I would like to give Members a couple of
                examples.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Finance and Personnel Committee has spent
                weeks scrutinising the Ground Rents Bill. The Ground Rents Bill
                may well be an important piece of legislation. However, in terms
                of giving priority to scrutiny, and to the depth of that
                scrutiny, should we spend more time on a Ground Rents Bill than
                on a Budget that will affect every man, woman and child in this
                community. I know what my answer is. We should have been
                spending that time on our Budget. We should have been spending
                that time on ensuring that we get the Budget right. I feel,
                sadly, that we are being railroaded towards a vote on a Budget
                without proper scrutiny. That places a huge question mark over
                the word that has been used by so many people:
                &quot;transparency&quot;. It also places a question mark over
                the word to which we should all bow the knee, as it were:
                &quot;accountability&quot; — accountability to the people who
                elected us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having got that off my chest, I see that my
                primary role here today — this was mentioned by the Chairman
                of the Committee — as a member of the Finance and Personnel
                Committee, a Committee that should have an overarching role in
                budgetary matters, is to listen to the views of Members from
                other Committees in the House. No doubt there will be other
                opportunities for further constructive criticism of the Budget.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, as the regional rate falls directly
                within the purview of the Finance and Personnel Committee, I
                wish to take this opportunity to object in the strongest
                possible terms to the proposed 8% increase on this nebulous and
                iniquitous tax. I do so for a number of reasons, one of which
                was referred to by Mr Dodds when he quoted what the Minister
                said when he introduced the Budget on 17&nbsp;October. The
                Minister told us</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is a laudable approach which I commend.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, what happened then? When it came to
                the regional rate, we were told</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Executive has decided to roll
                forward the 8% increase in the domestic regional rate which was
                assumed at the time of the comprehensive spending review&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How could anyone in the House support that
                iniquity? Anyone who has been a member of a local authority, as
                the Minister has, for a number of years could not, cannot and
                should not support this iniquity that is called the regional
                rate. It is beyond me how anyone could support such a tax. I
                have been a councillor for 27½ years, and — hand on heart —
                in this time I have never heard a councillor throughout the land
                support the regional rate.</p>

                its shareholders as dividends, and the regional rate, which is
                redistributed in its entirety to the Northern Ireland economy?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes, sophisticated arguments like that work
                well. However, I am referring to the ordinary individual — you
                might call him Joe Citizen — who receives a bill in which he
                sees a 9% increase in electricity costs, or, if this proposal is
                carried, an 8% increase in the regional rate. He will draw no
                distinction between the two increases because the pound in his
                pocket will have been equally affected in each case.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Consider the effect on small businesses,
                which are the backbone of this economy. They will be hit by an

                The Minister? The Government? I will go further than that: I
                will blame anyone, any elected representative, who supports this
                increase. I am making it clear that neither I nor my party will
                indulge in this type of hypocrisy. The Alliance Party will
                support neither a budget nor a Programme for Government that is

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A day or two ago this Member was described in
                the House as being a slow learner. I am tempted to repeat that,
                but I will watch with interest, through you, Madam Deputy
                Speaker, to see how the Democratic Unionist Party votes on the
                regional rate. I will also watch with interest when we come to
                discuss the proposed increase in Housing Executive rents. We
                will wait and see.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Members have already stated, I have long
                articulated, both in the House and outside it, the need for the
                Assembly to have tax-varying powers — not tax-raising powers,
                as a Member said earlier. It may well be necessary to raise
                taxes in certain circumstances. I do not run away from that
                possibility, as Mr McGrady suggested. There are many advantages
                in ring-fencing particular taxes and making them attributable to
                certain increases in public expenditure. For example, I have no
                doubt that the people of Northern Ireland would agree to pay
                increased taxes to fund additional intensive care beds, and that
                is a different argument from the proposal to use the regional
                rate as a vehicle to increase taxes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am diametrically opposed to such use of the
                regional rate. Why? Because the regional rate fails all tests of
                what is a fair tax. It takes no account of one’s ability to
                pay. It is a regressive tax. It attacks those on fixed incomes.
                It militates against property improvements. A further tenet of
                good taxation is that those who strike and levy taxes should be
                accountable to the people on whom they levy those particular
                taxes. The Assembly must therefore be accountable to those whom
                it taxes. That would not happen with this &quot;sleight of hand
                tax&quot;, which in effect, passes the buck and the bill — at
                least in the eyes of the people — from the Assembly to local
                government. That is fundamentally wrong. Councillors are
                accountable to the electorate for the district rates they levy
                against their electorate. Councillors must not continue to be
                the whipping boys and girls for the actions of this, or any
                other, Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have referred to another area which gives
                me great cause for concern: the refusal of the Minister for
                Social Development to give an assurance to this House that
                Housing Executive rents will not increase beyond the level of
                inflation. We have heard many excuses for this refusal, but the
                reality appears to be that people were on the side of the poor
                Housing Executive tenants until they found themselves in
                positions of power. Only then were they prepared to burden those
                same tenants with inflation plus increases. How can anyone be so
                barefaced and then face the electorate?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I give notice that the Alliance Party will
                not accept such above inflation increases. We will honour our
                social consciences, and I call on other Members of this House to
                honour theirs. I realise my critics will point and say &quot;It
                is easy to say ‘Do not put this up, do not put that up, but
                where are you going to find the resources to fulfil a Programme
                for Government?’ &quot; This is where I return to my starting
                point. If only the Statutory Committees of the Assembly were
                given their proper scrutiny roles, I have no doubt we could find
                the necessary money. That could be done by cutting out wastage.
                Administration in every Department has merely rolled on from
                direct rule, although the Minister said we were not going to
                have anything rolling over. Have any of us in our Statutory
                Committees had the opportunity to look for efficiencies and
                savings which do not affect services? Have savings been found
                which do not cut back on services which people are expecting and
                demanding?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This topic came up yesterday during the
                so-called debate on the Programme for Government. The Executive
                in its wisdom has produced a document containing strategies,
                public service agreements and promises about what will happen.
                The Assembly has existed since 1998. We are fighting the same
                battles as last year. We are trying to get powers vested in
                Statutory Committees to do the jobs for which we were elected.
                We have a scrutiny role we have been unable to fulfil because we
                are told we have to work to predetermined timetables. That is
                wrong. We have to get our priorities right.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will give a further example. The Public
                Accounts Committee, of which I am a member, has had the
                opportunity to examine some Northern Ireland Audit Office
                reports. Anyone who has even a cursory glance through these
                reports will see the millions of pounds that have been wasted
                through inefficiency, inaccuracy and the mistaken expenditure of
                public money. We are an accountable body, and we must
                demonstrate that accountability by ensuring that all past
                wastage and maladministration is subjected to scrutiny, with
                improvements being made. I would much prefer to see that
                happening than to turn a blind eye and levy an 8% increase in
                the regional rate, the same as was enacted under an
                unsympathetic direct rule regime.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to speak on some Budget issues raised
                in the Social Development Committee. Various Ministers told the
                House that Targeting Social Need would be at the heart of all
                departmental spending policies. Nothing in this draft Budget
                comes remotely close to fulfilling that assurance. It will make
                the poor poorer and increase the economic and social exclusion
                felt by many in society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will illustrate that by making three or
                four brief points. Last year the Housing Executive budget was
                reduced by £14 million. Some additional resources were found
                later in the financial year, but the cut was still severe. Many
                of us thought that in this financial year, with local Ministers
                in charge, there would be a real possibility of an increase in
                that budget. How wrong we were. The Housing Executive budget
                will be reduced in real terms this year for the sixth
                consecutive year. The difference this year is that these cuts
                will be imposed by Ministers elected to this Assembly by the
                people of Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a result of the cuts in the Housing
                Executive budget, the planned housing programme for North
                Belfast has been, at best, shelved, yet few would disagree that
                the area has some of the worst housing conditions in western
                Europe. Where does cutting the Housing Executive budget, which
                has resulted in the north Belfast programme being taken out of
                the plans, fit into the overall strategy of targeting social
                need?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rents are programmed to rise next year by 2%
                above gross domestic product (GDP), or 4·5%. If the Social
                Development Committee were to recommend reducing rents in line
                with inflation, £5 million or £6 million would have to be cut
                from the Housing Executive budget. That would result in bathroom
                and kitchen replacement schemes for Housing Executive tenants
                having to be cancelled, another first for Targeting Social Need.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, some will attempt to argue that,
                since 80% of Housing Executive tenants claim housing benefit,
                these rent increases will affect only the remaining 20%. The
                argument is that 80% of tenants are protected from any increase,
                and since housing benefit is paid from the consolidated fund
                rather than the Northern Ireland block, this is a method of
                increasing Housing Executive moneys.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That may be true, but it shows a cynical
                disregard for the 20% who must pay full rents, including many
                senior citizens who have worked all their lives and accumulated
                small occupational pensions. These hard-earned pensions place
                such people above the benefit threshold, and they have to pay
                the Housing Executive rent, plus any increase, in full. While
                pensions rise by 2% this year, in line with inflation, Housing
                Executive rent increases, if unchecked, will rise by the same
                amount on average. Consequently, those people will be left even
                worse off.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many Housing Executive tenants in low-income
                jobs must pay the full rent. It is inevitable that those people
                will consider leaving employment and returning to welfare. If
                Targeting Social Need has any aim, surely it is the elimination
                of the poverty trap. Despite that, I stand here in a legislature
                that is supposed to be locally accountable, and contemplate the
                potential for widening that poverty trap.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Benefits are the only source of income for
                many people living on the margins of society. Last year alone,
                £7 million of income support benefit was unspent — moneys
                that should have gone to those in need. Unfortunately, this does
                not reveal the whole picture. Income support, as we all know, is
                a passport to other benefits. In reality, when we consider an
                underspend of £7 million in income support, we have to
                recognise that once other unallocated benefits are taken into
                account the real sum is probably in the region of £10 million
                to £12 million. What is the response of the Department for
                Social Development? It reduces, in real terms, the amount of
                money we allocate to advice services throughout the Province. I
                suppose that is in keeping with our policy of targeting social
                need.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How can we cut housing executive budgets,
                increase rents, reduce expenditure on advice giving services —
                all matters that impinge on the lives of people living on the
                margins in this society — while at the same time increase
                spending by £50 million to ensure that we can get the trains to
                run on time?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Lewsley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend the Minister on his Budget
                proposals and welcome the opportunity to comment on them. In
                particular, I would like to touch on the areas of equality,
                disability and education.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the commitment to a single equality
                Act because it will help develop a cross-departmental approach
                to community development. I also commend the policies relating
                to gender, race and disability. I ask the Minister what the
                impact will be on the statutory work of the Equality Commission
                if the £500,000 deficit in funding is not met.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is ongoing consultation between the
                Equality Commission and the Office of the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister with regard to this matter. Now that the
                issue of funding has been raised, I hope that it will be
                seriously addressed in future Budgets, if we are to take into
                consideration the recommendations made by the disability task
                force. Those recommendations would greatly enhance what is
                already in progress here in Northern Ireland in relation to
                equality.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Equality Commission is to engage in a
                full programme of activities, it is important to eliminate
                discrimination and promote equality across the range of issues
                for which the commission has responsibility, such as fair
                employment, gender equality, disability, race and, in
                particular, the statutory duties. Significant funding needs to
                be allocated to this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I very much welcome the £1 million allocated
                for disability within the commission and hope that it will help
                to target social need and promote social inclusion for one of
                the most disadvantaged sections of our population. This is a
                positive move towards redressing the current imbalance in
                provision for people with disabilities. I take this opportunity
                to add that I was delighted to see the issue of disability
                addressed in their own budget proposals across three of the
                Departments collectively in this Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment proposes to create 400 places on the access to work
                programme, 50 places on the employment support programme and 60
                work trials under the job introductory scheme. In addition, the
                Department for Social Development has allocated moneys to the
                Housing Executive to facilitate an increase in the number of
                adaptations to existing buildings, to provide access to about
                1,500 buildings for people with a disability. This will go some
                way to improving the access for disabled to avail of these
                increased jobs and training opportunities. Adding to that, the
                Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure has committed itself to
                making 40 venues across Northern Ireland accessible for people
                with a disability by 2001. With this combined effort across
                Departments, it can only be seen to promote access in both
                social and work facilities and a very positive move for
                inclusion for the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I turn now to the additional moneys made
                available for education. It appears that the allocation only
                allows for the maintenance of current spending, plus some extra
                to cover inflation. Northern Ireland is not getting a fair deal
                in money for education. Money allocated for education is not
                ring-fenced, unlike that in England, which goes directly from
                the Chancellor to schools.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland, along with Scotland and
                Wales, is evaluated under the Barnett formula, and the money
                actually goes into the block grant. Under the Barnett formula,
                only 3·3% is awarded, calculated on an overall population
                basis, which means that, in reality, there is a shortfall of
                some £7 million, compared to the allocation of extra funds in
                England. In fact, to have any impact we would have had needed at
                least 5%, and I am asking for the matter to be addressed in the
                revised Budget.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I had hoped that extra money would be
                allocated to help alleviate some of the areas of hardship in
                many schools, especially illiteracy, innumeracy and special
                educational needs. However, it appears that will not be the
                case. Under the social inclusion section of the Programme for
                Government, it is acknowledged that these areas will have a
                significant impact on social disadvantage. But in order for that
                to happen effectively, the £9·5 million earmarked for schools
                estates would need to be doubled. That will, in turn, help to
                address the current problems, continue development on an ongoing
                basis to ameliorate the issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The funding of education is an investment in
                our future, and we need to invest, not only to stop the system
                from deteriorating any further, but to develop a comprehensive
                and inclusive system of education which will reap benefits for
                our society in the short, medium and long terms.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a lot to be commended in the draft
                Budget proposal, and I appreciate that it is difficult to divide
                up the cake between competing Departments. However, it is
                imperative that we address the current inequalities and begin to
                work towards upgrading those services most in need, such as
                equality, education and disability.</p>

                additional £50 million for the railways as opposed to £20
                million actually in the Budget. Of course, we can excuse Mr
                Cobain — he has got his figures mixed up before, occasionally,
                and has had to eat his words. If he is prepared to give that
                money from the Department for Social Development to the
                Department for Regional Development, I am sure the Minister will

                interesting — very articulate, as usual, but that did not
                disguise the flaws. He talked a lot about the regional rate and
                how it was an immoral rate, a bad rate, a bad tax system. He
                used words such as despicable and detestable. What other system
                could replace the regional rate? Perhaps the Alliance Party
                could come up with something novel, more closely akin to the
                poll tax? Something, perhaps, that takes account of individuals,
                unlike the regional rate, which takes account of the property
                that people live in. Of course, the means whereby district
                councils raise their revenue is via the district rate, which is
                based on the same premise as the regional rate. Properties have
                a rateable valuation, and a penny-in-the-pound levy is set
                against that valuation. Are they going to change that as well?</p>

                and will consider the needs in each area. We will propose what
                we believe is right. Mr Close said that he had no doubt that if
                people were asked whether they wanted two more intensive care
                beds, they would be happy to put more money into the regional
                rate. If we said to the people on the Ormeau Road or Ravenhill
                Road &quot;We are not going to do any improvements on the water
                system here — it can flood next year and every year after
                that. We are going to keep your regional rate down to 2% each
                year&quot;, they would not be happy. So, we have to look at
                things maturely and reasonably — <i>[Interruption]. </i>I will
                have to get on with this, because I have other items to raise.
                The Alliance Party has talked at length about tax-raising and
                tax-varying powers, but is it serious?</p>

                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Alliance Party tell us that the 8%
                was wrong and that we should really have a 15% rise on the
                regional rate? I hear the Member for Lagan Valley (Mr Close)
                saying &quot;Yes&quot;. Perhaps he is even saying
                &quot;Yes&quot; to 20%.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCarthy is shaking his head. Yesterday he
                had a wish list the length of his arm of what he wanted the
                Executive to do. The reality — for Mr McCarthy’s benefit —
                is that there is only a certain amount that one can spend — <i>[Interruption]
                </i>If he wants the things on his wish list he will have to
                raise taxes. Perhaps the Alliance Party will learn to be mature
                about that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Alliance Party backed the December 1998
                deal, which proposed that there should be 10 Departments, thus
                supporting the spending of extra millions on administration in
                the Province.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is the Member suggesting that we should get
                rid of the Department for Regional Development or the Department
                for Social Development?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would be happy to return to six Departments
                and see the old Department of Environment split into two
                Departments, as the DUP proposed at the time. That would lead to
                better, more joined-up government. However, it was decided to
                spend more money then, and now there is less money to spend on
                housing, sewerage, roads, transport, and so on. I thank those
                who supported the new structures for doing that for the general
                public; it was very kind of them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to speak on some issues of interest to
                the Committee of the Centre. First, there is the failure to
                allocate money to victims. There was a request for £500,000 of
                extra money for victims — not a penny was allocated. That
                flies in the face of the Bloomfield Report, and it goes against
                what was set out in the Programme for Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">E-government is an area where the Government
                could make savings. There would have to be an initial
                investment, but it would lead to savings in the long term. It
                could even reduce wastage, and I am sure Mr Close would be
                interested in that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two bids were put in for e-government — one
                for £14·9 million and one for £0·9 million. Neither bid was
                met, so not a single shilling is going to be put in to
                e-government. There is the service modernisation fund of
                approximately £3 million. That fund will come under severe
                pressure. It will not go any way towards meeting the needs of
                e-government and it will be subject to bids from other
                Departments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government have stated their plans for
                e-government. They want 25% of key services to be capable of
                delivery by 2002, and 100% by 2005. That is not achievable if
                the money is not being put in. The bid, as detailed by the
                Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, was
                to increase the accessibility of Government service for all and
                improve the efficiency, effectiveness and economy of Government
                services. Furthermore, this bid was to enable social inclusion
                and to put the concept of sell Government once into place. The
                insufficient early funding of this work may place all the
                achievements at risk and leave Northern Ireland at a
                disadvantage. This is contrary to the ethos of the
                knowledge-based economy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The words spoken by the First Minister
                yesterday are hollow, especially as there is no funding in that
                area. He said</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;In addition, as set out in the final
                chapter, there are a number of cross-cutting initiatives that
                can improve the effectiveness of the Government. These include
                the increased use of electronics to create new and more
                effective means of providing services to and information for
                citizens and to handle data and information within the
                Government&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Legislation has been passed on equality
                issues. A £500,000 bid was made to implement much of the
                legislation that has been put before the Equality Commission,
                but it was not awarded.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All of this contrasts with those bids made in
                respect of departmental running costs which seemed to be met in
                full every time. No attempts were made to reduce those bids. For
                example, the economic policy unit bid for additional staff and
                received £479,000 — the full amount of the bid. The office of
                the legislative council sought additional staff and received its
                £106,000. The race equality branch bid for £125,000 for
                additional staff and received it. The list goes on. Government
                Departments received all the money they sought for additional
                staff in the departmental running costs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The same situation exists in the Department
                of Agriculture and Rural Development. The agriculture budget has
                risen by £25 million, however the farmers will not be any
                better off. It is a good budget for the Department of
                Agriculture and Rural Development, but it is not a good budget
                for agriculture. It is alarming that the budget for agriculture
                amounts to almost twice the profit of the industry. It costs
                twice as much to administer the Department of Agriculture and
                Rural Development in Northern Ireland as the farmers are making.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are a number of environmental issues
                that must be dealt with. I welcome the 12% increase in direct
                funding and the possibility of a further 2·3% increase as a
                result of retaining the receipts from the Environment and
                Heritage Service (EHS), planning and the Driver and Vehicle
                Licensing Northern Ireland (DVLNI) — and I thank the Minister
                for his co-operation in that — but there are matters of
                concern to the Environment Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For example, there was a bid made for £1·38
                million to lift the moratorium on the historic buildings grant.
                The Programme for Government states that the Executive will seek
                to bring in additional funding through a number of private
                initiatives as well as the lottery. However, as a result of the
                Department of the Environment not receiving the £1·38 million
                for the EHS, the Department is going to lose out on a large
                amount of lottery money. We have to have the money to pump-prime
                those projects so as to release the money that would be
                available from the lottery.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A further £461,000 is needed to maintain the
                Department’s own historic properties, and that has not been
                provided. We need to take a serious look at our built heritage,
                not just through words in a document but by awarding funding
                through the budget. In the resources element of the exchequer
                grant for the local authorities it is also a concern that our
                councils will lose out on around £556,000, while the councils
                in England, Scotland and Wales got their rewards in full. Those
                are matters that need to be addressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned that there has been a 0·1%
                drop in the money that will be spent on roads. I know that roads
                are not exactly the darling of a lot of people’s eyes and that
                cars are not deemed as being environmentally friendly, but we
                all use them. We all like to have good quality transport, drive
                down good quality roads, and get to where we are going in a
                reasonable time. Roads continue to deteriorate and it is
                important that we look after them. We need good quality roads
                and we must look at the budget and ensure that more money is
                invested in the Roads&nbsp;Service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the additional £20&nbsp;million
                that has been invested in the rail service. It has been
                crumbling for years, and if the money had not been invested,
                there would be no rail service in a few years’ time. In
                yesterday’s debate on the Programme for Government, the Office
                of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister stated that
                it wanted more buses of a higher quality and a younger fleet.
                Unfortunately that was not addressed in the budget, and the
                Department for Regional Development’s bid for additional money
                for buses was not met. It received £5·1&nbsp;million, which
                will replace 28&nbsp;buses a year, but 80&nbsp;buses need to be
                replaced over the next three years just to bring them up to a
                reasonable standard.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to Culture, Arts and Leisure,
                more money should have been invested in libraries. A high
                increase of 18·7% was allocated to the arts and only 5% was
                allocated to libraries, but libraries are more accessible to
                Joe&nbsp;Public. I also have concerns about the allocation to
                the Northern&nbsp;Ireland Events Company. Some years ago we saw
                quite a lot of money squandered in projects in the Positively
                Belfast debacle. The Northern Ireland Events Company should be
                more accountable for its finances. I would also like to ensure
                that the money is spread throughout the Province of
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland and is not spent solely on Belfast.</p>

                liom argóint a dhéanamh i bhfabhar na cothromaíochta do
                mhuintir Thír Eoghain agus Fhear Manach sa díospóireacht seo.
                Leis an fhírinne a rá, níl rudaí cothrom sa tsochaí seo,
                agus caithfidh an tAire — leoga, caithfidh an t-iomlán againn
                — seo a chur san áireamh agus sinn ag plé leibhéal an ráta
                réigiúnaigh, mar a thugtar air.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rather than argue for more money for roads,
                it would be much more productive if Mr&nbsp;Poots could persuade
                his party’s Minister to attend the Executive meetings where
                those arguments take place and where decisions are made. I
                oppose the idea that the regional or Six Counties rate should be
                applied uniformly throughout, ie, 8% domestic and 6·6%&nbsp;non
                domestic, because it does not take into account the fact that
                the playing field is very unequal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As an Assembly Member for West Tyrone, I am
                acutely aware of the historical legacy of discrimination,
                neglect and underinvestment west of the Bann — and I refer
                specifically to County&nbsp;Tyrone, County Fermanagh and County
                Derry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The allocation of resources is unequal, and
                the playing field is not level.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When arriving at the regional rate, the
                Assembly must legislate for those areas that have been
                completely denuded of essential hospital services. County Tyrone
                is a case in point. There is no maternity hospital, and
                expectant mothers have to travel unacceptably long distances on
                poor-quality roads. Lives are being lost, there is virtually no
                midwife cover at weekends, the out-of-hours surgery and GP cover
                is inadequate, and people from places like Eskra and Carrickmore
                are expected to travel to Enniskillen and Craigavon. That
                inequality needs to be legislated for when striking the regional
                rate. These are areas where the health service has been in
                steady decline for many years. It has been constantly eroded and
                virtually disassembled, brick by brick.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Similarly, the Assembly must legislate where
                there is no rail provision; where the road infrastructure is
                completely inadequate; where rural roads are not gritted unless
                there are 1,500 vehicles per day (not even school bus routes
                qualify); where official job-creation agencies have failed the
                people consistently; and where access to many public services
                which are taken for granted elsewhere has been denied to whole
                communities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not believe in this uniform approach to
                striking the regional rate. It is fundamentally wrong and should
                be reviewed, because it disadvantages rural communities. After
                all, the M1 stops at Dungannon, and the M2 stops beyond Antrim.
                People west of the Bann should not be subject to the same
                percentage increase.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to raise the issue with Nigel Dodds in
                the strongest possible terms. Earlier, he argued very
                unconvincingly about North/Southery, as he calls it. He said
                that North/South development constitutes a waste of public
                money. That is a completely irrational, party political approach
                that ignores the evidence that the creation of a single island
                economy and the avoidance of duplication is the way forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us go about the business of creating a
                single island economy and take account of the huge savings that
                such a rationalisation would bring about. We would not have two
                health systems, two education systems, two agriculture systems,
                two tourism systems, and two industrial development systems.
                Ireland is far too small a nation to have two systems of health,
                education, and so on.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unsurprisingly, Mr Dodds did not mention the
                Celtic Tiger very often. In my book, there are rather more
                compelling reasons for deepening and expanding the role of
                North/South implementation bodies. That is a far cry from Mr
                Dodds’s invitation to justify those bodies from a defensive
                standpoint.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today I spoke to a professional person from
                County Fermanagh who is very concerned about the level of the
                rates. He said that at the end of the day the only hope for
                Counties Tyrone, Fermanagh and Derry might lie with the
                Twenty-Six Counties. Then we might get our kitchen adaptations
                and house adaptations, our operations and our central heating;
                and our rural housing, which is unfit, might be addressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to touch briefly on other relevant
                issues. The Executive and the Assembly need to begin to define
                medium-term spending priorities so that we can use these to
                argue for increased spending targets for 2002-03 and 2003-04 and
                in future spending reviews. The present proposal to increase
                commercial rates by 6·6% is going to further cripple traders in
                town centres, who are already suffering stiff competition from
                out-of-town commercial centres. In Omagh, there has been a huge
                outcry from traders at the huge increases in their rates year
                after year without any hint of a reprieve or any demonstrable
                understanding of their plight.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On another point, where is this peace
                dividend that we have heard so much about? Where is this concept
                of making a difference for people living west of the Bann? Where
                and when is the balance to be addressed and redressed? Finally,
                we need to raise public awareness about the whole business of
                the regional rate being stuck. We need to demystify it and
                explain it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds referred to people receiving their
                rates bills and distinguishing between the regional and district
                elements. I do not think people do that. People receive their
                rates bills and wonder what public services they are getting in
                return. In rural areas there is a particular deficit of
                confidence in this regard. As other Members have outlined, the
                district councils have to bear the brunt of the blame from
                people who, quite understandably, do not fully understand the
                procedures and methodologies involved. I want to promote a
                programme of public awareness to aid transparency. Go raibh
                maith agat.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Weir:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to ground our examination of the
                Budget in reality. We can all come up with a wish-list of what
                we would like the money to be spent on. Indeed, if we were to
                add up the wish-list we would probably find that it amounted to
                twice the Budget that we are discussing today. We should not
                lapse into the green-tinted Utopia that the Member opposite
                seems to advocate — a 32-county Utopia that would cure all our
                ills. Suddenly there will be no ill people, and there will be
                money flowing in by the bucket load.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The reality is that we have got to look at
                how we can play a better role as part of the United Kingdom,
                which is an economy with a population of 58 million, and not at
                an all-island economy based on a population of 5 million. If the
                Member opposite understood anything about economics he would
                realise that what he has put forward is simply a recipe for
                Northern Ireland to go backwards into economic decline.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Member appreciate that the party
                opposite knows very little about economics but a great deal
                about racketeering?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Weir:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members opposite are obviously able to speak
                on their own levels of expertise. I presume that they have many
                skills and insights which some of us on this side of the House
                would not be party to.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I give a cautious welcome to the broad thrust
                of the Budget. That will come as a surprise to many Members,
                because I am not noted for saying positive things in the House.
                I will reassure those Members a little. Whatever positive
                remarks I make about the Budget, I will try to temper them with
                concerns, so that there will be no undue excitement in the
                Chamber today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is easy to welcome a Budget when we are in
                a position where, with the exception of the regional rate, or
                the Durkan tax, as it was called earlier, we are not actually
                raising any taxation. Instead, we are reallocating the largesse
                from the Northern Ireland block grant.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although there are arguments that Northern
                Ireland could have done better, we are able, following the
                comprehensive spending review, to have reasonable increases in
                spending across the board. That is to be welcomed. However, it
                is easy to deal with a situation where we are essentially
                looking at what additional bits of the cake can be brought into
                play. The real test of any Budget will be when we are faced with
                no net increases and are having to reallocate money on that
                basis. That may happen in future years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I add a further caveat. The Finance and
                Personnel Committee, albeit having a somewhat inadequate amount
                of time to do so, will be scrutinising this Budget very closely.
                It is clear from remarks made today that this is not a perfect
                Budget and that there are changes that need to be made. I advise
                the Minister that the Finance and Personnel Committee will be
                doing its job properly and scrutinising the Budget. We will not
                simply undertake a rubber-stamping exercise. We will be looking
                at where improvements can be made. He need not think that we are
                going to put a big tick at every aspect of the Budget.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having said that, I want to deal with a
                number of specific aspects of the Budget. First, a general
                welcome must be given to the spending increases in education and
                health. The key test of both of those — indeed, of any local
                administration — will be the extent to which people on the
                ground feel the benefit. In education, there is a massive
                backlog in the capital schools spending programme. The Health
                Service is in a shocking state. Last week a constituent of mine
                was injured in a house fire and a bed could not be found in the
                whole of the Eastern Health and Social Services Board area. That
                person had to be taken to Craigavon. That is an absolutely
                deplorable state of affairs. The key test of any increase in
                spending on education and health, indeed across the board, will
                be the extent to which it benefits people on the ground, rather
                than simply adding money to administration. Health and education
                must be watched closely.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also welcome additional spending within the
                Department of Environment on planning services, which has not
                been mentioned so far. Members will agree that there are
                problems surrounding planning issues. Many regional plans are
                out of date. The provision of more money to accelerate various
                development plans is to be welcomed. I was at a meeting last
                night in Donaghadee, where there have been a lot of
                complications with the Planning Service, but North Down is not
                an isolated example. It is a problem right across the country.
                The budget increase of 23·5% for the Planning Service is to be
                welcomed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that we are putting more
                money into the railways. I would not be as dismissive of that as
                another Member. During direct rule, and probably before,
                regional development tended to be the poor relation of the
                Northern Ireland Budget. Public transport has been the poor
                relation within regional development, and the railways have been
                the poor relation within public transport. As a result, the
                railways have been underfunded for years. The additional £20
                million that has been put forward is an attempt to rectify those
                problems. This is not a question of luxury spending on the
                railways; it is an absolute necessity. If we do not spend money
                on the railways now, as recommended by the AD Little report, we
                will not have the opportunity in five or 10 years’ time. If we
                do not spend it now, the railways in Northern Ireland will be
                completely untenable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some people refer to spending on railways as
                if it were some sort of glib project. A lot of that money has to
                go into track safety improvements. The events of the past month,
                both in England and now sadly in Austria, show us of the danger
                of not paying enough attention to rail safety and the threat to
                human life. This money being put into the railways is welcome.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If, however, we are going to consolidate the
                railways — which I think is the right course — it cannot be
                done by neglecting the rest of the railway line. We have got to
                see this as part of an overall project of real investment in the
                railways to ensure that Northern Ireland is not the poor
                relation of the British Isles while vast amounts of money go
                into transport both in Great Britain and the Republic of
                Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those things are to be welcomed. I also have
                some concerns, some of which have been raised already. I am
                concerned about the regional rate. I do not have the experience
                of local government as some of the other Members who have
                spoken, so perhaps I do not have the same personal axe to grind,
                but I remain to be convinced of the merit of the rise in the
                regional rate. It has to be made clear why that is taking place.
                I also share the concern that, at the moment, there is no
                transparency with the regional rate.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If money is to be raised through a regional
                rate or some such device, it must be made clear that the
                decision has been made by the central Administration at Stormont
                and that local councils are not directly responsible for it.
                Councils must not carry the can for decisions that are made by
                other people. We could call it the Stormont tax, or even the
                Durkan tax, but it must be clear that it comes from Stormont,
                rather than local government. Furthermore, I remain to be
                convinced that the rise in housing rents can be justified.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I express concern at the increase in
                departmental running costs. Many of us had concerns about
                whether 10&nbsp;Departments were appropriate for the
                administration of Northern Ireland. Setting that aside and
                looking at the budget figures, we can see that there have been
                large rises in departmental running costs for the majority of
                Departments. Not all of those rises are due to the transition to
                devolution. In each case, the rise in departmental running costs
                is above inflation. In most cases, running costs are increasing
                at a higher rate than the level of spending by that Department.
                There must be a close examination of that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have had a useful listening exercise,
                although the last Member to describe it thus did a great deal of
                talking for someone who was so interested in listening. We must
                ensure that we get the Budget right. This is a tremendous
                opportunity, and we must ensure that it is used to benefit the
                people of Northern Ireland, rather than just to put money into
                the Administration.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Byrne:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Budget is primarily about distributing
                the block grant allocation to Northern Ireland determined by the
                Chancellor, under the notional Barnett formula. Total spending
                is now about £6&nbsp;billion a year. The Barnett formula has
                been in existence for about 25&nbsp;years. Northern Ireland gets
                a share based on its population.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The allocation does not, however, reflect
                relative regional GDP. That would give us more, on a pro rata
                basis. Northern Ireland is almost doubly dependent on public
                sector spending as a proportion of GDP. Over 60% of our economic
                output is dependent on the public sector; the rest of the United
                Kingdom is much less dependent on the public sector. Our economy
                is largely driven — or perhaps constrained — by the public
                sector. The challenge for the Assembly is to decide how the new
                administration can give new impetus and thrust to the local
                economy, so as to generate more economic activity, create more
                jobs and produce higher value added output from the private
                sector?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We can learn from our neighbours in the
                Republic. That is why I give a particular welcome to the
                economic aspects of the North/South institutions and to the
                meaningful co-operation between the northern Administration and
                the Administration in the Republic. Why do some parties in the
                Assembly feel so aggrieved and threatened about spending on
                these North/South institutions? The promotion and development of
                economic activity will be to our benefit.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regardless of the political differences in
                our attitudes to &quot;North/Southery&quot;, does the Member
                accept that there is a great deal of expense associated with the
                North/South Ministerial Council meetings? Written Answer No 169
                revealed that the cost to one Department of ferrying officials
                back and forth was £16,000. Does he not realise that that is a
                waste of resources? I am sure he could come up with ideas on how
                that money could be better spent in his constituency. I could
                certainly come up with a whole lot on how it could be better
                spent in mine.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Byrne:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for his comments, but my
                attitude is not to prejudge outcomes. Let us give new
                institutions and mechanisms a chance to operate, then apply some
                qualitative assessment to their performance. Let us learn from
                the Republic in a collaborative and productive way. The five
                Executive programme funds, in my opinion, offer the greatest
                potential for stimulating and promoting what I call public
                policy redirection, for resource adjustment to kick-start the
                private enterprise sector in Northern Ireland and to enhance
                general economic activity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The drawing up of public service agreements
                in Departments is a welcome development proposal, which offers a
                new opportunity for us to contribute at three levels to
                improving the performance of this small regional economy. There
                is a great need for a stronger interaction and engagement
                between politicians in this Assembly, civil servant policy
                formulators, and the other social partner stakeholders —
                Northern Ireland commerce and industry and the voluntary and
                community sector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome resource budgeting if it leads to
                better Government departmental performance, where targets based
                on predetermined objectives are set. It is absolutely essential
                that output performance is continually measured, so that
                corrective action can be taken in the remit of public
                accountability and ultimately deliberated upon in this House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The thematic approach in the Budget and in
                the Programme for Government is welcome. Creating a more
                competitive regional economy is necessary. The primary themes
                are based on equality implementation and New TSN. To those
                people and sections of our community who need help, this must
                deliver an encouragement to develop themselves and their
                communities. Community development has been very successful over
                the last ten years, particularly in rural Northern Ireland. How
                can this administration stimulate and enhance more widespread
                urban community-based developments, striking a sensible balance
                between the social and economic parameter objectives? That is
                now the challenge. The European Union initiatives and money have
                greatly enabled this process. I regard the five programme funds
                as a similar public policy mechanism to enable better economic
                and public performance. I make particular reference to the
                service modernisation fund, which I believe can lead to a better
                performance. The new directions fund can enable new directions
                to be created and can add to the private sector
                enterprise-driven approach which needs to be developed in
                Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many people have talked about the
                infrastructure capital fund. We all know about the neglect of
                investment in roads, rail, water and sewerage over many years.
                Some Members asked today why nobody had blown the whistle early
                on. I ask that question again. Surely we should have been
                informed ten years ago about the under-investment in these funds
                and projects. We have now reached the stage where massive
                investment is needed for this region to perform better
                economically. That is the reason I welcome the discussion about
                using private finance. We should have no ideological hang-ups
                about using private finance for public sector investment.
                However, private finance should be used in such a way that we do
                not add handicap to the public purse. It must be used in a
                meaningful way that does not add extra costs or burdens.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the early 1990s the Irish Government
                secured £8 billion from the 1994-99 European structural funds.
                We received only £1 million. The economy in the Republic has
                performed extremely well since. The reality is that in the same
                period we in Northern Ireland got £3·5 billion per year from
                the British Exchequer — £17·5 billion in total. We can
                reasonably ask what are we doing wrong that we do not have a
                better local regional economic performance.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to highlight three issues, the first

                that there is going to be a substantial amount of investment in
                the railways. It seems to be specifically directed at the safety
                aspects, and we would like to see more money being put into that
                category. That poses some questions. What would happen if the
                Westlink does not go ahead? Where would that money go? Would it
                go directly into the railways or into other road schemes?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the budget for the Department
                for Regional Development, we are all aware of the needs.
                Important roads schemes have been put on the long finger. For
                example, the Comber bypass has been on the list to be
                constructed for the past 30 years. Today all we have is the
                land, which has been recently acquired, but we have not got a
                start date. Perhaps, at long last, work could commence in the
                current financial year. There must be some criteria to deal with
                long-delayed projects such as this. We have waited too long for
                a road scheme the need for which was recognised 30 years ago,
                and the problem has been exacerbated during this time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second issue is cultural and linguistic
                diversity. I want to deal specifically with the promotion of
                Irish- medium education. The Programme for Government document
                refers to viability criteria. What does that mean? Where does
                Ulster Scots appear in this? It seems to be solely about
                Irish-medium education. Are there viability criteria for Ulster
                Scots in the education system? Can the Government ensure that
                Ulster-Scots will be allocated funding equal to that set aside
                for Irish-speaking schools and the integrated education system?
                In the interests of fair play we want to see this matter
                resolved. In the programme there is no fair play for the
                Ulster-Scots language, nor for our culture or history.</p>

                Chair)</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third issue concerns the health sector.
                We must all be aware of the needs of the community. I want to
                target a particular group — those who suffer from Alzheimer’s
                disease or dementia. I find it disappointing that in the
                proposed Budget there has not been further consideration given
                to the needs of an ever increasing elderly population. In the
                next few years there will be an increasing demand upon the
                Health Department. As people age the possibility of dementia
                increases as well.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is estimated that Alzheimer’s disease
                will affect more and more people, yet in the Budget of £2,284
                million it has been given no specific consideration. We should
                be looking at ring-fencing money for the care of those with
                dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. If that money were to be set
                aside it would mean a full range of care and support services in
                each of the trust areas. One of the concerns is that in our
                contact with the boards we have found that only one that has set
                aside money for the problem. The Western Board has set aside
                just over £2 million.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">None of the other boards has got as far as
                that yet. That is very worrying. It shows very clearly that the
                Health Department itself does not seem to have acknowledged the
                problem. They have had a programme with recommendations sitting
                on the table in their Department for five years, and nothing has
                been done. The health boards themselves, with the exception of
                the Western Board, have not even got to the stage of putting
                this on their list of things to do. That speaks volumes the lack
                of commitment from the boards and from the Health Department</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Are the health boards and the Health
                Department hoping that the dementia problem will go away? That
                certainly will not happen. There is a responsibility on the
                health boards and the Health Department to provide dementia
                services. They need to be provided now, and the strategy needs
                to be put together at once.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At present there are 16,000 people in
                Northern Ireland who suffer from dementia. In the Eastern Health
                and Social Services Board area — my own area — there are
                7,200, by far the largest number in any board area, and yet they
                have no programme whatsoever at this time. That is despicable.
                We depend upon volunteers. Everyone recognises the good work
                that volunteers do. There are some 40,000 volunteers who look
                after those 16,000 people who suffer from dementia and Alzheimer’s
                disease.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If a little was spent now, a great deal could
                be saved later on. Early diagnosis costs would be one way of
                doing this. At the moment, an early diagnosis costs £330. With
                a distinct possibility of having 1,500 new cases each year, the
                total cost could be £0·5 million. However, if we do something
                now, we will have fewer concerns later on in relation to health
                and the cost of looking after those suffering from dementia.
                There are also drugs available. Money should be spent to combat
                Alzheimer’s disease. There is also a host of volunteers who
                are quite willing and able to give aid to those suffering.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly and the Department have the
                power to ring-fence moneys. I would like to see that happen, as
                that is the only way to ensure that dementia sufferers will be
                cared for. We have to recognise the growing demand on resources.
                We all recognise that. This is not just a wish list. These
                things are very important. An increasing number of people will
                need help, yet there is no security of funding. This must be
                addressed in this year’s Budget.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many people already feel isolated and
                socially excluded. It is not just the sufferers but also those
                who provide the care. Purchasing plans should recognise the need
                for the development and availability of a full range of care and
                support services in each community unit and trust area. That is
                what we are seeking. Service providers should plan to ensure
                that appropriate support and care is based on an assessment and
                maintains the quality of life and independent living of people
                with dementia and their carers. We have to ring-fence the money
                and ensure that it is there in this financial year.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members might like to have a progress report
                on how we are doing. There are 15 Members still to speak, as
                well as the Minister, who, by convention, has 10&nbsp;minutes
                for each hour of debate. I am sure that he will manage to get
                his words in in that time — about 60 minutes. Mr Leslie will
                wind up. I am not putting any limit on your time, but I am
                making a little suggestion that it might be wise to try to think
                of something absolutely new to say, because there is a tendency
                towards repetition.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCarthy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much has been said on the Budget proposals
                already, and you will be glad to hear, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I
                do not believe in repetitiveness. I wish only to comment
                briefly. I wish to underline my total and absolute opposition to
                the proposed 8% increase in the regional rate. My Colleague
                Seamus Close has adequately spelled out our total opposition. I
                welcome the speech this morning of Nigel Dodds, who was also in
                opposition.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This increase is a breach of two important
                taxation principles. First, the people who spend the money —
                namely, the Government — should be made accountable for
                expenditure. However, when people receive their rates bills,
                they do not make a distinction between the regional and council
                rates — they see them as a lump sum. Councillors recognise
                this, and there are many of us in the Chamber. It is councillors
                who will be blamed for the rates increase, rather than
                Mr&nbsp;Durkan or the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second principle is that taxation should
                be progressive — the more you earn and the more you spend, the
                more tax you should pay. However, this regional rate is a form
                of regressive taxation. Everyone needs to live somewhere and
                most people end up paying rates, directly or indirectly. Rates
                payment often hurts the elderly and single parents, who do not
                have a regular income. Has this proposal for an 8% increase been
                equality proofed?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister told us yesterday that the
                new Administration is responsive to the community it serves and
                that it is in tune with the people who elected it. That was a
                very important statement. When the Executive discovers that many
                representatives, including councillors, are opposed to this 8%
                increase in the regional rate, will it act accordingly and take
                alternative measures?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Alliance Party is not opposed to
                increased spending by the Assembly; indeed, the opposite
                applies. The people of Northern Ireland want properly resourced
                public services and they are willing to pay for them. My
                Colleague Mr Close suggested means by which this can be done —
                namely, through a reduction in waste and greater efficiency.
                However, the Alliance Party is opposed to the use of the
                regional rate as a back-door mechanism for finding extra money.
                The Assembly should be upfront; it should also be arguing for
                tax-varying powers for Northern Ireland. This morning I was glad
                to hear that Mr McGrady is coming round to our way of thinking.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Member give way?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCarthy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No. The Member did not have many constructive
                comments to make, so I will not waste time now.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a good idea to set up a common fund
                under the common authority of the Executive to examine such
                cross- cutting issues as e-government and children. While these
                funds are relatively small this year, there will be a more
                significant sum over the next couple of years. The Alliance
                Party welcomes some of the specific increases to be made in
                spending for individual Departments. Nevertheless, I am
                concerned that the requests from the Department of Culture, Arts
                and Leisure were not met and that libraries, which are an
                important facet of the community, are not being properly funded.
                The lack of funding for our rural road system is another
                problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Health is the biggest concern of the people
                of Northern Ireland. We welcome the 5% spending increase on
                paper, but we are suffering from insufficient provision of major
                equipment, a shortage of intensive care beds, and so on. This
                problem has been best illustrated by the case of a burns victim
                from Bangor, who had to be taken to Craigavon Area Hospital
                before a bed could be found for him. This type of incident is a
                total disgrace, which cannot be tolerated, and while it
                continues, every Member should accept some responsibility for
                the problem and take the necessary action to secure sufficient
                funding so that this never happens again to any member of our
                community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Budget tells us that this extra money
                will enable the Department of Health to respond effectively to
                the needs of an ageing population and to the rising costs of
                modern medicine. It also claims that there is provision for the
                continuation of such essential commitments as addressing winter
                pressures, waiting lists and the deficiencies of the ambulance
                fleet.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is certainly a bold claim; we will be
                able to judge it as time goes on. Let us hope that the ambition
                will be achieved. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that Northern
                Ireland will still remain well below the European average for
                health spending as a portion of GDP. Many more resources are
                needed. At the same time we must ensure that the money is spent
                wisely and efficiently. A review of health administration is
                inevitable, and the sooner this is done, the better.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We in the Alliance Party are anxious that
                more resources are devoted to preventative medicine, cancer
                research, care in the community and public health. Such
                investments can help to avoid much greater costs later.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Budget leaves a lot to be discussed and
                debated. I am most unhappy with its contents and look forward to
                a much improved Budget when the Committees have carried out
                their duties. Finally, I will not support a Budget which is
                funded in part by an 8% increase in the regional rate; I will
                not support a Budget which is funded in part by inflation and by
                a 2% increase in the Housing Executive rents.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most of my questions are to do with
                transparency and accountability. Though I have digested these
                figures during the year, I find it very difficult to follow them
                through from the Estimates into this draft Budget. The Minster
                has mentioned the ability that we have now to draw into the
                block funds some moneys to which we previously had no access. I
                want him to address that issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Where did the £63&nbsp;million go? I asked
                this during the last discussion of the Budget for the New Deal,
                and I note that, no matter how hard I try, I cannot find it now.
                This is a substantial sum. It may be worth noting for the record
                that £63&nbsp;million is more than what some Departments have
                to spend. I want to draw attention to the fact that, though we
                in the Higher and Further Education, Training and Employment
                Committee have inquired about its whereabouts, we still cannot
                find that money. A huge sum of money was set aside. We were not
                allowed to spend it, and we were told it was ring- fenced. As it
                cannot now be found, there may be a question mark over whether
                it was ring-fenced. It would be good to have an answer to that
                before today is out.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would also like to ask the Minister how he
                managed to get such a huge increase in the Executive programme
                funds. The sum of £16&nbsp;million has been set aside this
                year, but will that rise to £200&nbsp;million? While we have
                been talking about increases of 5% or 8%, year on year, in the
                devolved expenditure, here is an increase of over 1,000%. How
                have we managed to rise from £16&nbsp;million to
                £200&nbsp;million? Are these the funds that we were formerly
                forbidden to touch, or is this some type of new money?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would also like to ask the Minister who
                will be held accountable for that funding. Which Committee will
                scrutinise the Executive programme funds? I must emphasise again
                that £200&nbsp;million is more than the entire budget allocated
                to some Departments. Perhaps a special committee should be set
                up to query this Budget. I am not for one minute suggesting that
                I am not happy to see it; on the contrary, I am delighted to see
                it. However, if we are to exercise a scrutinising function to
                hold people accountable for spending — as the Assembly
                requires us to — I would like to know how we intend to do that
                with such a large Budget.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also concerned about the lack of
                transparency. Perhaps the Minister would have a word with the
                headmaster and the deputy headmaster. I draw Members’
                attention to page&nbsp;26 of the Budget, which refers to the
                Office of the First&nbsp;Minister and the
                Deputy&nbsp;First&nbsp;Minister — it gives us three lines.</p>

                that was set up as innovative and was given such huge
                responsibility should deliver a Budget like this. It tells us
                about the Secretariat’s functions, but not about how much
                money is to be assigned to each constituent part.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We talked about the Programme for Government
                yesterday, and justice is one of its themes. The programme says
                there will be a strategic policy on victims, but this is not
                mentioned once in the draft Budget. No mention either is made of
                funding or of any allocation to service the unit. This issue has
                been raised on the Floor before. I am asked over and over again
                who is responsible. I thank the Minister for telling us that
                responsibility is split between the Northern Ireland Office and
                the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Where does this fall under the Budget and how
                much money is assigned, for instance, for equality and the Civic
                Forum? Members opposed to the Civic Forum have often asked how
                much it costs. The Civic Forum is up and running now, and it
                would do us no harm whatsoever for those questions to be
                answered. We know how much it costs, and that should have been
                included in the Budget.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I know that this is asking an enormous
                question of the Minister, but why has there been such a huge
                increase in departmental running costs? For example, the running
                costs for the Department of Higher and Further Education,
                Training and Employment have increased by 16%. I would like to
                think that we could send out a message that year-on-year
                departmental costs should not rise by more than 4% to 5%, and
                occasionally 6% to 7%, depending on the introduction of new
                programmes. I sit on the Higher Education Committee, and I am
                unaware of any new programmes. In a recent announcement the
                Minister of Higher Education said that he intended to
                consolidate his Department by bringing in the Training and
                Employment Agency. That should cut running costs rather than
                increase them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I think the Minister misunderstood a previous
                question about groups going to the wall as a result of
                transitional European funding. I am delighted to hear the plea
                that we continue our excellent work in the community and
                voluntary sector in Northern Ireland. The Programme for
                Government states that it will attempt to build on that work,
                given the divisions we have had to face over the years in our
                communities, and it applauds that sector for interfacing across
                the sectarian divide.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister has probably received letters
                from these groups and will know that they are making many people
                redundant, either because they do not have transitional funding
                to tide them over or because of sustainability. This is a
                crisis, an emergency, and the Minister is as aware as anyone
                else of what is facing the groups on the ground.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In order to see a way through this, I would
                ask what plans we should now be making to draw down funding such
                as lottery money or other outside funds. The Programme for
                Government speaks loudly about developing a social economy. I am
                glad to see the words &quot;social economy&quot;, but that idea
                should be built into the Budget, and I do not see how that can
                be done if funding and resources are unavailable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The women’s sector of the lottery funds has
                been spending many millions of pounds on work that has many
                indicators of success, but the National Lottery Charities Board
                has said that it is now struggling, either because the lottery
                is going down or because not enough people are buying lottery
                tickets. On average, £20&nbsp;million a year was given out to
                that sector in Northern Ireland and funding has now decreased.
                It is no longer able to facilitate the large number of women’s
                and community groups in particular. They have written to us and
                pleaded for someone to look at this seriously. Perhaps we should
                look at drawing down National Lottery funding into Northern
                Ireland — we were told that we might be able to do that after
                devolution — and then take responsibility for how much comes
                here. I know that decisions about what happens to the money here
                are made in London because I once sat on the National Lottery
                Charities Board when questions were asked about what would
                happen and how much more flexible it would be upon devolution.
                The Minister has not been assigned that yet, but, given that we
                do not seem to be able to mainstream funds, the good work is
                going to the wall. We are not able to sustain it, so we may have
                to consider how we use outside funds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How flexible will this Budget be in terms of
                policy changes? We are currently undergoing a student review,
                and we may not have the answers to that in time to incorporate
                them into this Budget. No doubt they will be held off until next
                year’s. I hope not. However, other issues will arise.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members may be aware that a High Court judge
                ruled the other day in the case of a 12-year-old boy who had
                previously absconded from residential care and had been given a
                place at Lisnevin juvenile justice centre — where he should
                not have been for a minor disorder charge. He was there because
                no secure beds could be found for him. The lack of secure beds
                resulted in this child ending up in a juvenile centre. There is
                now a secure bed, but unfortunately, in spite of the High Court
                judge’s ruling that he be given 24-hour supervision, they are
                unable to find him. He disappeared 45 minutes after entering the
                residential-care home. That shows the crisis we are in. The
                Programme for Government and the Budget say that some additional
                beds will be made available. It is important for us to note that
                number is only 12 — 12 when we need 115. We have many young
                boys and girls absconding all over the country.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad that we have got 10 extra
                psychiatric beds because the mental health problems of our young
                people are excessive. They have not been provided with the
                necessary services, particularly in the light of the troubles.
                We are facing a crisis unless we incorporate some policy changes
                into the Budget. I would put down a marker that we stop waiving
                budgets, that particular issue relates to the Department of
                Health, Social Services and Public Safety.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased to see that some Ministers have
                said what they were not successful in bidding for. The Minister
                of Further and Higher Education, Training and Employment said he
                was unsuccessful in obtaining any money for foundation degrees.
                However, I see in the Programme for Government that that is one
                matter that we will be taking care of. Therefore, if we are
                talking about cohesiveness, let us have that between the
                Programme for Government and the Budget. There is no point
                saying that we hope to do things and then find from the Budget
                that we cannot.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, can we have a little bit more
                clarification in the final plan of what was in the Chancellor’s
                initiative in the past, what was non-devolved, and what is now
                in the Executive programme funds. We can understand the figures.
                What we cannot understand is that when we voted last year on the
                Estimates, a figure was available to us yet in this draft there
                is no longer a figure for the year 2000-01. I want to see those
                figures because I want to see what is available for this
                country, the total that was available last year under the
                Chancellor’s initiatives, and what is available out of the
                Executive programme funds for next year. I want to see how much
                new money we have and whether we will continue in a crisis
                management situation.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Savage:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister of Finance and
                Personnel’s well-presented Budget for 2001-02, especially its
                laudable aims of transparency and greater flexibility in
                departmental accounting. However, I have reservations about the
                real impact of the Budget on farm incomes. In determining the
                expenditure limit for the Department of Agriculture and Rural
                Development, the new formula of resource accounting and
                budgeting has replaced the old cash accounting system. The
                rationale for this is set out for all Departments in the
                explanatory memorandum attached to the Executive’s public
                expenditure plan for Budget for 2001-02. The danger of this
                system, which is consumption- driven rather than cash-driven, is
                that Departments with the culture of saving as opposed to
                spending will be the losers, while Departments with a
                big-spender mentality will gain — in short, waste will be
                rewarded.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Agriculture, as in the
                United Kingdom, sees itself as a regulator rather than as a
                support mechanism for farmers, which is what happens in France,
                for instance. This is borne out by the more selective targeting
                of animal disease compensation — what the Minister calls
                &quot;enabling planned provision to be aligned more accurately
                with anticipated requirements&quot;. This targeting is
                reminiscent of the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s targeting of
                additional money for pensioners, which has caused such a furore
                nationally with its implications of means testing. This may be
                prudent financial management, but it looks miserly in the
                context of the real crisis in farm incomes and hardship in the
                farming sector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister must avoid the temptation, which
                seems to afflict all Finance Ministers, of becoming the Scrooge
                of Government. The year-on-year percentage drop in the budget
                for rural development is disappointing, especially as this is an
                important supporting mechanism in enhancing farm incomes. I
                question the calculations because the expenditure remains almost
                unchanged at £8·3 million, and this implies that inflation is
                only 0·4%. Even with the United Kingdom’s enviably low rate
                of inflation, and the Irish rate of almost 7%, our figures
                cannot be as low as that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore the agriculture sector needs our
                protection, and so does the fishing industry. It seems that
                everything under the remit of the Minister of Agriculture is
                under serious threat. For example, the average net profit of a
                trawler has fallen from over £29,000 to just under £3,000.
                This needs immediate action, as it represents a reduction in
                profitability of over 90%. With so many of the areas under the
                Minister of Agriculture’s control in a state of crisis, I
                often wonder if the Minister becomes depressed. I am sure that
                the active solutions the Ulster Unionist Party can offer her
                must be of great comfort to her, and I hope that the Budget will
                go a long way to alleviate the present problems in the
                agriculture industry.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dallat:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker, I noted your opening
                remarks and will confine myself to one issue — one that has
                been mentioned by Ms McWilliams. I ask for the allocation of
                greater resources to address the needs of adult education,
                lifelong learning and community-based projects operating in this
                field.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A close examination of the allocation of
                resources to the Department of Higher and Further Education,
                Training and Employment reveals that the percentage increase
                does not allow the Minister to address these issues as I am sure
                he would wish to. A written answer from the Minister of
                Education this week made it clear that the Department will be
                unable to meet its targets for improving literacy and numeracy
                in secondary schools. The problem does not begin in secondary
                schools but starts almost from the moment a child is born. For
                more than 250,000 people between the ages of 16 and 64 the
                problem will continue for the rest of their lives unless more
                money is made available to address this injustice. This is
                happening in a society which, it is claimed, has the best
                education system in the world. We need to pause, stand back and
                remind ourselves that it is not just our city centres that need
                to be lit up as we emerge from the dark days of the past. The
                lives of our people must also be rekindled. The Programme for
                Government, which was discussed yesterday, promises to do that,
                but there must be adequate resources to address the needs of
                those who have been marginalised in the past, including those
                who have lost out on education and training.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last week I saw a chink of light when I
                visited a cross-community project on the Ligoniel&nbsp;Road in
                north Belfast. Here the local community, including parents,
                teachers and children, work as a team to ensure that no child
                leaves school without being able to read and write. The project
                depends on public funding which will run out in a few weeks,
                unless resources can be found to keep it going. What will that
                mean for the children? Little Jimmy has moved house three times
                since September. He has serious learning difficulties, but his
                workbooks suggest that, slowly but surely, he is building a
                vocabulary of words that will form the foundation for his
                future. He is helped by a classroom assistant from the
                community, who has benefited from the same community education
                project. Sitting beside him, I remember little Rebecca, another
                child who now has an air of confidence about her as she receives
                personal help from another classroom assistant. I intended to
                spend no more than half an hour there, but after two hours I was
                still excited by what I was learning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the heart of this socially deprived area
                there is hope for the future. Each child is important and is
                aided by dedicated teachers and community activists. The neat
                classroom and tidy playground tell me that this community is
                holding its head up for the first time. I wish that as many
                Members as possible could visit that project and see the power
                of community education and community groups. For those who are
                interested, the school in question is St Vincent de&nbsp;Paul on
                the Ligoniel&nbsp;Road. I have no doubt that there are many
                other equally deserving projects. There are many fine
                community-based projects across Northern Ireland, but more must
                be done if social inclusion is to have its proper meaning. If
                the Assembly is to make a significant impact on people who have
                been disadvantaged during decades of neglect, we must continue
                to target social need and find the resources to continue the
                work of regeneration.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yesterday I spoke of the regeneration of
                towns and villages, but today I refer specifically to the
                regeneration of people who have existed in the twilight world of
                neglect, presided over by an uncaring Government and the
                political instability of the last thirty years. As I said
                goodbye to the school principal and the organisers of that
                community project in north Belfast, I promised that I would use
                my influence to ensure that little Jimmy and Rebecca, and all
                the other children, would continue to have all the support that
                they need. We must do everything possible to ensure that no more
                children join the 251,000 who have gone through the education
                system with either undetected or ignored learning difficulties.
                The Assembly has a responsibility to ensure that continuing
                education and lifelong learning is a reality and that all those
                involved in delivering that service have the resources to
                continue their work to redress the educational defects of the
                past.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned that the budget for the
                Department of Further and Higher Education, Training and
                Employment will not be adequate to address the concerns I have
                spoken about. I petition our officials, the Executive and the
                Minister to revisit this issue, for it is of fundamental
                importance to the success of the Good Friday Agreement and of
                the Assembly.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The events of the last two days have shown
                the Assembly at its best and at its worst. Yesterday’s debate
                earned us no brownie points whatsoever. The spectacle of a large
                number of Members standing up and rattling through prepared
                notes for five minutes in a desperate attempt to fit in as many
                subjects as possible can certainly not be construed as a debate.
                Today we have at least seen some healthy scrutiny of the Budget
                and some exchanges between Members as they tried to tease out
                very important points. Mr Close has starred in his normal role:
                exciting, enlightening, and blighting us all — and making some
                important points. I probably did not agree with a word he said,
                but I felt that his points were well put.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In future, if we are to combine a debate on
                the Programme for Government with the crucial issue of the
                Budget, we must avoid squeezing everything into two days. No
                matter what our views of the Executive and its plans, this is
                without doubt the most important matter we shall deal with as an
                Assembly. It is important that we call the Minister of Finance
                and Personnel to account, probing, questioning and making life
                difficult for him. He has a chauffeur-driven car and a very
                healthy salary, and he should earn them. Therefore the more
                probing and questioning we can direct at him, the better.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Turning to the Budget itself, I should like
                to welcome the 27% increase in the budget allocated to the
                Department of the Environment, though I suspect it will not be
                enough. There is absolutely no doubt that the work of the
                Environment and Heritage Service and the Planning Service, two
                major constituents of that Department, has suffered enormously
                as a result of the last 30 years’ underinvestment. I tabled a
                question to the Minister, Mr Foster, on the subject of the
                designation of areas of special scientific interest (ASSIs) —
                the highest accolade which can be awarded to an area of natural
                habitat in the Province.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The legislation which brought in the ASSI
                designation was the Nature Conservation and Amenity Lands
                (Northern Ireland) Order 1985. I was in the old Assembly when we
                ploughed through that legislation line by line, and it took many
                months to go through. Fifteen years ago we expected that, once
                the Order was in force, all the ASSIs in Northern Ireland would
                be designated within five or 10 years. I was horrified to learn
                that only 175 areas have been designated, with at least another
                80 or 90 in the pipeline. It could be another 20 years before
                all these areas are designated. That is simply unacceptable.
                Indeed, under direct rule the Department gave an assurance that
                the complete designation process would be complete by 2000. We
                have only about six weeks of that year left, and it is obvious
                that it is simply not going to happen.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome any injection of funding which will
                increase the amount of work done by the designation team. It is
                a sad reality that, without designation, an area of important
                wildlife habitat can be destroyed. The owner or occupier can
                destroy it or denude it of its scientific value, and nothing can
                be done unless a planning application is required. If a farmer
                decided to chop down some ancient woodland in the Minister’s
                Londonderry constituency in the absence of a tree preservation
                order or a requirement for planning application, he could do so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We saw a very good example recently — not
                in my constituency but close to it in Killyleagh — when a
                property developer decided to fell five acres of very important
                woodland, since he felt that it would be awkward having it there
                when he put in his planning application to build houses on the
                land. One morning he moved in with a bulldozer at the crack of
                dawn and destroyed it. There was nothing anyone could do, for
                the area had not been designated. These areas cannot just be
                designated ASSIs in their own right; they can also be designated
                special areas of conservation (SAC) and special protection areas
                (SPA) under European legislation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The way the Environment and Heritage Service
                has been carrying out this work, it has not been possible to
                designate SACs and SPAs until the area has been designated ASSI
                — holding up the whole implementation of the European
                directives in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this Province, we are fortunate to have
                some incredibly important areas for wildlife — such as
                Strangford Lough, Lough Foyle, the Antrim plateau, and most of
                County Fermanagh. The equivalent areas of habitat in other parts
                of the United Kingdom have long since been destroyed. In
                Northern Ireland we are fortunate to still possess many
                important areas and it is vital that they are designated and
                protected. That is not happening because of the lack of funding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also deeply concerned about the lack of
                progress that has been made in the designation of areas of
                outstanding natural beauty. Why has Strangford Lough not been
                redesignated under the terms of the Nature Conservation and
                Amenity Lands (Northern Ireland) Order 1985? Why have there been
                so many delays in protecting some of our very high quality areas
                of natural beauty? Again it has been lack of funding. Only
                £300,000 per annum has been set aside for the management of
                areas of high quality landscapes such as the Mournes, the Antrim
                plateau and the Sperrins. In any other part of the United
                Kingdom the budgeting for these areas would have been much
                higher. Of course, most of them would be national parks and have
                a very large amount of money set aside for their management.
                Northern Ireland is like Cinderella in that we have some of the
                best landscapes in the United Kingdom, with the smallest amount
                of money to protect them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My favourite area is north Londonderry. The
                representatives for East Londonderry — the Limavady and
                Dungiven area — have an incredibly attractive area around
                Benevenagh. It is one of the great unsung treasures of this
                Province, and many people do not know that it exists. Areas like
                that require much more protection than they are receiving.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned that in the Budget and the
                Programme for Government the crucial words &quot;global
                warming&quot; do not feature. Anyone who has been watching the
                media over the last few weeks will see that there is now almost
                conclusive proof that, as a result of the emission of greenhouse
                gases into the atmosphere, we in this Province and people
                throughout the world are facing radical changes to our climate.
                The Executive should have given some thought to the implications
                of that for Northern Ireland. I accept that most of our
                coastline is not so low-lying that we will suffer inundation or
                coastal erosion to the same extent as east Anglia, Yorkshire or
                Lincolnshire. Any responsible Executive must be looking at the
                implications of such a major change on our agriculture, lowland
                flooding and drainage systems, all of which should be
                considered. This issue has not been addressed and there is no
                excuse. All these points where arising whilst the Executive was
                forming its Programme for Government and devising the Budget.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the 23·5% increase in the budget
                for the Planning Service. Many Members will be aware of the
                enormous pressure that the Planning Service is under at the
                moment. They are being deluged by a huge increase in the number
                and complexity of planning applications and I fear that the
                Planning Service is going to break under the pressure. Gone are
                the days when they simply had to deal with an application for a
                couple of dozen houses. We now have applications for major
                developments in the countryside, running to 200 to 300
                dwellings. If the Planning Service decides to turn those down,
                often with public and local authority support, they then have to
                fight public inquiries at great expense, both in terms of money
                and manpower. At the moment Northern Ireland has had a huge
                increase in inquiries. The budget for the Planning Service has
                been insufficient to meet those demands.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive have missed an opportunity. The
                Planning Service requires a radical increase in funding and a
                radical upgrading of its status. We expect them to implement and
                oversee the regional development strategy and develop area plans
                for a large proportion of the country, yet we still have it
                within a Department, simply as a planning service. Is that
                sufficient to meet the demands being placed upon it and should
                we consider upgrading the status within the Department, perhaps
                making it a Department in its own right?</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we do not increase the status of the
                Planning Service, it will simply buckle under the pressure from
                the big developers. Those Members representing coastal areas
                will know of a huge increase in the number of applications for
                apartments and the amounts of money that are being paid for
                sites. I do not believe that the Planning Service has the status
                or the resources to fight the battle that is going to stretch
                from Donaghadee to Kilkeel and Rostrevor, and all along the
                north coast. There is a major battle ahead for the Planning
                Service, and we must give it the power and the resources that it
                needs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to make one point about area plans. A
                great swath of Northern Ireland is covered by area plans that
                are out of date. So far the Planning Service has not had the
                resources to start the ball rolling to update them. Given the
                present difficult circumstances, and considering the 23%
                increase in funding, I suggest that it should engage consultants
                to do most of the donkey work involved in preparing the plans.
                There simply is not sufficient qualified planning manpower in
                Northern Ireland to undertake this work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because of the pressures for development we
                must very quickly reach the stage where every part of the
                Province is covered by an up-to-date area plan.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My other interest is regional development. I
                congratulate the Minister Mr Gregory Campbell, on securing such
                a healthy increase in his budget. It shows that there is no need
                to be sitting round the Cabinet table with Mrs Brown and Mr
                McGuinness to put in a strong bid for increased funds and to
                achieve what is needed for one’s Department. I congratulate
                both Mr Morrow and Mr Campbell on being so successful. I am
                particularly pleased that Mr Campbell has achieved a £100
                million package for the railways. For once, the tide has turned
                in favour of public transport in this Province.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We now have a three-year programme
                attempting, once again, to make up for the gross
                under-expenditure on the Province’s infrastructure. We can now
                turn the tide in favour of the railways. I asked the Minister at
                a recent meeting what would happen after the end of the three
                years. There is no guarantee that the work will continue when
                that funding is over. Obviously, I am hoping that, having spent
                £102 million on the upgrading of the tracks and rolling stock,
                we will find ourselves in a position where we cannot turn back.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But what has happened to the Prescott money?
                The Deputy Prime Minister, John Prescott, announced a very large
                package of about £2 billion, which I understood was to lead to
                an upgrading of, and a massive investment in, public transport
                throughout the United Kingdom. I distinctly remember the words
                &quot;the United Kingdom&quot; being used. However, at a recent
                meeting with the Minister for Regional Development and his
                officials it was far from clear whether any of it was going to
                come to Northern Ireland. Under the Barnett formula at least one
                fortieth, or 2·5%, of the amount would normally be allocated to
                Northern Ireland. That would allow massive investment in public
                transport in the Province. However, no one can tell me what has
                happened to that money. Is it coming to us? Is it coming to us
                as additional money? Perhaps it is not coming at all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Finance and Personnel, Mr
                Durkan, must find out exactly what is happening. If it has not
                yet been earmarked for Northern Ireland he should ensure that it
                comes our way. If it comes as additional money it will do a
                tremendous amount to upgrade the tracks, the bus service and
                public transport in general.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another crucial issue facing the Assembly —
                and one which will dog us for many years to come, if we survive
                that long — is the infrastructural deficit in respect of both
                the Water Service and the Roads Service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have to thank the Chairperson of the
                Regional Development Committee for the following figures. He
                always has these figures at the tips of his fingers. That Water
                Service requires £3 billion in the next 30 years, and the Roads
                Service requires £2 billion over the next 10 years. We do not
                have tax-varying powers — a euphemism for tax-raising powers.
                Without the ability to raise revenue except through the regional
                rate — and our rate base is too small to raise this large
                amount of money — there is absolutely no way that the
                Assembly, under the present budget restrictions, can ever raise
                that type of money. We have to accept that it cannot happen.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore I have to agree with Mr Byrne that
                we must explore every other possibility of raising this money.
                Such a massive amount is needed that we must bring in the
                private sector, not to take over our infrastructure but to
                assist us in its financing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are currently many difficulties. What
                private operator will want to come in and run our railways? They
                would have no return for their capital, and if there were a
                return it would be so small that they would be far safer
                investing their money in the stock exchange, gilts or a deposit
                account.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive and the Programme for
                Government must find ways of getting this money to upgrade
                services — roads, water, and railways — without inflicting
                the cost on the taxpayers. If we can crack that one, we are
                worth every penny. It is going to be difficult, but that is
                something that we are going to have to concentrate on over the
                next few months.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have not been parochial yet, but I have to
                be just once. I am beginning to think that this is not the
                Northern Ireland Assembly but the west Tyrone Assembly. I am
                getting tired of the gallant six from West Tyrone standing up
                time after time and saying &quot;What about poor downtrodden
                Strabane and Omagh? We never seem to get anything.&quot; You
                would think that once you crossed the boundary into west Tyrone
                you would find people walking around barefoot and
                hungry-looking, with thatched cottages, and pulling their
                groceries home in a donkey cart.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Leslie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Member agree that as West Tyrone was
                made the eighteenth constituency in the last boundary redraw,
                there must be a lot of people living there and it cannot be such
                a bad place after all?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any time I visit West Tyrone it seems a
                perfectly average part of Northern Ireland which has
                underspending in some areas but perhaps no more so than
                Londonderry, North Antrim, South Down or anywhere else. But week
                after week we hear them, and I noticed in last night’s
                television coverage of the Assembly that yet again there was the
                trio from West Tyrone saying the same things. What is the
                definition of an Assembly Member for West Tyrone? He is someone
                who when he sees light at the end of the tunnel goes out and
                orders more tunnel. That is exactly the impression I am getting.
                Their cup is always half empty — that is a totally irrelevant
                aside.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But if they are allowed to be parochial, as
                they always are, maybe I can mention one issue that must be
                tackled. It is relevant to my constituency and elsewhere. Many
                small towns in this Province are being strangled because of
                traffic congestion, and all that is required is a relatively
                modest amount of expenditure to take traffic away from them in
                order to let the towns return to their former glory. A classic
                example in my constituency — and, I maintain, one of the worst

                thousands of cars en route to Newcastle, Kilkeel or other parts

                a congested town in the evening but it is causing the
                strangulation of the tourist trade which has been designated as
                the only possible economic growth area in our constituency? The
                consequences are very serious. On the one hand the Government
                are pumping money into centres such as Newcastle to promote the
                tourist industry, and on the other hand they are cutting it off
                by not supplying the access.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This will ensure that there are two
                statements in next week’s ‘Down Recorder’ to the effect
                that the problem in Ballynahinch had been raised in the Northern
                Ireland Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree entirely with Mr ONeill. We are
                totally united on this issue. Not only is Ballynahinch being
                strangled but Ballynahinch is different from other parts of
                Northern Ireland in that you have no option but to go through
                the town if you want to travel from the Greater Belfast area to
                the tourist area of south Down.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unless one has a detailed map showing the
                rural routes, an alternative road is almost impossible. Not only
                is Ballynahinch badly congested, but the tourist industry of the
                Province is adversely affected. Tourists, quite rightly, are put
                off by having to sit in a queue of traffic — possibly for half
                an hour going through Ballynahinch and half an hour coming back.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That problem could be relieved by an
                expenditure of between £5 million and £7 million spread over
                several financial years. Dr Birnie tried to defend the
                expenditure on the cross-border bodies, the
                &quot;North/Southery&quot; as it is called. A fraction of what
                is being spent on the North/South institutions could solve
                Ballynhinch’s by-pass problem immediately, build a new harbour
                in Kilkeel and retain Downe Hospital. Money is being wasted on
                the shenanigans of running up and down to Dublin.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Mr Paisley Jnr stated, the £16,000 spent
                on one set of Ministers travelling to a North/South body would
                employ a classroom assistant or a trainee nurse in south Down.
                That is a lot of money.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that the Finance and
                Personnel Minister allocates sufficient money to the Department
                for Regional Development. Some of that should be ring-fenced to
                clear those bottlenecks. That is an environmental issue. It is
                not healthy for the residents of places such as Comber and
                Ballynahinch to be sitting in towns that have a lot of car
                exhaust fumes caused by large numbers of cars waiting to pass
                through the town. The quality of life for people in those areas
                is extremely poor because of congestion in the towns.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ventured into the area of parochialism even
                though I was concerned that I might be criticised. It is one of
                the most pressing regional development issues in my
                constituency.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes, I have, but I need my second article for
                the ‘Mourne Observer’.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are enormous funding difficulties in
                the Water Service, and I am concerned that the new filtration
                plant for the Silent Valley will not be finished until 2004.
                That means that the sheep grazing ban in the inner Mournes will
                last for at least another three seasons, which will cause
                enormous difficulties to the farming community in south Down.
                The Minister should ensure that the funding for that project be
                speeded up to enable its quick conclusion.</p>

                I will be speaking on agriculture, but I will keep as far away
                from sheep as possible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Mr Wells said, why do people try to focus
                on everything in the Budget? It is almost a natural progression
                from the ideas that are to be found in council — if you leave
                anything out you are seen as not supporting it. People then feel
                that they have to justify their support for almost every issue.
                I am also glad that Mr Wells thinks that there might be future
                Budgets for the Assembly to discuss.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Overall, it is a good Budget. When Members
                sit on different Committees they have different interests, and
                they try to focus on what most deserves extra funding. In
                particular, the Assembly is unsure where the funding that went
                to the Executive will be designated. With regard to the block
                grant, our gross domestic product is much lower than that of the
                South or parts of Europe. Therefore there is the difficulty of
                having a block grant which is too low.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given that we are a population growing out of
                conflict, the least we could have expected was the British
                Government to bear their own responsibility by enhancing the
                Budget for some years to make up for the underfunding over the
                past 80 years. All Departments cross-cut with agriculture and
                they all have a part to play in developing rural areas. There
                has been a question mark over the Executive obtaining funding,
                and over Departments boxing off moneys for their own projects.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Agriculture and Rural
                Development made bids of about £10&nbsp;million for visioning
                and £9 million for administration that was not paid for in
                other years. Do they still expect to receive that money, or will
                it come from other budgets that we are keen to support or push
                for in other years, such as supporting farming developments that
                would give money directly to farmers? That is one of my
                difficulties with this Budget. There is nothing in it for
                farming development and the possibility of receiving money in
                future years will be just as difficult to achieve.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The allocation to agriculture is low because
                the British Government policy is anti-farmer. The Ministry of
                Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has stated that, in the past,
                European moneys to farmers have damaged the rural landscape —
                but I think they are referring to the London area. We need a
                higher budget in Northern&nbsp;Ireland to keep our environment
                intact and to allow people to remain in the countryside for the
                best reasons. We should work at this on an all-Ireland basis and
                not just as the afterthought that the North has always been in
                terms of British Government policy — and will continue to be
                as long as we are in that situation. Their failure to draw down
                European funding because they would have to provide match
                funding is directly related to that policy. Millions of pounds
                could have been used in our budget to deal with the things we
                have been asking for.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Agriculture and Rural
                Development’s administration budget has to be questioned. A
                sizeable amount of money is spent each year on disease
                compensation, but can one farmer receive as much as
                £1&nbsp;million from that budget? We will have to investigate
                why large sums of money can go to individuals and we have to
                ensure that the best use is made of the budget. Rather than
                being in a position where a budget of £6&nbsp;million to
                £8&nbsp;million is having to be used each year to keep
                something there which should be changed or eradicated, the money
                should be used more efficiently for something else.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Planning has been mentioned quite widely.
                Mr&nbsp;Wells mentioned ASSIs, ESAs and AONBs and the fact that
                they have not been always designated, especially in Fermanagh
                which would gain from such designation. People were against
                designation because planning regulations have been used to stop
                them building in the countryside. It has not had a detrimental
                effect, but it has turned people against designating these areas
                for the wider benefit of everyone. No money has been directed
                towards carrying out surveys to help people gain an
                understanding of the issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome some of the elements of the Budget
                that will create a more efficient food industry. We are a food
                producing country, and we should be going in that direction. If
                we compare the Government’s commitment to the needs of
                agriculture in the Budget compared with what has being given in
                the South this week, we will see that there is very little or no
                commitment towards farming and agriculture. We have to question
                the future commitment to this industry, which is still very
                important to many parts of the Six Counties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also welcome that aspect of the Budget
                which seems to be willing to spend money on placing IT
                facilities on farms. That is very welcome, in that it would
                encourage people to develop new skills and perhaps set up a new
                business or innovate an existing one that may, in turn,
                alleviate the pressure of low incomes among the farming
                population.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although reputed to have a high cost, the
                North/South implementation bodies have a lot to offer, but the
                difficulty is that there is underresourcing in this area. There
                are tremendous benefits to be had, however, and anyone who does
                not look at the island of Ireland in an all-island context is
                looking in the wrong direction. In any sort of industry where,
                for example, there was a factory, you would control it as one
                unit; you would not have separate parts working to the detriment
                of each other. That is definitely the direction in which we need
                to be going.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The DUP has a narrow-mindedness in relation
                to that as well as a narrow and inward focus, which has always
                been costly. How much has this cost us, not just during the last
                30 years but in the last 80 years, in tourism and agritourism?
                We have estimated that approximately 20,000 jobs could be
                created in tourism over the next few years, although that figure
                is just benchmarked against the number of tourism jobs that have
                been created in the Twenty-Six Counties and is not a real figure
                at all. Considering the cost of the situation at Drumcree each
                year, I do not see that there is any kind of future in tourism.
                The present budget for tourism is, indeed, probably being
                wasted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with most of what was said about
                rates. There is a difficulty in that money is needed from the
                regional rate, but people in various businesses are being taxed
                three times over. They have to pay the regional rate; they are
                taxed on their business, and they are taxed on their home. That
                is unfair, for not everybody is able to afford it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Housing Executive budget is one that
                affects my county in particular. We have a very high percentage
                of housing deprivation, although it is being dealt with. The
                drop in the budget will have a massive effect on housing
                deprivation, and one has to question how much longer the Housing
                Executive will be able to deal with these issues. It will have a
                long-term effect on the rural areas. People there do not have
                access to housing under the old regulations and will have to buy
                new houses, which they are, perhaps, unable to afford.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some people have mentioned to me the fact
                that NIE charges for the likes of meter readings and ground
                rent; they should not be doing this. That is not an efficient
                way of running a Government business or one that is part-public.
                No other business would be allowed to charge money to provide a
                service and then charge again. NIE should look at that, for they
                may be taking money under false pretences. The Water Service
                operates in a similar way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fermanagh has a longer network of roads than
                any other county in Ireland, and it has one of the greatest
                expanses of small undermaintained roads. We have a small
                maintenance budget of £150,000 to £200,000, yet very little
                funding is to be allocated to larger projects for the
                foreseeable future. The amount of tax we pay is illustrated by
                individuals such as Sean Quinn, who has paid more money in tax
                on his lorries over the years than is channelled into even a
                quarter of our Budget in any year. The Department for Regional
                Development must examine this issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been a push for the provision of
                rail transport, and it is good that this has been budgeted for.
                However, this will not alleviate transport difficulties in rural
                areas, such as Fermanagh, where there are no railways. The aim
                of public transport is to carry large numbers to their centres
                of work, but not many people live in rural areas, and, in any
                case, a very small percentage of the population actually works
                in Belfast city centre. Rural areas are affected by the high
                cost of fuel which results in an increase in the cost of
                anything which is transported in or out of the area. Those who
                live in rural areas have no choice but to use a car. This issue
                must be taken into account, even if we have to stand up
                constantly and highlight it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the issue of expenditure on cross-border
                bodies, there is no reason for the Minister for Regional
                Development not telling his counterpart in the Twenty-Six
                Counties that people there use roads in parts of the North as
                much as, or more than, we use their roads. There is no reason
                for not co-financing some of the main corridors into areas in
                the North, and particularly Fermanagh. Their Government seem to
                have a lot of money to spend and, in looking to the future of
                all-Ireland unification, they should consider using their budget
                to fund the island’s infrastructure on an all-Ireland basis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Collaboration on local road provision is
                taking place between councils like Fermanagh and Monaghan. I see
                no reason for not developing this on a larger scale or for not
                at least requesting the co-financing of budgets for major road
                developments. There is an excellent road in the Twenty-Six
                Counties, which runs the length of Aghalane, yet the route which
                runs on to Enniskillen has been described by local councillors
                as a goat track. We do not have budgetary provision to remedy
                this, or, at any rate, the budget has not been given to us by
                the Department. We have applied for funding to upgrade that road
                within the next 15 years. That is the situation with roads in
                Fermanagh.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Underinvestment and economic underperformance
                in the past have been due largely to total dependence on the
                British Government’s subvention for the security industry
                here. This supported the notion that it was not necessary to
                have an effective economy, operating on its own merits. That has
                contributed to the difficulties which we now face. Recent
                eye-openers, which have affected local ports, particularly
                Harland and Wolff, will perhaps illustrate how businesses must
                stand on their own feet.</p>

                the security subvention budget and there was no need for
                businesses to operate efficiently. There are those who hark back
                to the old situation where remilitarisation was necessary as a

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also want to mention hospitals,
                particularly in the context of the regions. The Regional
                Development and Health Departments have to take into account all
                that has been said about the underspending of this budget. It is
                probably the most important part of government, and you can not
                put it on the long finger. If you need money for this winter —
                if you need to provide services to people who are ill — you
                cannot put it off until next year or for five years; something
                has to be done about it now. There is not enough money available
                again this year, although that probably comes down to the fact
                that all moneys are coming from the block grant. I know that
                hospital provision is under review, so we must demand immediate
                access to services this winter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Services in local hospitals have been cut
                back again, and we demand access to equal services; access is
                the key priority. When Belfast City Hospital stopped providing
                maternity services, people in Belfast complained about having to
                travel two miles to get to the nearest centre which provided
                those services, but there are women in Fermanagh who travel
                60&nbsp;miles to access the nearest maternity services. If a
                person who lives in the most remote part of my area were to
                suffer a heart attack he would have to travel 60&nbsp;miles to
                get to a hospital — well outside the golden hour — and this
                would increase the threat to his life. It is a question of
                underfunding and the loss of skilled staff. We lost many staff
                last winter due to budget cuts, and we will have to try to
                replace them this year at great cost.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fermanagh is suffering while this review is
                going on, and we will have to deal with the situation
                immediately. In view of the tight budget within which we have
                had to operate this year, where will the money come from to
                provide some of the services we have asked for in our local
                areas. Under policy appraisal and fair treatment (PAFT) or
                targeting social need (TSN) we expect no less parity in the
                budget as any other area in this Assembly. Go raibh maith agat.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Neeson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker, I can assure you that I
                will not take as long to make my points as the last two Members.
                We must bear in mind that this is a take-note debate. However, I
                am concerned that the process of scrutinising the Budget and the
                Programme for Government leaves a great deal to be desired.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not think that we have done the people
                of Northern Ireland any great service this year, because of the
                process in which we have been engaged. I believe, however, that
                we must recognise the problems that the Executive and the
                Assembly have faced this year. It is clear that we have
                inherited major problems created and developed by our
                predecessors over the last 20 or 30&nbsp;years. There has been a
                gross underfunding of the Health Service and education, and in
                recent weeks we have seen the difficulties experienced by the
                Water Service and the flooding that my constituents and those in
                other parts of Northern Ireland have experienced on a regular
                basis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then there is the whole question of the gross
                underfunding of the railways. My party and myself have been
                dealing with this issue for two or three years. We recognised
                the serious problems being created with regard to the rail
                network in Northern Ireland: trains were breaking down; there
                had been a number of serious near misses; and great lengths of
                railway track were being neglected. In my area the sea wall has
                fallen in between Carrickfergus and Whitehead. These things were
                allowed to happen and have now created problems for the Assembly
                and the Executive. We must approach this issue in as positive a
                manner as possible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reference has been made to the moneys set
                aside by the Deputy Prime Minister, John Prescott, to deal with
                the problems of railways in GB. I understand that at present
                there is no substantial amount of money coming to Northern
                Ireland from that particular kitty. I hope that I will be proved
                wrong in this case. However, if this is accurate the Assembly
                has a responsibility to approach the Government to ensure that
                the necessary funding is made available to provide a modern rail
                network in Northern Ireland. This is what is happening in the
                other parts of the United Kingdom.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If that is the case — and the Member may
                well be right — it is incumbent on the Minister of Finance and
                Personnel to tell us what he has done, or is doing, to redress
                that matter. Under the Barnett formula, are we not entitled to
                at least 2·5% of that funding package? His Department should be
                asking why we do not get our slice of that cake.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Neeson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was coming to the question of the Barnett
                Formula. Like many Members, I am seriously concerned as to
                whether Northern Ireland gets its fair share. It is not only
                incumbent upon the Minister to ensure that Northern Ireland gets
                its fair share; it is incumbent upon the Assembly as a whole.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is another issue which lacks clarity in
                the Budget. I and others have been campaigning to ensure that
                the natural gas pipeline is extended to the north-west — the
                Minister’s own constituency. With regard to energy, there are
                major opportunities for us to develop an island energy
                infrastructure. This question of natural gas is important, as is
                the issue of the North/South gas pipeline. There is a need for
                some clarification.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am strongly in favour of targeting social
                need. However, I am unhappy that new TSN still adheres to the
                Robson index, although perhaps not as rigidly as the previous
                TSN did. My own area of Carrickfergus — which has the
                fifth-highest level of unemployment in Northern Ireland — is
                regarded, under the Robson index, as having zero deprivation. In
                developing policy, it is important to recognise the inadequacies
                of using such a formula.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the major principles that the Alliance
                Party adheres to is the principle of sharing over separation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to think that trying to bring
                about integration will be at the very core of all the policies
                of the Assembly — not talking about two Committees, or a
                number of Committees, but bringing about an integrated single
                community in Northern Ireland. That must form the basis of any
                policy expounded by the Government.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How do we overcome ghettoisation? Does the
                Member agree that that is our greatest difficulty with
                integration, particularly in urban areas where communities are
                polarised?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Neeson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is one way of getting away from it. To
                all intents and purposes, Mr Byrne’s party sides with one
                section of the community, and people on the other side of the
                House side largely with the other. We want to create an
                integrated society, and the sooner we get away from tribal
                politics in Northern Ireland, the sooner we can create that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">European funding is another important part of
                the overall Budget for Northern Ireland, and there is a need to
                finalise the programmes for peace and reconciliation and the
                structural funds, so that we can benefit fully from European
                funding in the transitional period from having Objective&nbsp;1
                status.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Earlier in the debate you warned against
                repetition, Mr Deputy Speaker, so I will simply say this:
                regional rate, regional rate, regional rate. Or perhaps even
                Executive rate, because the Executive has taken the decision to
                increase the regional rate by 8%. It is cheap — and it is rich
                — of Sinn Féin Members to complain about the major increase
                in the regional rate. The Sinn&nbsp;Féin Members are part of
                the Executive. Where is the collective responsibility? Surely
                that must be taken on board. The Assembly needs to look at that
                seriously. On the point about introducing this rate through the
                back door, why do Members not sit down with us and talk about
                tax-varying powers for the Northern Ireland Assembly, on the
                same lines as the tax-raising powers for the Scottish
                Parliament. People have to realise that if we are going to have
                a Government in Northern Ireland, we must be up front. Rather
                than bringing moneys in through the back door, let us be up
                front with those people.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is the Member aware that the Scottish
                Parliament has made no use of its tax-raising powers? As far as
                I know, it has no plans to do so. It has discovered that there
                might not be quite the same enthusiasm for it in action as there
                was before the referendum. When does the Member expect the
                Scottish Parliament to make use of these powers?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Neeson:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recognise that the Scottish Parliament has
                not so far used those powers, but the option is there. We do not
                have that option. I hasten to add that perhaps Scotland benefits
                more from the Barnett formula than does Northern Ireland. There
                is a cushion there which we do not have.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the beginning I said that I was very
                concerned about the process this year. It is to be hoped that
                next year we will be able to exercise the real powers of
                scrutiny that the Assembly has. I have been out of the country
                for the last few days, but I hear that Mr John Taylor is
                suggesting that we collect our P45s at the end of January. We
                all know just how committed Mr Taylor is to the Assembly. I
                fervently suggest that next year when we are dealing with the
                Budget and with the Programme for Government we have a process
                that will be effective and efficient and will provide real
                scrutiny of those proposals.</p>

                scrutiny role, millions of pounds could have been saved and
                spent on delivering services rather than being wasted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like me, the Member serves on the Public
                Accounts Committee where in the past few months there has been a
                clear demonstration of the inaccuracies, the wastage and the
                inefficiency that we have in Northern Ireland. We want to
                correct that, and we can do that through proper scrutiny.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Beggs:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I fear that the Member has not been listening
                to my comments. Nowhere in my contribution did I indicate any
                desire to privatise the Water Service. I do not know why he is
                jumping to that conclusion; perhaps it is something he is
                thinking about.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I too am a member of the Public Accounts
                Committee. I acknowledge that several members of that Committee,
                many of them in the Chamber, do valuable work, and I hope that I
                do likewise.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, are we really going to make a
                budget, based upon a hypothetical saving which might occur,
                given the fact that we do not even know what areas we are going
                to investigate over the next year? Have no doubt about it: there
                will be savings. However, should we commit expenditure now, when
                those savings have not occurred? I favour prudence in public
                expenditure. I favour pressing for those savings and — when
                they arrive — putting them to the best use. At that point, we
                should redistribute the savings to the most needy areas of our
                various Departments. It is imprudent to spend money you do not
                have.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I said that I would raise an area where I
                thought there was potential for saving in this Budget. I wonder
                how many Members, in their Committees, have carefully
                scrutinised the central administration costs of each Government
                Department proposed by the current Executive? The Department of
                Agriculture is spending £98·1 million on departmental running
                costs (a 6·4% increase); the Department of Culture, Arts and
                Leisure is spending £12·8 million (a 10·4% increase); the
                Department of Education is spending £18·7 million (an 11·9%
                increase); the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment is
                spending £38·1 million (a 4·8% increase); the Department of
                the Environment is spending £35·8 million (a 13% increase);
                the Department of Finance and Personnel is spending £97·3
                million (an increase of 5·1%); the Department of Health, Social
                Services and Public Safety is spending £32·7 million (an
                increase of 5·2%).</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It makes me wonder what central
                administration does in the Department of Health, given the
                number of boards, trusts and taskforces we have. What are they
                all doing? What are they doing at the centre?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Higher and Further
                Education, Training and Employment is spending £31·4 million
                on departmental running costs (a 16% increase). That is a very
                excessive increase in departmental running costs. The Department
                for Regional Development has departmental expenditure limits
                increasing by 10·2%. It will be spending £137 million on
                departmental running costs, an increase of 3·5 %. The
                Department for Social Development is having an increase of
                15·3% in central administration and miscellaneous services
                costs. It will be spending £156&nbsp;million — an increase of
                9·1% in departmental running costs. I would like each of those
                Ministers to come to this Assembly.</p>

                I have too. We should all raise them in the Committees. How many

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member seems keen to flaunt that fact. We
                can sit back, do nothing and accept it, or, within our groups or
                collectively within the Assembly, we can apply pressure to the
                Executive and the Minister of Finance and Personnel to achieve
                savings, so that we have money to spend on free transport for
                the elderly. Let us achieve some savings so that we can spend
                money where we want to spend it. Interestingly, while sitting
                through this debate I received a written answer to an oral point
                I made on 24&nbsp;October. The reply is from the
                First&nbsp;Minister and the Deputy&nbsp;First&nbsp;Minister. It
                is rather interesting, and I will read a little from it:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We share your concerns about the need
                to avoid excessive administration. We were elected to this
                Assembly to produce more accountable and more efficient
                Government, not to create unnecessary bureaucracy.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Budget figures we have been discussing do
                not tally with the comments in this letter. We need to ensure
                that savings are made in central Departments. We must not create
                fiefdoms for our Ministers with lots of civil servants to answer
                all their wishes. It is important that Ministers go back to
                their Departments and scrutinise them carefully to achieve
                savings. We have new technology; e-commerce is being flaunted
                and we have e-government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When a private sector company introduces new
                technology, it is to save money and improve its business
                performance. By introducing new technology, we have made savings
                in this Budget. How will that benefit our electorate? We are all
                answerable for this, and the Executive and every Minister are
                accountable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will now comment on something raised by
                another Member — criticism of some of the changes in the peace
                funds. Anyone interested in the expenditure of Peace I cannot
                fail to be confused and bewildered by the number of funding
                bodies and agencies that are distributing money. Administration
                is duplicated, and as we come to Peace II it is important that
                this is examined so that we eliminate wasteful administration in
                intermediate funding bodies and get clarity on which
                organisations to approach for money.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Member agree with me that many of
                these bodies are made up of volunteers who do not receive any
                remuneration? Surely they have been one of the success stories
                in Northern Ireland, constituting a partnership that did not
                hitherto exist.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Beggs:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps what I said was not clear. I am not
                criticising the voluntary funding bodies. I am criticising the
                number of intermediate bodies with full-time staff who determine
                where the funding goes. Why are there so many such funding
                bodies, with expensive administration costs? These costs mean
                that less funding goes to the voluntary sector and the community
                groups to which the Member refers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regarding the earlier contest for the biggest
                traffic jam, I will not be inviting the Minister to examine the
                bottlenecks in east Antrim. He is, however, welcome to come and
                visit the A2, but not in the middle of the day. Let him visit
                the main Carrickfergus to Belfast road during peak morning
                congestion, or perhaps come to the Mallusk junction of the M2,
                which ends up like a car park. I invite the Minister to come and
                view that morning congestion.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Constructing more roads cannot reduce
                congestion. An increase of vehicles in Northern&nbsp;Ireland has
                been predicted, and there has already been considerable growth.
                Continued construction of new roads will create our equivalent
                of the M25 car park. While public transport and public
                infrastructure will play an important role in the reduction of
                congestion, it would be difficult for anyone to promise to
                remove it. The public transport system, including railways, will
                be important for minimising congestion. I would not like Members
                simply to walk away from the Budget and do nothing. I would like
                Members to focus and to apply pressure both on Ministers and on
                the departmental Committees they serve. Let us make savings and
                have money redirected to the areas where we want to spend it.</p>

                in the rates for its big houses. What is its solution? Its
                solution is an increase in income tax. Let the Alliance Party go
                to the electorate and say that it will increase income tax, as

                milestone in our politics; we have produced our first home-grown
                Budget in 30 years. We should be proud of that achievement. Each
                party should be proud of that achievement, even the
                &quot;semi-detached&quot; DUP, for it has unofficially, perhaps
                indirectly, contributed to this. I pay tribute to its Ministers
                for the work they have done, though I would love to see them in
                the Executive. Mr Wells says that they have done very well

                Party, the SDLP and Sinn Féin — fighting for their

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My constituency, North Belfast, has the worst
                housing problem in Northern Ireland. We have 880 applicants on
                the urgent housing list and 1600 on the main list. The Housing
                Executive produced a strategy to deal with that problem, which
                it also saw as the worst in Northern&nbsp;Ireland, but the
                budget allocated — and I have checked this in detail with the
                Housing Executive — does not provide the additional marginal
                money necessary to implement the strategy. One must invest in
                land, for one cannot build houses without it. The Housing
                Executive needs that money to kick-start the vesting of land and
                initiate the strategy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The money is not there, and I blame the
                Minister for Social Development, Mr&nbsp;Maurice&nbsp;Morrow,
                for not going to the Northern Ireland Executive and carefully
                pointing out the necessity of having that money to kick-start
                the Housing Executive’s strategy for dealing with the worst
                housing problem in Northern Ireland. Not going into the
                Executive to fight his corner for the additional money was a
                dereliction of duty. We are talking about £15 million over
                three years — £4·1 million this year. If the Housing
                Executive does not get that £4·1 million this year, the whole
                programme will be set back for another year. Next year we shall
                need more money, for the price of land will go up, putting the
                entire programme back. We are increasing rather than diminishing
                the problem in North Belfast.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to see the Minister for Social
                Development going to the Executive Committee to plead his case
                and get the extra money for the Housing Executive. If he does
                not do that, then I send a message in this Chamber today on
                behalf of the homeless people and those suffering poor housing
                conditions in North Belfast. Let Mr Durkan look at the Budget
                again and try to provide money to kick-start this vital strategy
                to ameliorate the terrible conditions in North Belfast — an
                area that has suffered more than any other part of Belfast from
                civil strife and distress. I ask the Minister to apply his mind
                and those of his officials to sorting out the situation caused
                by the dereliction of duty on the part of the Minister for
                Social Development, Mr&nbsp;Maurice&nbsp;Morrow.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The 10% increase in the overall regional
                development budget is a great achievement and represents a
                recognition by the Executive of the necessity of improving our
                infrastructure, which has been starved of investment over the
                past 30 years. We must improve our infrastructure if we are to
                develop a competitive economy. I welcome the 10·2% funding
                increase allocated to the Department.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I give credit to the Minister for Regional
                Development for his work with regard to that and also to the
                Regional Development Committee that I chair. It also lobbied
                hard to get that increase in funding. It is a measure of the
                importance that the Executive places on regional development
                that it has agreed to a 10% uplift.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The increase in funding for Northern Ireland
                Railways of £19·6 million next year is long overdue. We could
                not have avoided allocating that amount of money. Not to do so
                would have created an almost disastrous situation of paralysis
                for Northern Ireland Railways and the almost total closure of
                our railways. A number of Members have said that railways do not
                affect their constituencies, and I understand that. However,
                railways are an important aspect of the creation of a public
                transportation policy which will dynamically change our attitude
                towards transportation in the twenty-first century. We need to
                create a modern system in which public transport is in the lead,
                and the investment in railways is very important from that point
                of view.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells referred to the £3 billion we
                require for the Water Service. I want to reiterate, as Chairman
                of the Regional Development Committee, that that money is
                necessary to bring our ageing water system up to European
                standards. We cannot neglect that. The real question, which has
                been posed by many Members, is this: where do we get that
                finance? We must be innovative in raising finance to carry out
                that type of development. It is unavoidable, and we must invest
                that money. If we do not, it will be disastrous for public
                health and, equally, for industrial and economic development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I emphasise the point that we need £2
                billion for the Roads Service to bring the road network up to a
                proper standard. That point has been well made, and I am not
                going to repeat it. The amount of money allocated to the Roads
                Service, an additional £3·8&nbsp;million for roads structural
                maintenance, is inadequate. I have to say this openly and
                publicly. It represents a 9·5%&nbsp;increase when we needed
                100%. I do not say this lightly. The reality is that if we do
                not invest money in roads structural maintenance our roads will
                simply decline further and further. That will affect not so much
                our urban areas, motorways and major roads but our minor roads,
                particularly in the rural areas. We must take account of that.
                We cannot deprive our rural population of proper access to road
                transportation. Many of those living in the countryside are
                entirely dependent on the motor car as a means of
                transportation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been an allocation in this Budget
                to current concessionary fares. We know that the Minister and,
                indeed, the previous Minister, Mr P Robinson, proposed a new
                scheme to allow free travel for older people. This might
                interest you, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All Members, irrespective of age, will back
                such a scheme. However, given the absence of an allocation in
                the Budget, it will be impossible to implement it, unless the
                district councils — the alternative that has been proposed —
                are prepared to carry the burden. The money needed for the new
                scheme could be about £7 million, but it would provide a much
                needed service for older people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate the Minister of Finance and
                Personnel on the innovative idea of creating the Executive
                Programme Funds. As Chairman of the Regional Development
                Committee, I am particularly pleased to note that there is an
                indicative figure of £146 million in the Executive Programme
                Fund for infrastructure. I hope that those indicative figures
                will materialise over the next three years. The Minister should
                make clear how those funds will be accessed and what criteria
                will be used to satisfy the fundholder — the Northern Ireland
                Executive — that the applicant Department is entitled to
                receive those funds. It is an interesting and valuable new way
                of distributing funding across the gamut of departmental
                responsibilities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate the Minister on the Budget. It
                will be recognised as definitive and will bring a greater
                maturity to our politics.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr S Wilson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unlike my Colleague Mr Wells, I do not have
                to worry about making statements for local papers or comments
                for local constituents. I was not even going to speak in the
                debate, but I was provoked into doing so by some other speakers.
                We need to clear up some of the issues that were raised.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a pity that some of those who got so
                incensed about my party’s position are not still here. I
                congratulate Mr Close on staying through this marathon session,
                although he was one of the people who provoked me. Mr Cobain
                also provoked me, but he never stays any longer than his own
                speech, because he does not like it when the spotlight falls on
                what he says. That is a bit ironic, because it is only towards
                the end that this lengthy debate has sparked into life. I have
                never seen the Member for East Antrim (Mr Beggs) — who seems
                to have got a little tired — so animated. We can always rely
                on Cllr Maginness — I mean Mr Maginness: I thought I was
                somewhere else — to get animated when his argument is weak. He
                always uses bluster to cover the weakness of his argument.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to make the position clear from the
                start: the DUP is opposed to the Budget. We are opposed to it
                for a number of reasons, and I will go through them. The
                criticisms that have been made to date have fallen into two
                categories. They focus either on the way in which the money is
                to be raised to finance this programme, or on the ways in which
                the money is to be spent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I will deal with the arguments which
                have been put forward about the way the money is to be raised.
                My Colleague Mr&nbsp;Dodds made a very clear point in his
                opening remarks for the party, and I want to reinforce it now at
                the very end of our submission. We do not believe that the
                proper way to raise money for this programme is to keep the 8%
                increase in the regional rate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Incidentally, that increase was introduced
                under the direct rule Administration and we were told at the
                time that it was specifically ring-fenced for two years as the
                capital investment needed for the infrastructure for the Water
                Service. In spite of the fact that the two&nbsp;years have now
                passed, we are simply having it added on once again. I see that
                it has been described in many ways: the Durkan tax, the SDLP
                stealth tax, the sneaky tax. The whole point about it is that it
                has no transparency. I do not believe that that is the proper
                way to raise the money required for this programme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many suggestions have been made by Sinn
                Féin. We got the usual thing — the people who hate the Brits
                hold out their hands and tell us that the Brits should pay up.
                That is what we got from Gerry&nbsp;McHugh. I think he said it
                in Irish, I am not too sure. He said that the British Government
                must bear their responsibilities for what has happened over the
                last 30&nbsp;years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My recollection is that over the last
                30&nbsp;years billions of pounds have been spent in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland that could have been spent on improving
                the infrastructure. Billions of pounds have been spent undoing
                the work of the bombers, compensating families who have had
                people killed and trying to increase investment in an economy
                that investors were scared of, or scared out of. All that was
                not because of the activities of the British Government but
                because of the activities of the very people who, begging bowl
                in hand, are now demanding that the British Government should
                live up to their responsibilities and give us the money for this
                programme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not too sure where the Alliance Party
                wants the money to come from. I know where it does not want it
                to come from. It does not want it to come from the rates or from
                rent rises or from the tax powers which may come to the
                Assembly, because it has consistently refused to admit that the
                tax powers are actually tax raising powers — it calls them tax
                variation powers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Close said I was a slow learner, but
                I do know that you cannot have a spending programme financed by
                lowering taxes. That is one thing I do know — slow learner or
                not. What is worse, apparently this Programme for Government is
                not even sufficient for the Alliance Party.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yesterday, in five&nbsp;minutes, I counted
                six new things that Mr&nbsp;McCarthy wanted, and because he did
                not get the rest of them in he mentioned a few more things
                today. Eileen&nbsp;Bell wanted more money for five different
                things which she said either were not covered in the Budget or
                were not covered sufficiently.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr McDonnell:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr S Wilson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It does sound a bit like Santa Claus.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, despite this, taxes are not to be
                raised. They are to be varied, the regional rate increase is to
                be stopped and somehow by magic it is all going to be financed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close suggested that administration costs
                be reduced, but they will not be reduced in the Province
                overnight — and certainly not by the end of December. The
                First Minister, who also thinks that a magic wand can be waved
                to get things done, is talking about public administration being
                looked at in a year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All attempts, to date, at changing the
                administration of Northern Ireland by the pro-agreement parties
                have not saved money — they have cost money. There have been
                extra Departments, North/South bodies, about 15 review bodies
                — I think that is what the First Minister told the House —
                and the Civic Forum, so the forays into administration have not
                led to any savings.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is very courageous of Mr Close to suggest
                that looking at administration costs might save money. That is
                paramount to a redundancy programme for half the Alliance Party.
                The Alliance Party peoples the bodies that he is seeking to save
                money from. I hear that the Alliance Party has an alternative to
                ‘Who Wants to be a Millionaire?’ it is a game called ‘Who
                Wants a Quango Chair?’ I imagine that some of Mr Close’s
                party members might not be too pleased at his suggestion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When Members vote on the Programme for
                Government they should look at the issues where there is no
                added value, or at those that will lead to discrimination in
                favour of some of the politically correct issues included in the
                Belfast Agreement. Look at those things and vote against them.
                That is the immediate way of dealing with the issue. Members can
                do that before the end of the financial year so that the
                Programme for Government can go ahead with those changes. It
                will be interesting to see if the Alliance Party will be
                prepared to go along with those immediate remedies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a pity that the Chairman of the Social
                Development Committee is not in the Chamber. Mr&nbsp;Cobain told
                us how deeply he felt about the poor people living in Housing
                Executive houses who were going to be pushed to the poverty line
                and to starvation by a rent increase. He blamed the Minister for
                Social Development for something that has not even happened yet.
                He blamed him for intending to put these people on the breadline
                as a result of the impending rent increase.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Cobain must have gone to the same
                mathematics class as Mr Close. He said that the Minister for
                Social Development intends to raise rents by 20%. He has not
                been able to explain where he heard that, but he said that
                publicly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Cobain is not here, but he did have some
                cheerleaders when he made his impassioned speech on behalf of
                the impoverished tenants in Housing Executive houses. Mr Davis,
                a Deputy Whip, was cheering him on. Since Mr Cobain is not here
                to reply, maybe one of his Colleagues will answer on his behalf.</p>

                There are people such as Mr&nbsp;McElduff who would say that to
                cut North/South bodies would be to reduce a service provided by
                a very important element. Mr&nbsp;McElduff, in his usual
                Republican rhetoric, went overboard and talked about the
                all-island economy, this new Canaan —a land flowing with milk
                and honey. Mind you, he is not too far removed from the leader
                of the Ulster Unionist Party who eulogised about North/South
                bodies and how important they were in developing an all-island
                economy when he was questioned by Mr&nbsp;Dodds, Mr&nbsp;Poots
                and myself on the Programme for Government. He also talked about
                sailing down the river during his holidays and how the tourist
                body would help to promote that.</p>

                mention was made — as I pointed out to the Member for East
                Antrim and I am not going to point it out again — about
                administration costs in some of the Departments. Ironically, the
                First Minister’s Department is the one that has had the
                highest departmental expenses.</p>

                Departments, which Members from his party have responsibility

                although it was on the same line as all the others being read.
                He will notice, however, that the lowest increase is in a
                Department run by a DUP Minister. The increase for the
                Department for Regional Development is 3·5%, and that is the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The odd thing — and the record, which the
                Member can check tomorrow, will show this — is that the Member
                went through the catalogue of figures that he referred to. He
                went through the figures for administration and quoted the
                departmental running costs on every occasion. That is the figure
                on which he based his complaint about administrative costs. I
                have made it quite clear, and the Budget makes it quite clear,
                that the lowest increase in departmental running cost was for
                the Department for Regional Development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to speak for a minute about education.
                I notice that the Minister of Education is not here today, in
                spite of the fact that yesterday a Sinn&nbsp;Féin spokesman,
                who was trying to play down the row about the flying of the flag
                over this Building today, stressed the importance of today’s
                Budget and said that the Sinn&nbsp;Féin Ministers would be
                playing a full role. It is a great pity that the Sinn&nbsp;Féin
                Minister of Education is not present to hear some of the views
                being expressed. If the flying of the flag above this Building
                keeps Martin&nbsp;McGuinness out of it, I would advocate that we
                fly it every day.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we look at the figures for the Department
                of Education, we find that the departmental running costs have
                gone up by 11·9%. However, the Minister expects schools to
                exist on an increase of only 7·2%. He cannot live within
                certain figures, yet he expects schools to live within a far
                smaller increase. On top of that, he is squandering money on yet
                another body to oversee Irish-medium education. He wants to
                discriminate in favour of Irish-medium education and integrated
                education. I hope that we will see a less biased use of the
                Budget next time. In the past, the Minister of Education has
                also dealt with the money that he has been given stewardship of
                in a most cavalier manner, as can be seen in the way that he
                divided up the capital spending last year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I just want to come to the last point, and I
                see that Mr&nbsp;Alban&nbsp;Maginness has gone. No, he has not.
                I thought his pseudo rage was spent earlier on. Comments were
                made about the performance of the Minister for Social
                Development and the effect that his poor performance and
                non-attendance at the Executive was having on the waiting lists
                in north Belfast.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am the first to admit that there is great
                housing need in north Belfast. It is important that funding be
                made available to ensure that the housing programme for North
                Belfast is put through. Mr Maginness is known for the sharpness
                of his mind and the brilliance of his logic — and his French,
                of course — but they were not demonstrated today. He
                criticised the Minister for Social Development for not getting
                enough money for housing in North Belfast because he did not go
                to the Executive. He had hardly got the words out before he was
                praising the Minister for Regional Development, who also did not
                go to the Executive, for getting so much money for the railways.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Either you get the money because you go to
                the Executive, or you do not get the money because you do not go
                to the Executive, but you cannot have it both ways. At the end
                of the day the Budget and the way the money is divided out fall
                at the door of his Colleague. I am sure that he has spoken to Mr
                Durkan about housing need in north Belfast. It appears that his
                pleas have been ineffective, because the money has not been
                allocated. However, when it comes —</p>

                Maginness made a passionate plea to the Minister of Finance to
                hear the call from north Belfast, and surely that was good

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister for Social Development made his
                point to the person who makes the final decision on the Budget.
                Many people would say that the drift in the amount of money
                available for the housing budget has actually stopped as a
                result of the representations made by the Minister for Social
                Development. In previous years there was a large fall in the
                housing budget, which has now stopped, and the Minister needs to
                be thanked for that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the end of the day Mr Maginness, and
                others who feel strongly about this, will have the opportunity
                to vote for money for housing when amendments come before the
                House. As he has quite rightly told us, there is a cake that
                needs to be sliced up, and we will be suggesting were the slices
                could be made smaller with the minimum of pain. I look forward
                to his support in times to come.</p>

                interesting to note the areas that have been covered with the
                main argument being over how to raise money to fund the

                letter in my pigeonhole from Mr&nbsp;Gibson, the DUP Member for
                West Tyrone. Mr Gibson has invited Members to a special meeting
                in the Long Gallery to discuss how to reward councillors
                adequately, how to acknowledge many years’ service for which
                they were paid. Perhaps the DUP, in its enthusiasm for saving
                money, could tell us how this will be funded and what policy of
                the rest of the House, unpopular to the DUP, it wants to remove.

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today I listened very carefully when
                Mr&nbsp;Robinson told us about his new colleague Rover, which is
                of as much political importance as the contribution he has just
                made.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I even heard a jocular suggestion from behind
                me that perhaps Rover is the new Minister-in-waiting. He could
                be a Minister for Regional Development who knows that sheep do
                not graze on the Mournes in winter. However, I have only two
                areas to comment on.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have been asked to deliver the first
                comment on behalf of the Committee I chair — Culture, Arts and
                Leisure — and I want to raise a few points with the Minister
                for the record. The Committee wants to express its
                disappointment that many of the bids that the Committee made
                have not been granted. Historically, the Department’s existing
                activities have been underfunded and for this reason more money
                should be made available. Members might be interested to know
                that there has been no Budget increase in any of the major
                activities of the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure for
                almost 10&nbsp;years. Consequently, there has been a reduction
                in available funding. There is a serious need to readjust that.
                The Department’s total bid was modest when compared to its
                assessment of need, and yet little more than 25% of it was
                agreed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee is particularly concerned that
                the £2 million bid to buy out commercial fishing nets around
                the Northern Ireland coastline was not successful. In the
                Committee’s inquiry into inland fisheries, commercial netting
                has been identified as a major contributor to the decline in the
                salmon population of Northern Ireland’s rivers. If there is
                one thing we can do to help stabilise salmon stocks, this is it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee’s inquiry into inland
                fisheries has underlined the importance of an attractive
                recreational tourist industry to the Northern Ireland economy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee believes that the Department
                must pursue other resources to get the buying of commercial
                fishing nets started as soon as possible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee was also concerned that the bid
                for arts funding has only been met in part. Inevitability, this
                will be detrimental to the Department’s plans to open up the
                arts to a greater proportion of the people in Northern Ireland
                and, by doing so, to improve the quality of life for all. I can
                announce that the Committee has decided to make accessibility to
                the arts the subject of its next inquiry. I can almost guarantee
                that this will draw attention to the lack of funding available.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also noted that the Department’s
                spending plans do not include any funding for safety
                improvements to existing motorcycle road-racing facilities. We
                are all aware of the major concerns that surround that sport. It
                has been the subject of much debate — by the Committee and in
                the Department and the various groups involved in the sport —
                and it is an area that requires urgent attention. It is vital
                that funding be made available for safety in this sport. Even
                small amounts of money would go a tremendously long way in
                trying to improve the situation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department ought to pursue this
                underfunding situation rigorously by registering its
                disappointment at the shortfall in the meeting of the bids and
                by looking for additional funding in future years. The Committee
                pledges its support for the Department in that activity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second area that I will comment on
                relates to my membership of the Social Development Committee,
                and my interest in housing in particular. I express, as other
                Members have done, deep concern that the funding bid for north
                Belfast was not met. When bidding for funds, one expects not to
                get every bid that one puts in. That is understandable. However,
                it is a great pity that this bid failed, because, as almost
                everyone is aware, there is a great need for housing in the
                north Belfast area. People should also be aware that the
                strategic plan prepared by the Housing Executive is very
                imaginative, thorough, competent and realistic. It was a great
                disappointment that the money was not found to begin to
                implement it properly this year. My Colleague Alban Maginness
                has dealt extensively with the matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I believe — and I am not saying this to
                score a political point — that had the Minister for Social
                Development been in there fighting his corner, his arguments,
                backed up by such an imaginative plan, would have made a
                significant impact in favour of securing that additional
                funding. I do not think that any of his supporters here this
                evening would disagree with the fact that he could have made an
                impact. I believe that he would have liked to do so. I had hoped
                that a start could have been made. It is not necessarily the
                Minister that I criticise; it is the foolish policy of the DUP
                in not involving itself in the central and full Executive
                activity. That is a great pity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will not comment further. All other aspects
                have been adequately covered in this wide-ranging debate.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Finance and Personnel (Mr
                Durkan): </b>I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to
                this debate. I was grateful too for the opportunity of listening
                to it, even though I felt at times that I was in detention. It
                has been a useful debate. I am sure that all Members of the
                Assembly will join with me in thanking the Finance and Personnel
                Committee for its work that has led to today’s debate. I look
                forward to the further results<b> 
                </b>
 of its work that will flow
                from the debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At times this has been a constructive debate,
                and it has certainly been wide-ranging. The draft Budget is
                obviously an important document that requires careful study by
                the Assembly and by the respective departmental Committees. It
                has been guided by the Programme for Government, which was
                debated yesterday — albeit not in the most satisfactory
                circumstances, given time constraints. In time, through the
                allocation of resources, this Budget will clearly support the
                objectives of that Programme for Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have listened carefully to the
                contributions made to the debate. Together with colleagues in
                the Executive, I will reflect on the concerns expressed by
                Members and on some of the suggestions made both here and at
                Committee level. I know that the Finance and Personnel Committee
                has further work to do to prepare conclusions, which I will find
                very helpful in understanding fully, and in reconciling, some of
                the diverse views on the draft Budget which have been expressed
                in the Assembly and its Committees. Those conclusions will need
                to be available in time for consideration of any revisions to
                the Budget for the next financial year. We need to complete
                those revisions early in December, so that a revised Budget can
                be introduced on 11 December, prior to the final vote, which,
                subject to the usual consideration of timetables by the Business
                Committee, is scheduled for 18 December. Obviously, the
                timetable is tight, and the cycle has been very demanding for
                all concerned. However, even with those difficulties, the fact
                that we are engaging in debates on a Programme for Government
                and a Budget manifests clearly the real politics that have been
                made possible by the Agreement and the new arrangements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The revised Budget will include some
                clarification and some adjustment of the figure work. At a more
                significant level, the Executive will wish to consider whether
                changes could be made to improve the balance between spending
                areas. The views of the Assembly on this point will obviously be
                important. In principle, with a fixed departmental expenditure
                limit, any increase has to be offset by a corresponding
                decrease. We will, as ever, continue to look in the Departments’
                planning figures for any savings which could be redeployed. It
                is clearly a very important principle that money not required
                for the purpose for which it was originally allocated should be
                reabsorbed for reallocation by the Executive and the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There were several contributions during
                yesterday’s debate, and again today, on the difficulties
                arising from the Barnett formula. As I have made clear on many
                occasions, the Executive is determined to seek the best possible
                outcome for our spending processes, and we do not find the
                Barnett mechanism satisfactory or appropriate. While seeking
                additional resources from the Treasury however, it is important
                to bear in mind that we are likely to be regarded as well
                provided for, and it may be argued that we do reasonably well in
                terms of parity service. There is much to discuss. This is not a
                matter of simple tactics, or of walking into the Treasury and
                getting things changed overnight by Barnett-storming. Clearly,
                there are delicate and sensitive issues involved — not just
                for ourselves, but for others elsewhere as well.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to look very carefully at the
                regional rate which, as everyone is aware, forms an important
                part of the financing of our spending power. I have already
                indicated that we propose a substantial review of rating policy.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fact that that review is pending does not
                mean, if we choose to forgo revenue in the meantime from the
                source that the rates offer, that it is not going to be very
                difficult to expect the Treasury to make up the resulting
                deficiency in our spending power. Any deficiency that we choose,
                by either abolishing or not increasing the regional rate, will
                have to be lived with or made good by ourselves. It is not a
                deficiency that the Treasury will pick up.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The reality is that there are limitations on
                our allocation, and that is unsatisfactory for all the reasons
                that Members have identified. I am glad that Members appreciate
                the significance of the Barnett formula and that they are
                becoming aware of its adverse effects, which will be compounded
                further over time. There would not have been that appreciation,
                nor would there have been that degree of political or public
                awareness, were it not for the fact that we now have the various
                institutions in place. That itself is a score for transparency
                in relation to our Budget-setting exercises.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive is determined that the
                resources available are used in the best possible way and that
                action is taken to improve efficiency and effectiveness, and the
                targeting of actions on a priority basis. That is constantly
                emphasised in the Programme for Government and the Budget. We
                need to work together to maximise our advantage in relation to
                the Treasury. That is central and important.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that Members appreciate that, within
                the available resources, more money can only be spent in one
                area if there are offsetting reductions elsewhere. The Executive
                will therefore need to be convinced that the benefits of any
                proposed changes will clearly outweigh the sacrifices that will
                have to be made in other service areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A number of points and questions have been
                raised during the debate, and I will cover as many of those as I
                can now.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Molloy, as Chairperson of the Finance and
                Personnel Committee, made a point that was taken up by others,
                including Mr Close, Mr Neeson and Mr Beggs. That question was in
                relation to the difficulty arising from the timetable and the
                process that we are dealing with this year. It has been
                constrained, and it does cause difficulties for all concerned.
                That includes the Executive as well as the Assembly and its
                Committees. The intention is that the cycle will be different
                next year and that the agreed Programme for Government should be
                the starting point to inform the process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members should appreciate that when we adopt
                the Programme for Government in the new year it will lay down a
                prospectus, including budgetary precepts, for future years.
                Those precepts will already be there. They will be information
                that the Assembly and the various Committees will already have.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we present the revised Budget in
                December we will also present indicative figures for the
                Departments for years two and three. Mr Dodds raised the point
                that the draft Budget statement presented indicative figures for
                the Executive programme funds for years two and three, but not
                for the Departments. At the time of the Budget statement, given
                that people were criticising the fact that the draft annual
                Budget for next year was published before the Programme for
                Government, I made the point that it would have been ridiculous
                for us then to have issued full indicative allocations for all
                three years. We want to continue the work on those indicative
                allocations for years two and three.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members and Committees should remember that
                they will have that work available to them as well. That is
                information that the Committees can use and work on from now on
                — they do not need to wait for a starting gun from me, the
                Executive or anyone else.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committees can carry on the important
                scrutiny work that many Members have emphasised, and they are
                free to pursue that on the basis of that information to see how
                good the plans are for that expenditure. When we bring forward
                the consolidated Programme for Government in January it will
                include detailed public service agreements for the Departments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those public service agreements must spell
                out the actions and targets. That will assist the Committees in
                monitoring and tracking the performance of Departments — or
                those who are using departmental money — and the effectiveness
                of spending. That is all information that will contribute to the
                Committees’ being able to get into their stride in their
                important role.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fact that we are changing the nature of
                the information and management systems means that Committees can
                do much more, all year round, in advancing probing and
                developmental work in these areas. There is no question of
                Committees being denied opportunities. The arrangements that
                will be brought forward will equip and enable them to perform
                their role and their public duties in a way that satisfies them
                and is much more effective.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I have already mentioned, I agree that
                next year we should introduce the Budget at an earlier stage. We
                will be able to do that, as we will be working in a more
                established context because we will have the Programme for
                Government and the indicative allocations for the next two years
                already established.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie raised a number of points,
                particularly in relation to the budget of the Department of
                Higher and Further Education, Training and Employment. He
                touched on the issue of adult basic education, a subject that
                John Dallat also mentioned. I recognise, and the Executive
                recognises, that serious problems exist. The Department will be
                able to compete for Executive programme funds to supplement the
                amount that has been allocated. The provision made for the
                Department will allow for pilot projects to take place, and the
                Minister, Seán Farren, has made it clear that he will be using
                money from the Department’s budget to do that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie, Mr McGrady, Mr Dodds and several
                others highlighted the limitations of the Barnett formula and
                asked what was being done about it. As I said in my opening
                remarks, Barnett is a flawed mechanism that does not directly
                address need. That said, it has the attraction of being
                reasonably simple to apply. Once we get the allocation, we have
                discretion in how we use it, rather than having to trace and
                clear everything through the Treasury. The Barnett formula,
                however, is a very serious problem for us in that it does not
                address need or allow us to get the increases in service
                spending that are going elsewhere as part of the headline
                announcements made during the summer. It raises issues of basic
                equity that we want to address properly and competently.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we set out to do this at Executive
                level, not everyone counselled us that we should do so. Some
                counselled against raising the issue with the Treasury at all.
                It is interesting to note that more people are now of the view
                that we need to take up this issue robustly, with a planned
                approach. We must take a planned approach because the Treasury
                is not an easy touch on anything, and it is certainly not going
                to be an easy touch on this point. It will respond in ways that
                challenge aspects of our situation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Representations were made in the context of
                the 2000 spending review. The scope of the Barnett formula was
                increased as a result of representations from the First
                Minister, the Deputy First Minister and myself to the Chief
                Secretary to the Treasury. That increase in the scope of the
                formula gave us more than £40 million more on our baselines
                over the next three years. That is welcome but not enough. I
                remind Members that when a lot of people raised concerns, they
                were about the £23 million that the Treasury had wrongly
                allocated to us, and then took back.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People are not so appreciative of the fact
                that we managed to increase the amount of money allocated to us
                under the formula — we secured a &quot;Barnett&quot; share of
                money, which had originally been allocated to London transport.
                There has also been some improvement in the way that abatement
                has been handled: this was achieved during the summer. We will
                be seeking to ensure that a more equitable means of funds
                allocation is adopted before the next spending review.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The allocations announced by the Chancellor
                of the Exchequer are to last for the duration of spending review
                period. Therefore we need to mount the best possible case, with
                strong arguments, so that by the next spending review we have a
                strong basis, better than the Barnett formula, for winning our
                share of resources.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds suggested that there were
                discrepancies in figures for North/South bodies which were
                presented to the Finance and Personnel Committee. The figures
                refer to two different periods: the £8·2 million figure quoted
                referred to the 2000 calendar year, while the £8·9 million was
                quoted in relation to the 2000-01 financial year. That figure
                also included an allowance for the tourism company. The overall
                figure of £18 million which was referred to covers the
                financing of all bodies and their activities in the 2001-02
                financial year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reference was made to the expenditure by
                bodies of £11 million on political initiatives. This money was
                not spent on political structures but on ongoing services, such
                as inland waterways and trade and business development. The
                funding allocation for the tourism company will pay for a major
                publicity drive to market the region as a tourist destination,
                something that is clearly needed, and from which there will be
                direct economic benefits.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds, and others, raised the issue of the
                regional rate. Income from the regional rate can fund any
                service, which gives the Executive maximum flexibility. I
                underline the point that it is the Executive Committee that
                agreed these budgetary provisions in their entirety, in case
                some Members do not fully understand that. These increases are
                needed to deliver the services set out in the Budget and without
                them we would have to adjust the Budget accordingly. Therefore,
                if a lower regional rate is to be fixed, where should
                expenditure be cut?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Beggs sought a comparison between rates
                bills in Northern Ireland and those in England. An average rates
                bill here is significantly lower than an equivalent council tax
                bill in England, where households also pay a water charge
                something that must be considered. These are the arguments that
                the Treasury will raise when we begin negotiating the Barnett
                formula. When we state our particular need and argue that
                resources are not sufficient, others will wonder why we do not
                supplement our resources through the means available to us. They
                will also point out that households in Northern Ireland pay a
                significantly lower rates bill, compared to that paid by their
                English counterparts.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members quoted sections on rolling
                forward from my budget statement. My Budget statement was
                transparent. It was clear and open. It is on the record, and it
                can be seen we will be rolling forward the 8% increase that was
                allocated in the comprehensive spending review. That has been
                said here in public, so this is not a stealth tax, it is not a
                back-door affair. It is in print and Members have been able to
                quote it here. We need to make a distinction between rolling
                forward the expenditure plans we inherited which we clearly are
                not. This would have been the third year of the comprehensive
                spending review, and spending patterns are different from those
                that were intended so there is a distinction to be made between
                not rolling forward the expenditure plans and rolling forward
                some of the funding, and that is what was done.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members, Sammy Wilson in particular,
                raised the point that in the comprehensive spending review,
                increases of 8% in the regional rate were earmarked for
                two&nbsp;years. In fact, increases of 8% were earmarked for
                three&nbsp;years. Mr&nbsp;Wilson pointed out that when that was
                revealed, the Minister who had responsibility for finance and
                personnel at that time stated, in reference to the regional rate
                increase, that extra money needed to be invested in water.
                Members have been talking about various people’s having made
                impassioned pleas and bids. People have been making it clear to
                me that they wanted the indicative allocation for continued
                increased spending on water to be protected. They wanted the
                increased allocation in the comprehensive spending review to be
                protected and continued. Members should note that this budget
                sees it both protected and continued. People cannot have it both
                ways, which unfortunately they wish to.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The regional rate revenue is
                £318&nbsp;million. That figure has been built into the budget
                plans for 2001-02. To generate that revenue, we estimate, a
                regional rate increase of 8% in the domestic regional rate is
                needed, with an increase of 6·6% in the non-domestic regional
                rate, and on that basis we have presented these figures. In
                February 2000 we were able to make the decision not to have to
                follow through on the full level of increase that we had
                indicated in the draft Budget statement for the non-domestic
                regional rate, because the figures available showed some
                buoyancy, indicating that we could reliably set a lower rate and
                still achieve that estimated amount. I would like to remind
                Members of that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members are saying that this is, in
                effect, a tax. Mr&nbsp;Dodds has said that it is not justified
                to say that we need this to cover spending. If these rates can
                raise more revenue than that estimated, time might allow us to
                do a revision similar to that which we did earlier this year.
                This rate increase is not being pursued blindly as some sort of
                must-have tax, because I have said it is needed to cover
                spending. It is not a must-do levy. It is related to the amount
                of money that Ministers and Departments have agreed, at
                Executive level, that they need if we are to produce a budget
                consistent with the priorities laid down in the Programme for
                Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the terms of resources the best ready
                reckoner is that for each percentage point reduction in the
                regional rate uplift, our revenue would decrease by
                £2&nbsp;million. This would be a direct reduction in resources
                available to the Executive for the provision of public services.
                I make the point in answer to the question asked. The average
                domestic rate bill in Northern Ireland next year will be almost
                half of what will be levied in England. There is also the water
                charge to consider.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The percentage increase in the regional rate
                proposed for Northern Ireland is similar to that proposed for
                council tax in England. Seamus Close, Sean Neeson and others
                raised once again the question of tax-varying powers. As Mr
                Leslie pointed out, the Scottish Parliament has those powers but
                is not using them. One should also remember that 3p in the pound
                — if that is the extent of the tax-varying power we seek —
                would raise significantly less than the regional rate does.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members seemed to be suggesting that we
                abolish the regional rate, saying that it was fundamentally
                wrong and iniquitous and should not exist in any form. I took
                the logic of some Members to be that they were not so much
                against an 8% increase, but against the principle, and wanted a
                different form of taxation. Even if we were to apply the
                Scottish model, which is the only alternative that seems to have
                been suggested so far, it would not raise the money that the
                regional rate currently does. Something would have to give.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Seamus Close and Sean Neeson also seemed to
                be saying that we did not really need the regional rate in any
                case, since there were so many savings there for the taking if
                we only listened to the Northern Ireland Audit Office. We
                certainly want to achieve savings wherever possible, and the
                Department of Finance and Personnel is glad of any friends it
                can find in the Assembly when it comes to achieving savings and
                ensuring proper efficiency and soundness in spending. It seems
                strange for people to argue on the one hand that we do not need
                the resources the regional rate will give us, while also arguing
                that we need more than the Barnett formula provides and that we
                need some elaborate tax-raising powers. It simply does not add
                up.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close rather unfairly accused the
                Executive and myself of hypocrisy. I ask him to go and think
                through his own party’s position, for it cannot be the case
                that we simultaneously need and do not need the money, that we
                can raise it by different means, and that those means do not
                provide us with the requisite sum. I hope that there will be
                further thought on this matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to take up the positive suggestions
                such as making certain, through the various Committees, of much
                more efficiency in spending, and I look forward to that work
                succeeding. I remind Members that, when we bring forward matters
                like public service agreements in the context of the Programme
                for Government, it is precisely to insist that Committees and
                others perform that task better.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would also like to deal with the point
                about the housing budget and the question of Housing Executive
                rent increases. There seems to be a similarity between the
                arguments about the rates, not least from Mr Close, and those
                from Mr Cobain on housing and rent increases. There was an
                allegation that the Executive had no interest in targeting
                social need. Mr Close said that when Ministers get a sniff of
                power they forget about people in need and lose their social
                conscience. I have not lost my social conscience and am in no
                particular need of lessons from anyone.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are trying to discharge our responsibility
                to manage a Budget well and effectively, targeting it across
                many competing needs to meet a large number of serious
                pressures, in circumstances where we simply do not have enough
                resources to cover all those areas and do all that we would
                wish. People should recognise that, rather than take cheap shots
                about people losing their social conscience when they get a
                sniff of power. If we in this House can demonstrate that we have
                caught the whiff of responsibility, and show a degree of
                maturity and realism, we will be doing our work well.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The figures for the Housing Executive rent
                increase were based on national figures that put rent increases
                at GDP plus 2%. The Department for Social Development used the
                same guidelines. That is the assumption in those figures. If we
                do not hold to that, there will be a reduction of £7·8 million
                in the Housing Executive’s budget. Incidentally, that
                reduction figure is based on a revision of the previous figure
                of £5·4 million.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Cobain alleged that we have continued to
                cut the housing budget. In contrast to what was planned for next
                year under the comprehensive spending review, the Housing
                Executive budget will go up slightly, by 1·5%. The budget for
                housing associations, which are doing the new building, will go
                up by 6·4%. Mr Wilson recognised that what he called the fall
                in the housing budget has stopped. People will not be able to
                say that if we do not follow through with the rent increase. The
                Minister and the Department will make the final decision, and I
                understand that the Minister is awaiting the views of the Social
                Development Committee before doing that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should remember that there have been high
                levels of investment in public housing over the past 20 years
                — rightly so. We have inherited an infrastructure, even with
                all its problems, that is much better than that in England and
                Wales, and shows lower levels of unfitness. Also, under the
                house sales programme, the number of houses that the Housing
                Executive maintains continues to fall — it is down by over 15%
                in the past five years. People need to bear such points in mind
                as we deal with some of these questions. Predictably, I will
                make the point that 75% of Housing Executive tenants receive
                help with their rent through housing benefit. That goes some way
                to minimising the impact of the increase, although I recognise
                the effect of any rent increase on households on marginal
                income, particularly those that do not qualify for the relevant
                benefits.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots raised the question of funding for
                buses. An additional £1·7 million has been allocated to bus
                purchases in the Budget. The Department for Regional Development
                already gives Translink a grant equivalent to 50% of the cost of
                replacement vehicles. He also raised some questions about the
                budget of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.
                Expenditure on running costs for that Department in turn
                provides direct benefits to agriculture, such as the veterinary
                and scientific services. It is wrong for people to treat running
                costs as though they were just funding for idle bureaucracy —
                they support necessary services. If we were not proposing those
                increases, we would soon hear about how important some of those
                services are to farmers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Funding for victims is a matter of
                considerable concern to the Executive. We will address it
                shortly, when we clarify the position on the Peace II
                negotiations with the European Commission.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the division of
                responsibilities that Ms McWilliams mentioned, the NIO took the
                decision to set up the Victims Liaison Unit, and people know the
                basis on which that was set up. We sensibly decided that that
                did not preclude us, equally having a responsibility in relation
                to the scope of interest and responsibility that we have as a
                devolved institution, from showing proper consideration for
                victims in the work and service programmes undertaken by our
                Departments. That is our responsibility.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no pretence that the Victims Unit
                that is now being established in the Office of the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister will replace or displace
                any of the work that is being done by the Victims Liaison Unit
                in the NIO. It is to ensure that we show consideration for
                victims within our devolved responsibilities. If we had taken
                the other course, saying that there was already a Victims
                Liaison Unit in the NIO, people would really have had a case
                against us, that we were showing absolutely no consideration or
                regard to victims.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister brought forward the departmental designations that
                listed victims as one of the responsibilities for their
                Department, they explained that point well. They were not going
                to use the excuse that there was already such a unit in the NIO.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots and others raised the issue of
                e-government. Obviously, we attach a high priority to the
                effective use of technology in Government. The establishment of
                the Executive programme funds to cover service modernisation,
                with £3 million, £10 million and £20 million across the
                years, reflects that. As with the other funds, precise details
                of how it will operate are the subject of discussion and
                development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Patricia Lewsley mentioned the budget of the
                Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, with
                particular regard to equality. The sum of £1 million has been
                allocated to enable the Equality Commission to carry out its new
                statutory obligations under the Equality (Disability, etc)
                (Northern Ireland) Order 2000. That funding will enable the
                commission to provide services to people in the community with
                disabilities, employers and service providers, and to work
                towards the elimination of discrimination.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Lewsley also questioned the adequacy of
                the Department of Education’s budget. I believe that the
                proposed allocation strikes a fair balance between the needs of
                education and the very pressing needs of other services. Planned
                expenditure on the Department’s services will rise by 7·1%,
                bringing it to a total of £1·332 billion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The planned provision will enable existing
                levels of service to be maintained across the schools sector,
                youth service and community relations. School budgets will
                benefit directly from the extra £20 million in the Budget
                statement, continuing what was originally a one-off allocation
                of £14·7 million. The plan also provides for £3·5 million
                for the curriculum review, and £9·5 million to make good
                deficiencies in the school estate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even with all the difficulties we have under
                the Barnett formula, even if we are not able to match the rates
                of increase in spending in education and health that have taken
                place across the water, the Department of Education is getting
                more than its Barnett formula share, as is the Department of
                Health, Social Services and Public Safety. Even with the
                difficulties that we have, several Departments are giving
                increases over and above what their strict share would be under
                the Barnett formula.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Peter Weir emphasised the need to get better
                performance from additional money in education and health.
                Again, I remind people about the importance of public service
                agreements, and refer them to paragraph 1.3 of the actual Budget
                statement, which made it clear that any allocations are
                conditional on clearly identified actions and targets. I hope
                that people are not going to ask me to say that, and then forget
                about it when they get to work on the departmental Committees. I
                hope that all Members will bear that in mind.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jim Shannon raised the question of railways.
                Obviously, the Budget proposes an additional £19·6 million for
                investment in railways to implement the consolidation option.
                That is a significant increase on the £22&nbsp;million baseline
                that was previously planned for Northern Ireland’s railways.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the people who are welcoming
                these things in the Budget will vote accordingly. It seems
                strange that Members say that there are all sorts of things that
                they welcome, but because of some relatively smaller aspects of
                the Budget they want to vote against the whole thing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Monica&nbsp;McWilliams raised several points
                on foundation degrees. Pilot schemes to test the suitability of
                introducing foundation degrees in areas of high skill demand
                will commence next year. The costs are minimal in the first year
                and will be met from the Department of Higher and Further
                Education, Training and Employment baseline budget.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many people have said that Departments have
                missed out various parts in their bids and asked what we are
                doing in order to make this good and restore it. Twice in the
                course of my reply so far I have mentioned points that were not
                covered in the Budget statement for the Department of Higher and
                Further Education, Training and Employment, but that the
                Minister has subsequently said that he will now cover within his
                baseline. As I said on the day of the Budget statement, all
                Departments, on the basis of the allocations offered, can
                re-prioritise some of their expenditure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A case has been made, for instance, that the
                chronic housing problem in North Belfast is an absolute
                priority. I imagine that the Department and the Housing
                Executive, as the agency responsible for housing, will want to
                make sure that they do something about such a serious and
                pressing housing problem, rather than leaving it untouched just
                because it was not covered in the Budget. The departmental
                Committees have a particular contribution to make to ensure that
                they reflect the interests and insights that can help to inform
                any further re-prioritisation that Departments seek to apply to
                their budgets.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Monica&nbsp;McWilliams also asked what
                happened to Welfare to Work. Welfare to Work has, until now,
                been managed as a separate budget outside the Northern Ireland
                departmental expenditure limit. As I said in the Budget
                statement, on the basis of changes that have come through with
                and since the Chancellor’s summer announcement on the spending
                review, Welfare to Work moneys allocated to us will now come
                within the departmental expenditure limit and therefore will be
                at our discretion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the December statement, that money will be
                apparent in departmental budget lines. It is not apparent in the
                current budget lines, but it certainly will be when we bring
                forward the revised figures in December. The amount of money
                that we are getting for this initiative is going down because of
                falls in unemployment, et cetera.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Monica&nbsp;McWilliams also asked who has
                control over the Executive programme funds. The Executive
                Committee will shortly be considering options for the management
                of those funds. The expenditure will ultimately be accounted
                for, in the first instance, by any Departments that are given
                allocations from the funds. The funds themselves will be clearly
                monitored and managed by and on behalf of the Executive
                Committee, and there will be full reporting and transparency.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Both Monica&nbsp;McWilliams and
                Roy&nbsp;Beggs asked why departmental running costs are going up
                so much. Clearly, we have now 11&nbsp;Departments, and nobody
                ever denied that there would be some rise in central
                departmental costs. Departments are also carrying out an
                expanded work programme due to devolution in order to meet the
                needs of the Assembly and its Committees, and obviously to deal
                with some of the various other duties that the agreement imposes
                on Departments. All of that requires resources.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Also, many people are arguing for, and
                stressing the importance of, much better work going on between
                Departments, stronger interdepartmental work, more joined-up
                approaches, far more subcommittees and other communication
                between Departments. That all adds to departmental running
                costs. People cannot ask for all these improvements in how
                Government is run and then at the same time complain when some
                of the costs start to show in budget terms.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Departments have been under pressure
                with regard to departmental running costs. The Department of
                Finance and Personnel has had problems with departmental running
                costs due to the reallocation of responsibilities that came with
                the reorganisation of Departments. Several responsibilities came
                to the Department of Finance and Personnel, but the resources
                that previously covered those responsibilities stayed at other
                Departments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When Sammy Wilson says that the Department
                for Regional Development received only a relatively low increase
                on departmental running costs, he must remember that the
                Department for Regional Development kept some of the money that
                formerly covered the functions that went to the Department of
                Finance and Personnel.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to take account of the circumstances
                and needs of the Departments. Different Departments run
                programmes that have different cost profiles and different
                levels of policy and management input. It is unfair to compare
                one Department with another, particularly where new Departments’
                initial budgetary allocations did not properly reflect the cost
                base attached to their functions. That should be borne in mind
                by people asking those questions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is similar to the experience of the
                Assembly last year. Many Members were criticised for the
                significant increase sought by the Assembly Commission, and
                members of the Assembly Commission — including people from
                parties that are now criticising departmental running costs —
                were saying that the increases were needed because the previous
                assumptions were not soundly based.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Monica McWilliams asked about the Chancellor’s
                initiative and where it could be found. The Chancellor’s
                initiative money, where applicable, is clearly shown on the
                departmental tables. I will use the Department for Regional
                Development as an example. When I delivered the budget I talked
                about the increase for the Department for Regional Development
                as being 10·2%. People will see that figure in bold in the
                middle of the table. I could have gone for the figure of 15·2%
                at the bottom of the table to make the expenditure level sound
                greater. However, below the total departmental expenditure limit
                line, we have shown those moneys that would have been deemed to
                have been previously announced. Those include the Chancellor’s
                initiative, Peace I and Peace II moneys. That was precisely to
                ensure that there was no double counting. So the Chancellor’s
                initiative money is shown for each Department for this year —
                and last year where that is relevant — so that should be
                traceable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no Chancellor’s initiative money
                in the Executive programme funds, and I thought that that was
                clear from the previous statements. If it was not, then I
                apologise.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jim Wells welcomed the budget increase for
                the Planning Service. I welcome the fact that he welcomed that.
                Clearly, my Department tried to assist the very serious
                pressures that the Department of the Environment has been
                experiencing in the Planning Service and in the Environment and
                Heritage Service both in this budget and through some previous
                measures. Again, I hope that people who welcome these things
                will vote for the budget accordingly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells and Mr McHugh raised particular
                points in relation to the difficulties of getting designations
                for AONBs and ASSIs. We hope that the Planning Service’s
                sounder spending position will provide for some improvement in
                that area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells said that he believed the Planning
                Service should be made a Department in its own right. Here we
                have a party saying, on one hand, that we have too many
                Departments, that we should go back to the six, and, on the
                other hand, advocating the setting up of another Department.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">7.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells and Sean Neeson also raised the
                question of the Prescott money. As I have indicated, the
                allocation to Northern Ireland announced by the Chancellor in
                July included an amount determined by the Barnett formula in
                respect of transport. That ensured Northern&nbsp;Ireland
                received its share of the funding package subsequently announced
                by the Deputy Prime Minister. That was about £37&nbsp;million.
                If the First Minister, the Deputy First Minister and myself had
                not made representations to the Chief Secretary, we would not
                have received that money because London Transport money was
                discounted. However, we did not get an allocation of any Barnett
                formula comparison money in respect of the metropolitan
                railways. Our bid to the Chief Secretary to the Treasury was not
                successful on that front, but we were successful on the London
                Transport argument. That type of work has made it possible for
                us to provide the funding for railways that people have welcomed
                in the Budget.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we are to propose higher increases in
                transport spending, we must remember that these will be greater
                than the strict Barnett formula share of what the Department of
                the Environment, Transport and the Regions would allow. That
                puts our increased spending on transport in the same bracket as
                that on health and education. Even with all of our difficulties,
                we have managed to give it more than our Barnett formula share
                of the increase. I hope that people will recognise that given
                all the constraints that everyone has talked about, it has not
                been an easy task for the Executive. People need to be careful
                about thinking that things can be easily changed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;McHugh and Mr&nbsp;Wells mentioned
                the roads budget. The Department for Regional Development
                announced details of its major roadworks preparation pool in
                July. That will improve the strategic road network, and we want
                those schemes started, or completed, in the next five years.
                That pool includes a variety of road schemes together with those
                announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in May&nbsp;1998.
                In the Department for Regional Development table in the Budget,
                people should be aware that the moneys for the Chancellor’s
                Initiative are all going into roads. When people look at the
                total spend on roads they should take that money into account as
                well.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;McHugh raised some questions about
                agriculture. A range of measures is being supported to fight
                animal disease, notably TB and brucellosis testing and scrapie
                eradication. The total provision for compensation payments in
                the plan, not counting £2&nbsp;million on scrapie, would amount
                to £9·9&nbsp;million. That provision is clearly intended to
                provide compensation to farmers for cattle that have tested
                positive for TB and brucellosis, as well as for the additional
                costs incurred by private veterinary practitioners carrying out
                those tests.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If there were evidence that the Budget was
                being abused, which seems to be the implication, I would be very
                concerned about that and would be most interested in making sure
                that such evidence was brought to the attention of the relevant
                people. I hope that any such evidence would be forthcoming.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The spending plans contain the figure of
                £3·9&nbsp;million as the match funding contribution from the
                Exchequer. Modulation will apply across the United&nbsp;Kingdom
                at the same rates starting at 2·5% in 2001, rising to 4·5% in
                2005-06, with 100% match funding from the Treasury. If this
                money were not made available, the Department’s budget for
                rural development regulation measures would be significantly
                lower. That is another area in which the Executive has made some
                successful representations following the spending review
                announcements in July.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Among other things, Mr Neeson raised the
                question of the gas pipelines. I recognise the Assembly’s
                interest in that issue; it dates back to when we were in shadow
                mode. The Minister, Sir Reg Empey, is working on that matter,
                and Members will also be aware of the work of the regulator.
                There is private sector interest, and decisions will have to be
                made on a number of proposals. The section of the Budget that
                deals with the Executive programme fund for infrastructure and
                capital renewal makes specific reference to energy, and the fund
                can be used for that purpose. Obviously, however, the Minister
                of Enter- prise,Trade and Investment needs to assess the
                proposals coming from the private sector before any other
                decisions are made.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Neeson and other Members, including Ms
                McWilliams, raised the question of Peace II funding, and the
                transitional Objective 1 funds. The negotiations on the new
                community support framework (CSF) have now concluded.
                Negotiations on the two programmes began early in October, and
                it is hoped that the negotiations with the Commission will
                conclude by the end of this year. I have already written to
                those who are to be appointed to the three monitoring committees
                — the community support framework monitoring committee, the
                transitional Objective 1 monitoring committee and the Peace II
                monitoring committee. Those structures are new and differ from
                the previous monitoring committee structures, as a result of the
                consideration given to the matter by the interim CSF monitoring
                committee and the working group that it established. Obviously,
                we want those monitoring committees to make a contribution to
                the further development of our plans and proposals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The question of gap funding was raised. We
                made an allocation for that in the context of the Agenda for
                Government initiative. I said then and in the Budget statement
                that we would keep that area under review. People have raised
                particular difficulties with us, some of which are not
                necessarily as straightforward as they might seem, so we are
                trying to find the best way to deal with particular situations.
                Obviously, we are trying to move urgently to bring forward the
                new programmes, because the most important thing is to get them
                running. We want to make sure that people will still be in a
                position to take up the new programme money and make the most of
                it, building on previous important and positive experiences.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Neeson also raised a question about the
                new TSN measures. We are consulting on the equality implications
                of the Budget and have been in touch with the Equality
                Commission. We are also going through a wider consultation
                exercise that will include some public conferences. Mr Neeson
                referred to the Robson indicators. A review of the indicators of
                social deprivation and social need is under way. There has been
                public consultation and the relevant academics have been
                appointed. We are trying to come up with something that is much
                better than the Robson indicators; they served a purpose but are
                of only limited use now and do not reflect multiple deprivation
                in the way that they might. The Robson indicators miss out
                pockets of multiple deprivation, because they are based on
                wards. We will use new information systems, based on postcodes,
                for example.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope I have covered most of the main points
                raised. Many Members put forward particular suggestions and
                concerns, and we have a record of those. I have certainly taken
                extensive notes during this debate, and we in the Executive will
                reflect on what has been said today and whatever comes through
                from the departmental Committees, in particular from the
                Committee for Finance and Personnel, with a view to bringing
                forward a revised budget in December.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We want to ensure that we have good planning
                so that those who need to know what their allocations are, such
                as the trust and the schools, will know in time. If we do not do
                this in December, key services will be in a situation of
                uncertainty and in the position of having to start giving
                protective notice. I cannot emphasise enough the importance of
                reaching the budget decisions in December.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Confirmation of the Budget in December will
                help to confirm for Departments the allocations they will be
                working with and on which they should base their final work on
                the public service agreements. Those will detail the sort of
                actions and targets that everybody here is saying they want to
                see so that the Committees can perform their scrutinising role
                better and the public know what they are getting for this money.</p>

                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for
                Finance and Personnel (Mr Leslie):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not propose to wind up for as long as
                the Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope everybody will agree that this has
                been a useful debate. I thank all those who contributed to it. I
                also endorse the comment made earlier in the day by
                Mr&nbsp;Wells that it has been a proper debate. It is one of the
                few we have had in this Assembly that has taken place in a
                proper debating manner with the time for interventions, which
                was freely given and taken by Members. That is to be welcomed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will set out the steps that will be taken
                by the Committee to ensure that the views of the Assembly
                Members on the draft Budget, and particularly the views of the
                Committees, are brought to the attention of the Minister. Each
                departmental Committee was invited to provide the Department of
                Finance and Personnel Committee with its views on the Budget
                bids and on the proposed allocations for its Department. The
                Department of Finance and Personnel Committee asked for an
                indication of particular priorities to be attached to each of
                the budget headings and bids as well as any related factors that
                each Committee wished to be taken into account.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased to say that, despite the short
                timescale, most of the Committees have already provided a
                response, and we are grateful to them. Following this debate the
                Finance and Personnel Committee will prepare a report
                summarising the responses from the Committees, together with
                issues that arose during this debate. The report will
                incorporate the Committee’s submissions. While it will be
                addressed primarily to the Minister of Finance and Personnel,
                the report will be published for circulation to Members in the
                normal way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My understanding is that the Minister will
                take full account of the written comments from the Statutory
                Committees, together with the issues raised during this debate,
                when he and his Colleagues in the Executive make their final
                adjustments and refinements to the budget. Needless to say, in
                the course of debate a number of Members battled either on
                behalf of Departments which their parties represent or on behalf
                of Committees on which they sit. None laboured longer on this
                matter than the Democratic Unionist Party, as well it might. It
                was not there to labour long on these matters in the Executive
                so it had to make up for it on the Floor of the Chamber.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we have a debate like today’s, with
                all the parties represented — Sinn&nbsp;Féin here throughout
                today and members of the DUP referring by name to Members of
                Sinn&nbsp;Féin and the remarks they made in their debate — I
                have to ask what on earth is the difference between that and
                attending meetings of the Executive Committee? The only thing I
                would say in favour of their Ministers’ non-attendance is that
                a Committee of 10 is probably rather easier to work with than a
                Committee of 12.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have had quite a lot of discussion today
                about the rights and wrongs of the regional rate. If one decodes
                all the bluster, the core of the DUP position is that it wants
                to be seen to oppose the regional rate but it would quite like
                the proceeds to be hypothecated to those departments which it
                represents. And, of course, it wants someone else, mainly the
                Minister for Finance and Personnel, to take responsibility for
                raising the money which it would then spend if it could get its
                hands on it.</p>
                <i>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the subject of rates, the only way you
                have less tax is if you have less government. I am very much in
                favour of less government and thereby less tax. Sadly, we have
                had a regime in Westminster over the past three years that has
                increased the amount of government and the amount of tax. I hope
                our administration can, over time, address this situation
                because we do have to justify a better output for the money we
                spend. I am grateful to those Members who drew attention to the
                need to scrutinise the way in which money is spent and
                particularly that being spent on administration. I think the
                Assembly, in future years, should be working hard to try and
                reduce expenditure in those areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have never heard of a tax rise that
                stimulated an economy, but certainly tax cuts can do that. One
                only has to look south of the border to see the value of cutting
                taxes if you want to stimulate the economy. Therefore it would
                be a worthy objective to seek to reduce the burden of regional
                rates in the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do feel that the Executive is sensible to
                take an incremental approach to any changes it may make. As we
                are a new and inexperienced Assembly and Administration, it
                would have been unwise to make radical changes in the first
                years. The approach that has been adopted by this Executive is
                entirely sensible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We had some touching entreaties from certain
                Members of Nationalist and Republican disposition for more money
                that can only come from one quarter — the English taxpayer. It
                should be borne in mind that we spend £10 billion a year on
                administration in Northern Ireland. While no official figure is
                available, it is estimated, and not disputed, that the tax base
                in Northern Ireland is probably in the order of £5 billion. The
                question would therefore arise: if we have to pay our own bills,
                who would provide the other £5 billion given, as I have just
                said, that we are unlikely to stimulate the economy by doubling
                the rate of tax?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, these matters will be revisited in
                Plenary session when we deal with the final budget just before
                the December recess. While I am unable to assure the Assembly
                that the Finance and Personnel Committee will agree a report, I
                can assure the House that it will produce a report. That report
                will be given to the Minister of Finance and Personnel before
                that debate, and it will be published and available for use by
                Members in the debate.</p>
