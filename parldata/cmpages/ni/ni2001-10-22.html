                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. We meet
                today under most unusual circumstances. In the rest of the world
                there is conflict with terrorism, but in our country the
                Government seem more interested in making arrangements with
                terrorism than in preserving the basis on which the Assembly
                meets.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly is supposed to have
                cross-community representation, and cross-community votes were
                cast for the various ministerial posts and other jobs. All the
                Unionist ministerial positions are vacant at present, so the
                Government of Northern Ireland consists of a Nationalist and a
                Republican coalition. As I said to the Secretary of State, if
                the SDLP or Sinn Féin Ministers had left their posts, we would
                all have been out immediately. However, because the situation
                arose —</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. Will the Member come to his point of
                order? I am not clear on what it is.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">According to today’s news, the Secretary of
                State has congratulated Mr Adams and said that he will be very
                generous if Mr Adams does what the Secretary of State wants him
                to do. No self-respecting Unionist can remain in the Chamber and
                pretend that business can be done with a Government that is both
                Republican and Nationalist.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. The issue that the Member raises is
                political — it is not a point of order. The Assembly is
                entirely in order to sit, to hear statements from and ask
                questions of Ministers, and to conduct debates on matters that
                are properly on the Order Paper. I need to bring some
                substantial issues to the attention of the House. I intend to do
                so, but the Member’s point is not a point of order in respect
                of the House sitting. What he and his Colleagues choose to do
                from a political point of view is another matter — <i>[Interruption]</i>.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Well, I will not be taking any part in this
                charade.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. If I inform the House, and
                particularly those Members who have put down questions that will
                now fall, of the status of some of those matters, that may be
                helpful to those who wish to participate. I shall then take a
                point of order from Mr Trimble.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I confirm that on Thursday 18 October 2001 I
                received letters from the nominating officers of the Ulster
                Unionist Party and the Democratic Unionist Party notifying me
                that the Ministers from those parties had been dismissed with
                effect from midnight on that date. I advise Members of the
                implications that those dismissals will have for today’s
                Assembly sitting. The dismissals affect only those Northern
                Ireland Ministers who belong to the Ulster Unionist Party and
                the Democratic Unionist Party. Ministers from the other parties
                remain in their positions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Question Time will be affected. Sir Reg Empey,
                having been dismissed as Minister of Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment, can no longer carry out the functions of the First
                Minister. The Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister will, therefore, be unable to respond to questions for
                oral answer at 2.30 pm, nor will there be questions at 3.00 pm
                to the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure, who is no longer
                in post. Questions to the Minister of Agriculture and Rural
                Development will proceed. Ongoing business will be interrupted
                at 3.30 pm for that purpose, because that is the time when the
                Minister would normally have answered those questions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those questions for oral answer listed on
                today’s Notice Paper by the Office of the First Minister and
                the Deputy First Minister and the Minister of Culture, Arts and
                Leisure will fall. Members can of course table those questions
                again, and they can also table questions due for oral answer on
                12 November by the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy
                First Minister, the Minister for Regional Development and the
                Minister of the Environment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the six vacant ministerial
                posts, no questions for written answer will be accepted until
                Ministers are nominated to those positions. Questions that were
                tabled for written answer before the Ministers’ resignation
                will be answered immediately following the ministerial vacancies’
                being filled.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that I draw those matters to
                Members’ attention. I shall also ensure that the detail of
                that is put in the all-party notice for this week so that it is
                clear for Members and is in writing.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Trimble:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My point of order, Mr Speaker, is also a
                comment on the matters that you have just mentioned, because it
                has been necessary to reorganise the business of the Assembly
                following the vacancies that have arisen — and I am not
                altogether comfortable with the method that was used to bring
                about those vacancies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We were not anxious to see that happen. It
                has happened with a fair degree of regret on our part. I hope
                that this situation will be resolved quickly. It can be resolved
                by those parties that have so far been in breach of the
                agreement by failing to take effective steps to achieve the
                total disarmament of paramilitary organisations. That there are
                five vacant Ministerial posts puts us in a difficult situation.
                There are immediate implications for what can and cannot be
                done. The situation is not stable, and the Secretary of State
                should consider what to do in that regard.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I raised my point of order to endorse what Dr
                Paisley said about the need for a cross-community
                Administration. I was glad to hear Dr Paisley restate that
                principle, which is contained in the legislation and in our
                Standing Orders. What he said about the need for a balanced
                Administration was true, and I acknowledge the embarrassment
                that it causes to Members opposite who find themselves in an
                unbalanced Administration with no desire to be there. Dr Paisley’s
                party followed the Ulster Unionists into the Executive and onto
                the Policing Board. It followed the Ulster Unionists in
                withdrawing, and I am sure that it will also follow the Ulster
                Unionists when we go back.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ministers had two options: to resign or
                to be dismissed. The Ministers were dismissed, except for the
                Junior Minister in the Office of the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister, who could not be dismissed, except by the
                First and Deputy First Ministers acting together or by Ministers
                fulfilling the functions of the First and Deputy First Ministers
                acting together. The Minister could have resigned, but that
                option was not taken. The position is clear.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regarding the second point, Members may
                recall that, under Initial Standing Orders, an Executive could
                continue to function only on a cross-community basis. However,
                that Standing Order was not incorporated into the substantive
                Standing Orders, and therefore — whatever the political
                questions to which the Member refers — there is no reason why
                the Ministers currently making up the Executive cannot continue
                to fulfil their functions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is true that a substantial number of
                Departments have no political head. That has implications for
                the Assembly, and I have referred to the most immediate of those
                implications. It will affect Question Time today, the tabling of
                questions for oral answer and the tabling and answering of
                questions for written answer.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I regret that the DUP Members have absented
                themselves from the Chamber for this important statement, which
                has implications for an industry that is important across
                Ireland, North and South.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fourth meeting of the North/South
                Ministerial Council in its agriculture sectoral format was held
                at the Carrickdale Hotel in Dromad, County Louth, on Thursday 4
                October 2001. MrNesbitt, Junior Minister in the Office of the
                First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, accompanied me to
                that meeting and agreed this statement. The Government of the
                Republic of Ireland were represented by Mr Joe Walsh TD,
                Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, who chaired
                the meeting.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council considered and agreed a paper on
                animal health policy, with particular reference to
                foot-and-mouth disease. The paper gave details of the progress
                made on animal health policy decisions taken at earlier meetings
                of the North/South Ministerial Council. The Council noted the
                progress made in controlling foot-and-mouth disease and the
                co-operation on animal movement and epizootic disease control,
                animal health policy and scrapie control. In its consideration
                of those issues, the Council recognised the potential impact of
                foot-and-mouth disease on animal health in both jurisdictions on
                the island of Ireland. It was noted that the all-island approach
                to controlling the outbreak had minimised the spread and impact
                of the disease in both parts of Ireland.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council agreed that the experience gained
                during the outbreak clearly demonstrated the benefits of an
                all-island approach to animal health and called on Agriculture
                Departments, North and South, to proceed urgently with the work
                aimed at increasing such co-operation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council considered and endorsed a paper
                on the World Trade Organisation, EU enlargement, and common
                agricultural policy reform. The paper set out the common
                North/South interests and objectives in those areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council noted the concerns of Ministers,
                North and South, with the issues highlighted; their agreement on
                the objectives that should be pursued in negotiations; and their
                agreement to continue to review developments in those matters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council considered and noted a paper on
                the work of the steering committee on cross-border rural
                development, which outlined its progress on the work programme
                that the Council formally endorsed at its meeting on 17 November
                2000. The Council also considered a paper on the joint study of
                the pig industry that outlined the main conclusions of a
                consultancy study on pig-meat processing on the island of
                Ireland. That paper was commissioned by both Agriculture
                Ministers in December 1999. In noting the paper, the Council
                agreed that officials should continue discussions with the
                relevant development agencies and the industry to develop
                appropriate action to improve the competitive position of the
                pig sector on the island.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The secretariat tabled an additional paper
                seeking the Council’s approval of proposed salary, and salary
                range, increases for chief executive officers based in Northern
                Ireland with effect from 1 April 2001. The Council approved the
                increases subject to final approval by the Finance Ministers,
                North and South.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council agreed that its next meeting in
                the sectoral format will take place in Northern Ireland in
                February 2002. The text of a communiqué for issue following the
                meeting was agreed; a copy has been placed in the Assembly
                Library.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s statement,
                particularly her comments on an all-Ireland approach to animal
                disease control, cross-border co-operation on rural development,
                and the improvements to the competitive position of the pig
                industry, North and South. What cross-border provisions has the
                Minister made for the eradication of BSE, brucellosis and
                tuberculosis? Given that she set such a premium on cross-border
                co-operation with another EU state, will she indicate whether
                she has discussed the retirement scheme for farmers, North and
                South?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Savage will be aware that we have agreed
                an all-island strategy for the eradication of scrapie in sheep,
                which may mask the symptoms of BSE. However, the Department for
                Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and not the Department of
                Agriculture and Rural Development, is responsible for
                investigating BSE in sheep. My Department has a contingency plan
                that is out for consultation with the industry and other
                interested parties in Northern Ireland and the UK.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My officials were recently in Dublin to
                discuss TB and brucellosis controls in order to inform our
                decisions on the way ahead. We have agreed to establish an all-
                island animal health strategy, and that work continues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The early retirement of farmers was not
                discussed. I initiated a desk-based study on early retirement
                last year. It was inconclusive because of the absence of data.
                Therefore, I have initiated a study to be carried out by Queen’s
                University and University College Cork. I hope that their
                findings will be reported to me in the new year, and that they
                will look at the implications of early retirement, its
                cost-effectiveness and its impact on the restructuring that is
                essential for the industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report will be based on research that the
                industry does in other countries. When I receive the report, I
                will be able to judge whether early retirement will contribute
                to restructuring, and whether it would be a good idea. In the
                meantime, I shall keep that option open.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s statement and the
                progress that has been made under the various headings. What
                progress has been made in developing a strategy for animal and
                plant disease control? I refer in particular to brucellosis,
                which is endemic in my constituency and which causes
                difficulties for the farming industry. There has been a
                substantial increase in cases of brucellosis since 1996, at a
                cost of £22 million to the industry. The matter requires urgent
                attention. It must be eradicated and the carriers of such
                diseases must be controlled.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Brucellosis and tuberculosis are matters for
                concern. There has indeed been an increase in brucellosis, and
                we have been reviewing the strategy in Northern Ireland. When
                the working group set up under the North/South Ministerial
                Council arrangements carries out its work, we will be in a
                position to consider the elements of a cross-border strategy.
                Unfortunately, we have been unable to take that as far as we
                might have done because of the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak.
                Nevertheless, my officials were in Dublin last week to discuss
                the subject — and brucellosis — with their counterparts
                there. Progress has been made and will continue to be made to
                deal with the scourge.</p>

                welcome the Minister’s statement and the fact that the
                North/South Ministerial Council, which is so important to
                agriculture, is still meeting and making progress. The statement
                mentions an all-Ireland approach to disease, and, in particular,
                to outbreaks of foot-and- mouth disease. Work by Departments on
                both sides of the border minimised its spread and impact. Is the
                North/South Ministerial Council in agreement with Departments,
                North and South, that the way to a disease-free future is
                through an all-Ireland policy?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why were impact studies for foot-and-mouth
                disease carried out in some areas, but not in the Meigh border
                area, which was badly affected by the disease?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At a North/South Ministerial meeting in
                October 2000, before there was any suspicion that we would be
                affected by foot-and-mouth disease, Mr Joe Walsh and I agreed to
                work out a joint strategy on animal disease on the island of
                Ireland. During the foot-and-mouth crisis, that strategy was
                shelved because there was no time for people to work on it. Work
                has now resumed on its development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not sure what Mr McHugh was talking
                about with regard to the studies in Omeath. The Member will be
                aware that I am conducting an independent review on the
                foot-and-mouth epidemic. The remit is wide and will involve
                examining all aspects. Perhaps Mr McHugh could let me know in
                writing precisely what he has in mind, because I am not sure
                what he means.</p>

                matters for which they have responsibility. Problems usually
                arise when issues fall between the Departments’ areas of
                responsibility. That is also the case in respect of jurisdiction
                responsibilities. Despite the Minister’s success in many areas
                to date, she is not responsible for studies that take place
                outside her jurisdiction. The Member’s question can be
                answered only by the Minister responsible for that jurisdiction
                — in this case the Minister in Dublin. I hope that that
                clarifies the matter.</p>

                enlargement and reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP),
                an area that may change considerably in the future. Can the
                Minister say which interests were identified as common to
                Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and those which
                were not?</p>

                been placed in the Library. The main areas of common concern
                include: the impact on exports to third countries and further
                reduction in export refunds; the consequences of any further
                changes to CAP for producers; and the effects on farm incomes of

                value means providing quality services at a price that local
                people are willing to pay. Councils should therefore operate in
                a framework that is transparent and accountable to the citizens
                that they serve.</p>

                before the Assembly deals with primary education and the
                11-plus, an issue that is fundamental to every family in the
                North of Ireland. Is it not therefore an insult to the Assembly
                that the Minister of Education will not be in attendance to
                answer the finer points of the debate and to have exchanges on
                the matter?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been the custom in the Assembly and in
                other places that Ministers, if at all possible, attend debates
                on matters of their departmental responsibility to listen and to
                respond to points raised. If a Minister is unable to be present
                at a debate, be that on account of alternative arrangements,
                health matters or other reasons, a Colleague may act on his or
                her behalf. As a member of the Business Committee, the Member
                may wish to raise this question there. It would be inappropriate
                for me to comment other than on the simple procedural matter,
                which is that it is the custom, and the Minister has recognised
                that it is the custom and has written to apologise because he
                recognises that he is breaching the custom. The Member has said
                what he has said.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr J Kelly:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a further point of order, Mr Speaker.
                Surely the Minister’s absence is not for any frivolous reason.
                If the Minister were not absent on that business, these Members
                would be criticising him for not doing all that he could to
                ensure the survival of the Assembly.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is difficult for me, from the Chair, to
                decide whether the visit by the Minister is frivolous or
                otherwise. Perhaps only history will demonstrate that; it
                remains to be seen. It is clear that the Minister — in
                fairness to him — has recognised that he is not following the
                normal custom. He has written and tendered his apologies to the
                House and to me. It is proper to put that on the record, lest
                there be any sense that the Minister had not recognised that his
                non-attendance was an unusual matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would not be proper for us to extend this
                into a debate. Of course, if there are points of order I will
                take them, but only if they are legitimate points of order.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGrady:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further to that point of order, Mr Speaker.
                You read out a letter from the Minister of Education stating
                specifically that he is abroad on party business, not
                ministerial business. Surely the primary responsibility of a
                Minister who is being paid for the job is to be responsive to
                this Assembly when he has already agreed to be so by the
                arrangement of the business today?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From a procedural point of view, as Speaker
                of this House I of course regard the responsibility of a
                Minister to his ministerial job as being a primary one. However,
                I suspect that as everyone searches themselves and looks at
                whether their responsibilities are primarily to the House, their
                families, their parties or whatever else they have
                responsibilities to, they might come up with different answers
                to that question. The Standing Order position is clear — there
                is a primary responsibility to the House. The Minister has
                recognised that and has sent a letter of apology, which I have
                read into the record.</p>

                do not want to labour the matter, but surely Mr McGrady can
                recall when Ministers from his party were absent from the House
                when issues were raised that were relevant to their Departments.</p>

                that points of order which verged on the political would be less
                likely in the Chamber, but it does not necessarily appear to be
                so. As one can see, one just never knows what the future brings.</p>

                grateful to the Committee members for their assistance, good
                humour and hard work on the report. I also want to place on
                record my appreciation and gratitude to the Committee Clerk,
                Committee staff, the specialist adviser, Prof John Gray and the
                Assembly researchers for their hard work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is regrettable that the Minister of
                Education is not here on this important occasion. Whilst he has
                more pressing matters to deal with, his absence from the Chamber
                is most unfortunate. However, he has written to the Committee
                and myself apologising for his absence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 28 September 2000 the Minister of
                Education published the results of the research carried by Prof
                Tony Gallagher and Prof Alan Smith into the effects of the
                selective system of secondary education in Northern Ireland. At
                the same time the Minister launched a public consultation on the
                arrangements for post-primary education in Northern Ireland and
                formed an independent review body to consider and make
                recommendations on the matter. These actions sparked one of the
                largest debates on education here in a very long time — <i>[Interruption]</i>.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note that senior Colleagues are now
                deserting me.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee for Education believed that the
                issues under consideration were crucially important and that any
                decisions taken would affect generations to come. Whilst we did
                not want to replicate the review body’s work we felt that we
                needed to give the matter due and timely consideration. The
                purpose of the Committee’s report is to crystallise the views
                of the Committee and to enable us to carry out an informed
                assessment of the recommendations of the review body when they
                are published on 24 October.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee also decided that any evidence
                it gathered, its findings, views, and conclusions reached should
                be published to further inform consideration of the issues and
                contribute to the public debate that will ensue. We felt that
                that was important, as there appeared to be a lack of
                information to enable people to reach informed opinions on the
                various alternative systems available.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee agreed to consult with
                interested groups and organisations. Recognising that we could
                only hear evidence from a relatively small sample of the many
                groups, organisations, and individuals with an interest in the
                issue, we identified a number of key witnesses. We received
                written submissions and took evidence from, among others, the
                education and library boards; teacher and head teacher
                organisations; higher and further education organisations;
                employer organisations; and academics who have carried out
                relevant research. We also had access to the views and comments
                expressed to the review body through its web site.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To ensure that we received the views of
                parents, teachers and pupils, a number of focus groups were held
                on our behalf in Belfast, County Fermanagh and County Tyrone by
                the Assembly’s library and research staff. The results proved
                extremely interesting, and various views were expressed,
                particularly by pupils. The Education Committee also considered
                research papers on various alternative post- primary education
                systems and undertook visits to Kiel and Munich in Germany, as
                well as to Edinburgh and Glasgow, to see at first hand how other
                education systems operate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While the Committee recognised that it would
                be helpful to observe other systems, we acknowledged that a
                model could not simply be lifted from somewhere else and applied
                without account being taken of the unique circumstances and the
                historical context of Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I have illustrated, the Committee gathered
                a great deal of detailed information and a wide range of views.
                We are grateful to all those who showed such willingness to
                contribute. It was particularly important to establish a link
                with our counterparts in the Scottish Parliament. I hope that
                other Committees of the Assembly will pursue such links, where
                relevant to their responsibilities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will now outline the Committee’s key
                findings and conclusions. I am sure that my Committee Colleagues
                will also highlight these areas in their contributions to the
                debate. The primary legislation shaping the current system of
                education in Northern Ireland dates back to the Education Acts
                of 1944 and 1947, which resulted in the bipartite system. It
                has, relatively speaking, remained unchanged since then,
                although the Education Reform (Northern Ireland) Order 1989
                introduced greater parental choice, open enrolment and the
                introduction of a national curriculum.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Demands on the current system have changed
                dramatically. Whereas in times past, only a small minority of
                pupils was expected to achieve examination qualifications, a
                great majority now does so. Many would argue that the current
                system has served us well over the years. A number of the
                strengths of the current system were drawn to our attention.
                However, many others who gave evidence have suggested that,
                given changing expectations of education, substantial reforms
                are now required.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is clear from the evidence received by the
                Committee that three key issues need to be addressed. The first
                is the nature of the school curriculum and the opportunities and
                experiences available for all pupils. The second is whether the
                current arrangements for organising schools are appropriate for
                future demands or whether structural changes are required. The
                third is whether changes to the procedures by which pupils are
                allocated to post-primary schools are required.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Taking account of increased educational
                participation rates and the potential spare capacity in the
                system, the Committee believes that, irrespective of the
                arguments about the strengths or weaknesses of the current
                system, reorganisation and change seem inevitable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I come now to the 11-plus. It is clear that
                there is widespread dissatisfaction with the present transfer
                tests. I must stress that these are criticisms of the present
                tests, and it should not be assumed that the Committee is
                opposed to testing using alternative methods. Criticisms of the
                tests include the effect that they have of narrowing the primary
                curriculum, particularly in the final two years; the power of
                the tests to predict potential — many young people who are
                judged to have only modest potential often go on to perform
                well; and the extent to which stress and related factors affect
                the test performance and the longer-term consequences of pupils’
                self-esteem. Many witnesses also wished to see more effort being
                made to acknowledge parental preferences.</p>

                Chair)</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee believes that the two one-hour
                tests are no longer appropriate and recommends that the current
                tests should cease to be administered from a feasible future
                date. It recognises that this cannot happen immediately and,
                therefore, recommends that as an interim measure the Council for
                the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment (CCEA) should be
                instructed to undertake such improvements as can be made within
                a limited timescale.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee also recommends that a transfer
                profile seeking to combine the four elements — current pupil
                performance, other aspects of pupil development, parental wishes
                and teacher guidance — should be implemented as soon as
                possible in order to provide a fuller and broader picture of
                pupils’ achievements during their primary years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is apparent that the post-primary
                curriculum needs to be changed and updated to meet future
                requirements. There is great concern regarding the status of
                vocational education and the need to improve this. The need to
                provide choice and flexibility was also highlighted. In
                particular, local business organisations drew attention to the
                shortage of employees with the necessary skills and qualities
                for today’s workplace.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee is of the view that changes to
                the current curriculum are necessary and should be implemented
                as an integral part of any changes to the post- primary system.
                Specifically, the Committee recommends that a core curriculum
                should be offered for all pupils to follow until around the age
                of 13 or 14, with flexibility to reflect the needs and
                circumstances of individual pupils. Choices available to pupils
                should include academic, vocational and technical subjects.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Schools should explore collaborative
                arrangements with other institutions to ensure a range of
                opportunities for all pupils. A broad skill-based curriculum
                should be implemented, along the lines already recommended by
                the CCEA. A formal mechanism in which business and industry can
                highlight changing skill requirements at a relatively early age
                should be established. Stronger links between schools and higher
                and further education providers should be explored in order to
                increase flexibility of provision.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To inform the education system of the future,
                the Committee reviewed the strengths and weaknesses of
                alternative structures, including the current bipartite system,
                all-ability comprehensive schools, delayed selection systems and
                consortia of schools. However, in considering the way forward,
                the Committee wished to focus on the required outcomes of the
                education system rather than on the structure by which they
                would be delivered.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members will be greatly disappointed
                that the Committee has not made a recommendation in favour of
                one particular structure. We are all aware of the particular
                views of the political parties on this matter, and it was not
                the Committee’s intention or wish either to pre-empt the
                report of the Burns review or to do its job. The Committee
                therefore has recommended a number of key principles that it
                believes should underpin any future developments — for
                example, the social, economic and educational objectives of any
                future system must be clearly identified and stated. The
                Committee has outlined its views on what these should be, and I
                will come back to that shortly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any reforms of the current system should be
                phased in over a period of time and should involve key groups
                throughout the change process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That will be essential if change is to be
                managed. Any changes must recognise and build upon the current
                system’s strengths. The Committee for Education was
                consistently advised to retain the best and improve the rest.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Choices on post-primary schooling should be
                offered to pupils and their parents. The high educational
                standards achieved in Northern Ireland over the years must be
                maintained. However, strong action must be taken to tackle the
                perceived tail of underachievement. Any changes that are
                introduced must recognise that the commitment and contribution
                of all teaching staff will be central to the implementation
                programme. Whatever the nature of educational provision at
                post-primary level, parity of esteem must be achieved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The social, economic and education objectives
                of any future system must enable pupils to develop their
                potential; enable them to exercise ownership and choice; provide
                appropriate and varied opportunities to ensure the development
                of a well educated, skilled and employable workforce for the
                Northern Ireland economy; place greater emphasis on innovation,
                creativity and entrepreneurial skills; enable every individual
                to identify his or her aptitudes, interests and vocation in
                life; and improve the processes for identifying and addressing
                elements of deprivation that may impact on a pupil’s
                performance. At present, we are not meeting those objectives
                well.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have presented the report as Chairperson of
                the Committee for Education, and my party Colleagues will
                outline the Ulster Unionist Party’s position on the matter.
                However, my view is that the system should open up opportunities
                for pupils rather than close down their choices. Any new system
                must be fair to all, and it must build on and encompass the best
                of the current system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In considering the matter, the Committee was
                reminded on a few occasions of the opportunities and the
                responsibilities that it faces. For the system to change, it is
                essential that a high level of consensus be achieved. A
                consensus already exists in some areas, but in others it has yet
                to emerge. The report outlines the views of the Committee for
                Education, and it will enable the Committee to carry out an
                informed assessment of the Burns review body’s recommendations
                when it publishes its report on Wednesday.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I took pleasure in presenting the report. The
                Committee spent a long time considering this important issue,
                and I trust that it will make a significant contribution to the
                future. The Committee for Education looks forward to playing a
                full part in that process with the shared objective of improving
                the quality of education for everyone in Northern Ireland. I
                urge Members to support the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Lewsley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the opportunity to speak to the
                motion as a member of the Committee for Education and as
                education spokesperson for the SDLP. The SDLP views the
                education system as the cornerstone of society. Education is a
                fundamental human right, as well as being a key driver of the
                economy and central to personal development. Genuine equality of
                opportunity cannot be created without first securing an
                effective and well- resourced education system that is open and
                inclusive, flexible enough to cater to all needs, and responsive
                to the society that it serves.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The selective education system has done
                untold damage to generations of children. It has inaccurately
                tested them, artificially segregated them and precipitately
                closed doors to future careers. However, the damage to fragile
                self-confidence is unforgivable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since its inception, the SDLP has called for
                a new all-ability system to offer inclusive education that
                guarantees equality of opportunity for all. We have maintained
                our opposition to selection on the grounds that the system is
                unfair, divisive, ineffective, and damaging to children and
                society. The arguments have been made time and time again, and I
                will not rehearse them here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have acknowledged the initial benefits
                brought about by the introduction of the 11-plus in a post-war
                society in which standard education finished at 14. It opened
                the door to second-level education for a generation of children.
                However, modern society requires all children to be educated
                well beyond the age of 14. The second-level system must move to
                meet the needs of the twenty-first century.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SDLP acknowledges the concerns expressed
                that the significant achievements of the current system might be
                lost if selection were abandoned. The high academic results
                attained in grammar schools represent enormous dedication and
                skill on the part of staff and students. However, it does not
                detract from that to point out that selection brings children
                together from the most educationally advantaged backgrounds,
                socially and economically. The necessary corollary means that it
                comes as no surprise that schools face difficulties where the
                student body reflects disproportionately high levels of social
                and economic disadvantage. High numbers of young people leave
                school with few or no qualifications, and there are grounds to
                believe that the selective system has played a role in that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Gallagher report says that the
                differentiated pattern in Northern Ireland, with a consequent
                over-representation of low-achieving schools, may be the
                inevitable consequence of a selective system. There is a
                compelling case to be made for the fundamental reform of
                procedures for transfer from primary to post-primary schooling.
                That would entail fundamental reform to structures and curricula
                at post-primary level. It is vital that, in making the
                transition to a new system, the highest possible standards and
                quality of education are maintained and developed. In moving to
                implement such reform, the SDLP believes that, by teaching 11-to
                18-year-olds together, the highest academic standards of the
                present can be maintained and offered to a greater number of
                children alongside improved vocational and social development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The key principles that we wish to see
                maximised in the new system include: excellence in the standard
                of education available to all; equality of opportunity; parity
                of esteem for academic and vocational training; structures to
                encourage the development of all students’ full potential;
                parental and student choice; and the involvement of individuals
                in decisions that will affect them. Students should not have
                their life choices restricted before it is necessary to do so.
                Therefore, flexibility is required to cater for different rates
                of development. We want to see social inclusion in the new
                system. Access to all levels of education should be open to
                everyone, irrespective of their social background. Equitable
                funding for all schools should take account of the imperative of
                targeting social need.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The review body’s work must be seen in
                context, and the ongoing curriculum review has obvious
                significance. Recent years have seen the introduction of more
                vocational subjects in schools. It is hoped that an end to
                selection can contribute positively towards the creation of a
                more balanced primary curriculum, ending the unhealthy practice
                of &quot;teaching to the test&quot;. It should make room for a
                more flexible system in which children might explore a range of
                interests, combining the so-called academic subjects with the
                vocational, leaving career options open for as long as possible
                and encouraging better motivation through wider choices.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Change must be managed effectively in order
                to minimise disruption to students during the process. Teachers
                should have maximum input and protection during such upheaval.
                The implementation of reform should be undertaken in a
                manageable fashion in consultation with the teaching profession,
                taking full account of the additional workload involved in
                implementing any new arrangements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any transition should be properly funded. It
                is vital that parents have an opportunity to discuss the impact
                of options for change and that they should be kept fully
                informed as reforms are implemented.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I add my thanks to all those involved in the
                production of the report, as the Chairperson of the Committee
                has already done.</p>

                I endorse and broadly welcome the extensive report. It should
                receive a wider audience and not only be read by the members of
                the Committee for Education. Although it precedes the findings
                of the Burns review, it will make a significant impact
                nonetheless. The Committee underwent many rigours to get the
                report to this point. I add my thanks to everyone involved in
                its delivery.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the Chairperson’s comments about
                north Belfast and the protests outside the school. Those
                protests should not be going on and children should be allowed
                to attend their school. Children have a tremendous affinity with
                their school and their teachers.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. It is
                clear that we discussing post-primary education, not primary
                education. I ask you to make people stick to the subject.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hutchinson, you are correct. However, as
                Mr Kennedy referred to the matter, I thought it improper to
                interfere.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McHugh:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A LeasCheann Comhairle, post-primary and
                primary education cannot be separated nor dispensed with. The
                subject must be discussed in the round. The Chairperson referred
                to those issues, and it is right and proper that I also refer to
                them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee’s report contains much
                detail. The current selection system has been in place since the
                1940s. It catered for the situation pertaining at the time but
                which has now become outdated. The selection system was meant to
                separate people for leadership roles or professions; the rest
                would be employed in manual work. We have moved on since then,
                and the selection process is now seen as divisive. People are
                being typecast, and there is a stigma and an exclusive nature
                attached to the selection procedure and the schools involved.
                The percentage of children who are deemed to be failures at age
                11 is something that few people now support. Much of the
                evidence that we heard points to widespread dissatisfaction
                among parents, teachers and the public with the present system.
                Changes are needed. Much of the Committee’s response agrees
                with that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Various attitudes for and against vocational
                and academic pathways were expressed. We have three options: we
                can reform, or tinker, with the present selection system; we can
                abolish it; or we can retain the status quo. However, the final
                one is not really an option.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Burns review, the review of the
                curriculum and the local management of schools (LMS) review will
                be parts of an essential process. Many people would say that the
                past was well served by the selection procedure. I disagree, as
                would many others. The expectation then was that pupils would
                leave school at 16 and gain employment in agriculture, textiles
                or other industries.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The percentage of people that the system was
                meant to cater for has changed since its inception, and that
                must be taken into account.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have a high-tech, global economy, and more
                opportunities exist in the changing world of business. Jobs are
                higher paid, especially vocational ones, and pay is closely
                connected with knowledge. Education continues through lifelong
                learning of skills. People no longer leave school and stop
                learning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee’s approach to the evidence
                and the inquiry was one of consultation. All those who were
                involved — teachers, employers’ organisations, academics and
                schools — have already been mentioned. The Committee carried
                out some benchmarking by travelling to Scotland and to Hamburg
                and Munich in Germany. The Scottish system seems to be closer to
                what we need than the systems that exist in England and Wales.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The strengths of the inquiry have been
                mentioned, but one of its failings is that it did not extend its
                benchmarking process by examining the system in the Twenty-Six
                Counties. We require a vocational education system that is close
                to its system, and it could have provided a more valuable
                knowledge base than the systems in Scotland and Germany. The
                Committee failed to look at that system this time, but there is
                no reason for not doing so in future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report mentions the strengths of the
                current system — the number of pupils who attain five GCSEs at
                grades A to C and the standard of excellence achieved by grammar
                schools. However, those are achieved at great cost and at the
                expense of secondary schools.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Supporters of the current system often point
                to the academic results that are achieved by grammar schools.
                School performance data, which are gathered by the Department
                each year, provide comfort for those who wish to retain the
                current system. Almost 95% of year 12 grammar school students
                achieve five or more GCSE passes at grades at A to C, which is
                the standard performance indicator. During the academic year
                1997-98, those commendable results were achieved at a cost. The
                downside of the two-track educational system is illustrated when
                one compares grammar schools’ achievements with those of
                secondary schools in which only around 31% of year 12 students
                achieve five or more GCSE passes at grades A to C.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another problem, which illustrates the
                negative effects of selection on those who are deemed failures
                at the age of 11 is the relatively high proportion of pupils who
                leave school with no GCSE passes or equivalent qualifications.
                The Gallagher report pointed out that almost 22% of the North’s
                school leavers in 1986-87 had no qualifications compared with
                9·6% in England and 16% in Wales. The Northern Ireland Economic
                Council states that selection can be criticised for</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the apparent polarisation in attainment
                between grammar and secondary school leavers. This may occur as
                a result of the demotivation of students who are assessed as
                academically less able, and because more able students, whose
                presence may help to raise the attainment of less able groups,
                are educated separately&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recent research on the North’s education
                system raises doubts about whether it is possible to
                substantially raise the standards of secondary school students
                under the present system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Grammar schools have many powerful supporters
                who are often products of a grammar school education. A high
                proportion of parents opt for their children to undergo the
                selection process. It could be argued that the overwhelming
                majority of parents recognise, at least in academic terms, the
                benefits of grammar school education. However, the selection
                test is, in fact, a deselection test, as 60% of children fail to
                obtain grammar school places. A parental decision to put a child
                through the transfer test may be as much a choice for the
                grammar schools as a choice against the perceived shortcomings
                of secondary schools. Selection by socio-economic background,
                often referred to as selection by mortgage, is as bad as
                selection by tests at 11 years old.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The current selection system was built on
                several assumptions that no longer apply. The labour market
                needs a highly differentiated workforce. At present, most manual
                labour is performed by machines, which people must learn to
                monitor and programme. Today’s workforce needs a better
                overall education, and it must learn to adapt, understand and
                effect change by social and technological means.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Society can only afford to pay the high
                educational costs of an elite group. That should be intolerable
                in a democracy. It is possible to identify, accurately and
                early, those with superior intellectual skills. The old 11-plus
                test was based on a measure of IQ, which itself was supported by
                flawed research. Prof John Gardiner of Queen’s University
                showed how inaccurate the 11-plus test is, with as little as 18
                marks out of a possible 150 separating grades A to D. New
                theories of intelligence ascribe many different components to
                intelligence — not only the ability to perform well in a
                written exam. It is now accepted that children develop in spurts
                and not in a linear or even fashion, and that development is
                subject to influence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was difficult to ascertain which Committee
                members were in favour of keeping selection and those who wished
                to move away from it. I am glad that the SDLP is in favour of
                11-to-18, all-ability education, which my party supports. That
                is the way forward, with pupils from all levels supporting and
                helping each other to gain an overall higher level of
                achievement for the school. That would make more of a difference
                than to take away the cream of some schools and leave those less
                able or less well off together in a particular school. That
                lowers the levels of achievement and makes it more difficult for
                those schools to aspire to high levels of achievement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am happy that the report’s
                recommendations are fairly even-handed, although I cannot agree
                with some of them. The Committee Chairperson said that changes
                should be phased in. Changes could be phased in over 10 years,
                depending on the approach. We do not want to do that. The
                essential change should be introduced immediately. Industry and
                others must have something of which they are sure. Schools and
                pupils must know what will be in place in three to five years’
                time. Pupils, teachers and parents want it sorted out in two to
                four years, rather let it drag on indefinitely with different
                levels of support.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with other recommendations. There is
                no problem with parity of esteem. There is said to be perceived
                underachievement, but there is underachievement — it is not
                perceived — in some schools. Many pupils leave school without
                achieving anything, which leads to tremendous problems in later
                life. I recommend Members to read the five volumes attached to
                the report. What the Committee is trying to do is commendable,
                and I hope that one day there will be 11-to-18, all- ability
                schools. Vocational education has not had the recognition that
                it deserves. Society must deal with that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main purpose of the review is to maximise
                potential in education for everyone.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I add my thanks in acknowledging the work of
                my Committee colleagues, the Chairperson, the Clerk, the
                assistants, the Assembly researchers and the specialist adviser.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The considerable volume of oral evidence and
                written submissions in the Committee’s work on the report
                clearly demonstrates the interest and concern of all in
                education. Our general conclusion was that it is essential that
                future structures be efficient and effective.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee visited Scotland and Germany,
                and the overall message from all our considerations was that any
                future system of post-primary education must be flexible and
                cater as far as possible for the needs of every child. The age
                range must be less restrictive yet challenging. I hope that the
                outline of key components and the key values of equality,
                inclusivity and flexibility proposed in the report will be
                seriously considered in the Burns report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We wish parents to have a better and more
                informed input in their children’s choices. Teachers must also
                be involved, so that a realistic curriculum and choice of
                subjects will be offered to pupils at this important time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report states that</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The high educational standards which
                have been achieved in Northern Ireland over the years must be
                maintained whilst vigorous action must be taken to tackle the
                perceived ‘tail of underachievement’; any changes introduced
                must recognise and build upon the strengths of the current
                system.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should not throw the baby out with the
                bath water. The Committee did look into that issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Such a system would negate the stress and
                tension felt by all in the present system who must make a choice
                at 11-plus age. I will not go into that system’s
                disadvantages. We need to be constructive and progressive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The bottom line was to ensure that children
                had the opportunity to develop their potential to the full —
                intellectually, physically, spiritually, socially and
                creatively. The Alliance Party would certainly concur. We do
                not, as people may say, advocate the complete abolition of
                grammar schools. However, there should be viable alternatives,
                so that all children with differing abilities can enter a secure
                and confident future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From personal and party experience, and from
                our Committee work on the report, I know that the present system
                does not work. Rather, it disadvantages the majority of our
                young people. As a direct result, many have faced adulthood with
                little or no incentive or ambition. We hope that the report’s
                recommendations go some way to improving that situation. A good
                working relationship between schools, higher education
                institutes, industry and commerce will provide ample opportunity
                for each pupil to fulfil his or her own ideas of development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Alliance Party promotes the point that
                the review body will look at the lessons learnt in the
                all-ability integrated education sector. The positive elements
                of the current system have been coupled with a realistic
                structure that will serve all our people well. In doing so, the
                system will not only benefit pupils, but the whole of Northern
                Ireland in the long run.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the Assembly accepts this
                cross-party, consensual report, and that the Burns review body
                will adopt it as an integral part of its own report.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the report, but some of its
                recommendations must be examined. The report is vague; it is a
                non- prescriptive picture of an ideal education system. We need
                more than that. There was no recognition of the value of the
                Youth Service, and there was no suggestion that the Youth
                Service and the formal education system could be linked. We talk
                continually about the problem of low achievement, but we will
                not recognise that the Youth Service can do something about it.
                There is a need to harmonise the Youth Service with the formal
                education sector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Everyone knows that &quot;choice&quot; is a
                weasel word. Nobody really has choice in the education system.
                Our key objective must be to consider how we can provide it. I
                am concerned at the idea that guidance by teachers will enhance
                pupils’ choices. There are several things wrong with that.
                First, teachers may not want to move into that field. Secondly,
                trade unions would be concerned about it. Thirdly, what do we do
                if a teacher makes the wrong choice or gives the wrong
                information?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Underachievement begins at pre-school age. We
                talk continually about the problems in post-primary education,
                but they exist because nothing is done earlier. There are
                examples of how schools have tried to alleviate those problems.
                Several schools in the Greater Shankill area decided to do away
                with the curriculum for primary 1 and use the Scandinavian
                model. However, it will take a while for the results of that to
                be seen. We cannot tackle underachievement only in so-called
                sink schools. We must tackle the problem before children go to
                primary school.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is too late to tackle underachievement at
                the post- primary stage. It must be done earlier. Secondary
                school teachers believe that they do not get the finished
                product. They get a child who, at the age of 11, has the reading
                ability of a nine-year-old. Primary school principals tell us
                that children from nursery school are not ready to go to school
                and are not ready to learn. Unless we listen to those views and
                develop a system that will get children ready for school, we
                will not get to the nub of the problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to teaching staff, the report
                states that the value of teachers should be recognised. We
                should, however, also recognise the failures of teachers. We
                should look at how we can develop a fast track to get failing
                teachers out of the system. That will cost money, but it must be
                done. Most MLAs, and anyone who has ever been on a board of
                governors, will recognise that there are failing teachers and
                that something must be done about that. Is the money there to do
                that?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I decided not to move my recent motion on the
                threshold assessment because the Minister was not available.
                That was unfortunate, but I recognised the reasons why he was
                not here. The threshold assessment in Northern Ireland does not
                set a positive tone. It discriminates against young teachers, as
                well as against principals. We must correct that situation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recommendation 6.2.3 implies that a transfer
                profile will measure only what the child can do. If that is the
                case, how will we measure, for example, a child with a swimming
                commendation against a child who is an Irish dancing champion?
                How can we ensure equality? We cannot say that one is less
                valuable than the other. Who will decide which is most valuable?
                We must address such issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree that the vocational curriculum should
                be regarded as having the same worth as the academic curriculum.
                However, it is difficult to convince parents of that. How do we
                persuade parents of the value of a vocational course for their
                child? People have suggested the establishment of centres of
                excellence. That is probably the way in which we will go
                forward. Students will move around a campus. They will go to it
                because it is good for sport or information technology, for
                example.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a lovely word in all of this —
                &quot;creativity&quot;. It is lovely no matter what it is
                applied to. It can be applied to anything — even to sport,
                whether football or any other sport. However, I have always
                found the word hard to define. I would like the Education
                Committee to define that word. Perhaps the Committee will be
                able to do that as matters unfold.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We await the outcome of the Burns review body
                on Wednesday, and that needs to be borne in mind during today’s
                debate. It might have been better to discuss both reports
                together. Nonetheless, it is good to see the cross-community
                work of the Committee. I am not a member of the Education
                Committee, but I realise that it must have taken a lot of work
                to reach agreement on some of the recommendations. However,
                having gone through the review process, it would have been
                surprising if we had not heard some of the recommendations that
                have come forward, such as the abolition of the transfer test.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is good to see recommendation 6.1.9, which
                emphasises that any changes should not encourage the development
                of a sizeable independent sector. That was a major concern
                during the discussions about the review. We must be careful that
                the conclusions in the Burns review body report do not lead to
                an increase in the independent sector, with people opting out.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the first time, Northern Ireland has an
                opportunity to tackle the education system, particularly as we
                now know what is needed with regard to the curriculum. We are
                talking about devising a system that is moving towards the year
                2020. An overhaul of the education system is needed — we are
                not tinkering with the margins any more. Prof Gallagher, in his
                report, referred constantly to the long tail of
                underachievement. The only way to tackle that is to overhaul the
                system. It is good that we now have the opportunity to do that.
                Unless we examine the structure of the current system and
                attempt to make some major structural changes, we will miss this
                opportunity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The huge need for an inclusive, comprehensive
                and integrated system was put on the record in an earlier debate
                in the Chamber. I am delighted by the Northern Eastern Education
                and Library Board’s thoughtful submission to the Committee,
                detailed in volume 3 of the report. The board wanted matters put
                on record, and today is a good opportunity to do so. Paragraph
                7.7 on page 102 states:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Board would also place on record
                the opportunity afforded by the present Review to undertake a
                strategic and radical examination of educational provision
                throughout the province. The opportunity exists in consultation
                with other providers to create a system which meets the needs of
                a pluralist society through the establishment of a genuinely
                comprehensive and inclusive education system, an opportunity
                which may not arise again for many decades.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report goes on:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Board would ask decision-makers to
                give this matter serious consideration if it is proposed to
                undertake a radical review of existing provision. Such a model
                would have much to commend it in terms of contributing to an
                inclusive society and it is the model that would make most
                effective use of resources.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The board then makes a very interesting
                point:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;A starting point could be to have a
                fully integrated, non segregated schooling system for 16-18 year
                olds.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clearly that type of system exists at age 18.
                Students progress to a fully integrated, non-segregated system
                of further and higher education. The board sees such a system as
                a starting point.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I take the point that there are different
                interpretations of the timescale of phases. However, it seems
                realistic to suggest that changes should be implemented within
                two or three years of the Burns review body’s report being
                published. If changes are made, we must have a huge campaign of
                education and raising awareness among parents about what those
                changes will entail. Scotland made changes and did not look
                back. I understand that more Scottish children, right across
                society, are going to universities as a consequence of the
                creation of a pluralist and comprehensive system of education.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The system here is not working at the moment.
                As was stated by Prof Gallagher and others the assessment tail
                is wagging the curriculum dog. It should not be that way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McHugh mentioned John Gardiner’s
                research into multiple intelligences, which are not taken
                account of in the transfer test. It will be interesting to see
                what replaces the transfer test. I was a teacher for many years.
                Higher education moved away from tests at the end of final year
                towards a system of accreditation over three years. The system
                of course assessments and inbuilt work with the students to
                improve their performance was a system that the students much
                preferred, rather than a test at a particular time that was
                based more on memory than on knowledge. That is the test that
                will be set now as we move forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was concerned about the recommendations on
                the curriculum in the report. The Council for the Curriculum,
                Examinations and Assessment is undertaking a curriculum review,
                and it will be interesting to see the outcome of that.
                Recommendation 6.3.2 mentions the type of curriculum that could
                be followed up to the age of 13 or 14. It specifies that it
                would probably include, but not be confined to:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;English, Mathematics, Sciences, at
                least one additional Language, Humanities, Personal Development,
                Physical Education and ICT.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the criticisms that came from schools,
                and from many principals, was that education should be an
                enjoyable experience. I have children, and I know that one of
                the subjects that they most enjoy is drama. It is sad to see
                that it is not highlighted. Billy Hutchinson referred to
                creativity. Children often find themselves confined in
                classrooms at a very early age, particularly in this country
                where, at the age of four, they start in huge classes of 30
                pupils. They rarely have the opportunity to be creative
                themselves. Since most of the post-primary principals pointed
                out that learning should be enjoyable, it seems rather
                disappointing that we have not included subjects such as music
                and drama — indeed, the arts as we know it. Over and over
                again the criticism is made that these are the first subjects to
                be cut when we curtail the curriculum. I am a little concerned
                that they have been narrowed — indeed, those subjects seem to
                have disappeared from the recommendations.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is good to see that the report flags up
                exploration of collaborative arrangements between schools. I
                certainly hope that we do not follow the line that Billy
                Hutchinson took earlier as regards the creation of specialist
                schools. As a parent myself, I do not look forward to a future
                where I may be travelling huge distances between one school and
                another depending on my children’s specialities. I am sure
                that others in the Chamber will agree with me. It is possible
                for us to have inclusive schools, providing a broad curriculum
                up to 13 or 14 years of age. After that there may be
                specialities according to subject, but I certainly would not
                want to see sports cut out of a curriculum for those children
                doing academic or vocational subjects. That is why this
                recommendation is important. It suggests collaborative
                arrangements between schools and other institutions to create
                the mixes that students favour.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report also moots collaboration between
                further and higher education and schools, which is often missing
                at present. Last week we discussed the report from the Committee
                for Employment and Learning, which pointed out the need for
                universities and colleges in Northern Ireland to do more
                outreach work, particularly where they have an
                underrepresentation of students in higher and further education.
                That work needs to start if we are going to make changes. It is
                clear that, in the past, fewer students moved from secondary
                education into further and higher education, and this is an
                obvious opportunity to change that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the advantages of the Committee’s
                report was that it called on those giving evidence to carry out
                some work with young people. Again, Billy Hutchinson made the
                point that perhaps not enough evidence was taken from the Youth
                Service. I noted that the Belfast Education and Library Board
                did gather the views of the Youth Service. In a range of youth
                clubs, 1,131 young people in total were asked a range of
                questions about the current system. Eighty per cent answered
                that they would abolish the transfer test now; 8% said they
                would retain it; and 10% said they would retain it, but for
                older children. It was interesting to hear what a sample of over
                1,000young people had to say about the system. Indeed, the young
                citizens’ jury was an interesting way of gathering evidence.
                We have clearly engaged young people in Northern Ireland and
                gathered their views. It was interesting to find some of this
                evidence in the generous appendices to the report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, it is wonderful for all of us
                to say that we were part of this debate. Clearly, major changes
                will now be made, but the most important thing is to include
                teachers in these changes. At present they seem to be
                exceptionally demoralised by the wait for change, particularly
                in the light of current community relations’ difficulties. I
                am concerned that we are not in a position to provide the kind
                of safety and security that children have a right to, both
                outside and inside the school. That point is missing from this
                report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We talk about education for the new economic
                society. We talk about it as regards ethos and values, but
                education in a peaceful and stable society is one of the most
                important parts of a values system. However, the report does not
                concentrate on that point to any great extent. It makes no
                recommendations on the future of pupils with emotional or
                behavioural difficulties, something that teachers see as one of
                the major issues they have to deal with.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad that many of the schools set aside
                for children who were rejected by mainstream schools have been
                evaluated. If we are to continue to nurture children,
                particularly those with emotional or behavioural difficulties,
                we have to address that matter in any new education structure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue of teacher training must be
                addressed if the school system and the curriculum are to be
                restructured. What will happen to that, given the segregated
                nature of teacher training in Northern Ireland?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">More research must be done in Northern
                Ireland in order to achieve the correct social mix. More
                collaborative arrangements must be put in place so that children
                can be educated together. Whilst we desperately need to start
                that now, we need to manage, plan and resource the change well.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr K Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the fact that the report has been
                brought to the Assembly for consideration. It is a weighty
                report, and it is the result of many hours of intensive
                Committee meetings, written submissions, focus group briefings,
                field visits and commissioned research.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the key witnesses, including the main
                education bodies, teacher and employer organisations, and
                interested bodies, who added a new dimension of analysis to our
                deliberations and discussions and aided the Committee in its
                quest for clarity. Furthermore, I acknowledge the hard work of
                the Committee Clerks, the members and the Chairperson, Mr Danny
                Kennedy, who treated the review with the sensitivity and
                professionalism it deserves.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been said that it is more than 50
                years since the education acts of 1944 and 1947 came into force.
                The fact that so many facets remain central to our present
                system is a testimony to the vision of the architects of that
                legislation. However, it is obvious that the ever- increasing
                demands of a fast-moving modern society are not being fully met
                by the bolt-on and ill-considered solutions that epitomised the
                era of direct rule.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report’s findings and recommendations
                are based on an honest attempt by parties holding different
                views to find a common focus through which they can address the
                challenges of the new century. The Committee did not want to
                replicate the review body on post-primary education’s
                consultation exercise, but it believed that it had a
                responsibility to give the fundamental issues the due time and
                consideration they deserve.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many of the report’s conclusions and
                recommendations are worthy of further and detailed
                consideration. The recommendations are not intended to be a
                blueprint for the future structure of our education system.
                However, they include several key principles that must underpin
                any educational developments in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These key principles and recommendations sit
                very comfortably with the Ulster Unionist Party’s response to
                the review on post-primary education entitled ‘Excellence,
                Diversity and Choice’, which was published early in the year.
                The document contained the main educational concerns and
                aspirations of the community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I draw Members’ attention to the Committee
                report’s findings in three major areas. First, whether one
                likes it or not, the much maligned transfer procedure has been
                central to the current dissatisfaction. The Committee’s
                recommendation to the Council for the Curriculum, Examinations
                and Assessment (CCEA) that it should undertake improvements in a
                limited timescale is to be welcomed as an interim response. We
                have heard about the difficulties with timetables and the
                definition between current grades. Those areas need to be dealt
                with immediately.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the longer term, which the Committee has
                defined as in the next three years — it has wisely designed a
                timescale — there should be a transfer profile incorporating
                current pupil performance, pupil development over a period of
                time, parental wishes and, despite Billy Hutchinson’s
                recommendations, professional teacher guidance. All these must
                be fully discussed and tried. This approach appears to offer a
                more equitable and acceptable way forward than anything that we
                have had heretofore.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, the curriculum needs to change as
                part of any review of the post-primary education system. The
                recommendation of a core curriculum offered to all pupils up to
                the age of 14 has much to commend it as it would allow
                flexibility and enable pupils to sample a range of subjects
                before making choices which would reflect academic, technical
                and vocational strands. The rigid current &quot;in school&quot;
                approach should be replaced by a collaborative arrangement with
                other institutions to better advise potential choices by pupils.
                The Ulster Unionist Party looks forward to further debates
                centred upon that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, the principles that form the basis
                for the future education system must focus on the requirements
                of that system. Those referred to in paragraphs 6.1.1 to 6.1.9
                of the report deserve careful consideration and should form the
                basis for discussion. My party regards several factors as
                critical to achieving educational excellence, and perhaps more
                than anything else the quality and commitment of our teaching
                staff are critical to that. We are fortunate to have a wealth of
                first-class teachers, and we are proud, as the entire House
                should be, of what has been achieved in the majority of schools.
                Yet we are not complacent; there is a clear need for
                improvement. Change must enable young people to maximise their
                potential and to ensure that we must retain what is best in the
                current system and allow no dilution of our renowned academic
                results.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Apart from the Army, education is the only
                organisation that conscripts its participants. This report
                signals a move away from conscription and curricular
                prescription toward choice — individual choice, parental
                choice, a choice of routes, the choice to switch between routes,
                to mix and match to reflect an individual’s interests, skills
                and personal objectives. That alone would release much untapped
                educational energy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Disaffected post-primary pupils play a large
                part in the tribulations of many secondary schools and feed the
                perceptions that make that type of education unattractive to
                certain echelons in society. They will be challenged as never
                before to become active participants in a meaningful educational
                experience. That segment of the school population largely
                contributes to our having only half the level of qualification
                levels of our major European competitors. It represents a
                sizeable slice of that 25% of the underperforming tail that we
                hear so much about.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My party feels that paragraphs 6.3.1 to
                6.3.11 offer society an opportunity to address these problems in
                a structured way that will replace the &quot;Band-Aid&quot;
                approach that currently seeks to address underachievement and
                disaffection. I want to touch briefly on this. The nature and
                content of the curriculum are key. The core curriculum on offer
                up to 14 years of age should include English, maths, sciences,
                language, personal development, physical education, information
                and communications technology and the flexibility to meet
                individual needs and circumstances. Perhaps this is how to meet
                the creativity concerns of Billy Hutchinson and the other areas
                that were referred to by Monica McWilliams. There is no
                intention to exclude any of those aspects of education. It would
                not be a full education if they were excluded.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An opportunity to sample a range of subjects
                before deciding on choices is crucial to this change.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How many of us know of glaring examples of
                people locked into courses and systems that allow no flexibility
                and that cause them to drop out and fail to maximise their
                potential?</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A relevant and broad skills-based curriculum
                should be encouraged as part of the Northern Ireland Council for
                the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment’s (CCEA) ongoing
                review. That must stretch and challenge pupils to maximise their
                potential. We do not want the lowest common denominator of a
                curriculum: it must stretch pupils right across the board.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A formal mechanism by which business and
                industry can inform curriculum developers and managers about
                changing skill requirements is long overdue. However, the fact
                that the Committee has referred to it is a welcome innovation
                that must be pursued quickly. Many Members have mentioned
                collaboration with other institutions. An opportunity now exists
                to develop natural integration among nearby institutions that
                might previously have interacted only with other establishments
                in their specific sector of education. That would have the
                potential to offer even wider curricular choices at certain
                localities and might be especially attractive in some rural
                settings. That would present a further opportunity to develop
                the cross-community contact that occurs naturally in further and
                higher education institutions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are acutely aware of the considerable
                implications for teacher training and in-service training
                provision, which include staffing, funding and course content.
                Those must be addressed as early as possible if the new
                programmes of study are to be in place ahead of any proposed
                changes. Many of the disasters of previous educational changes
                can be put down to the fact that they were ill-considered and
                ill-planned; we were always playing catch-up with teacher
                training, resources and persuading people that a project was
                worthy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Education, as has been said, is a partnership
                of pupils, parents and teachers, and any change must enlist the
                active support of all three groups. The period after the
                Committee’s report and the findings of the Burns review, which
                is imminent, should be used to explain and explore the
                recommendations contained in both. I hope that, on the basis of
                those recommendations, we can move away from the emotional
                responses of recent times and enter an era informed by reasoned
                debate that will lead to rational solutions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, in supporting the report, my party
                is conscious that it will not embark on an exercise in social
                engineering. Rather, it will enter wholeheartedly into a genuine
                attempt to ensure equality of access, provision and opportunity
                to maximise the skills and talents of individuals, not as
                members of any class or tribe, but for the benefit of
                individuals and society at large.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gallagher:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My party has consistently opposed the present
                arrangements on the grounds that there have been far too many
                injustices and inequalities in the system. I welcome the report
                because it will help to promote debate, not so much on the
                injustices of the system, of which everyone is aware, but about
                how we change that system. It is clear that we need to replace
                the present system with a better one. We have very high
                standards in many schools, which nobody can overlook. Rather
                than dismantle the present system, a sound education system for
                the future should be based on an evolving version of it. That
                would be in the best interests of all children and all sectors.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the report’s recommendation is that
                the current tests should cease as soon as possible. Members may
                be aware that questions are being asked about when the tests
                will come to an end. Many people want to know what circumstances
                will prevail at the time of transfer for children who are now
                eight, nine and ten years old.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There have been suggestions that the CCEA
                should introduce some improvements while we are in a period of
                change. Nobody would disagree with that. However, I want to
                sound a note of caution. In the past, so-called improvements
                were introduced which many educationalists would argue, served
                only to make the operation of the system worse than it had been.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One suggestion that enjoys some currency at
                the moment is that the tests should be moved back into the
                second term of the school year; they currently take place around
                eight weeks into the first term. To move the tests further into
                the school year would prolong the agony for children, teachers
                and parents. I welcome suggestions to improve the tests, but we
                should hear about them before they are introduced. They should
                be debated, and the teaching profession should be consulted in
                detail.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report contains several recommendations
                on changing the system. Those recommendations will help to
                promote a challenging debate on why changes are needed, and on
                what kind of system is needed to prepare young people for the
                future and for earning a living in the twenty-first century. It
                is important that education prepares young people to contribute
                to the local economy and enables them to compete in the global
                economy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report refers to the fact that, under the
                present arrangements, too many children’s curriculum
                experiences are limited. That is especially true for those from
                socially-deprived backgrounds. As I said at the outset, high
                standards across the education spectrum are important. However,
                we must look at what we are preparing children for. In a modern
                society, everyone must have ample opportunity to acquire a range
                of skills, be they basic skills, key skills, communication
                skills, literacy and numeracy skills, or information and
                communication technology skills. In future, employees will need
                to be adaptable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many challenges lie ahead, but few are
                greater than devising a system in which academic education,
                although remaining important, is accorded equal status with
                vocational education. The report states that they should be
                accorded parity of esteem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report will assist the debate and
                discussion of the issues. I have mentioned some of the
                challenges, but a stark fact should be kept in mind as we look
                at the background against which we will be working. There are
                133,000 students in post-primary education today. In 25 years,
                that number will be reduced to 110,000. The scenario that we
                face will also test our imagination. To reiterate, if we adopt a
                method based on retaining all that is best and adapting what
                currently exists, rather than dismantling it, we shall be able
                to create a more useful and successful system that will include,
                where demand for it exists, local solutions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Local solutions operate in some parts of
                Northern Ireland; for example, in all-ability schools. I do not
                make claims about the merits of any of those — some seem to
                work well, and others need improvement. However, in our vision
                of the way forward, issues on which there is strong agreement
                between the governors, teachers and parents of every school in
                an area should not be ignored.</p>

                United, football was like geometry. It was very unattractive,
                because it was played within the tight parameters of
                parallelograms and triangles. The 11-plus and the education
                system have confined children and teachers to such narrow
                parameters as part of a thought-out process. That has denied
                them the opportunity to be creative, in the same way as
                footballers were restricted.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I meet many primary and secondary school
                teachers. At the moment, I have never met so many who are
                seeking early retirement. They want out because it is
                horrendous; it is difficult for them to express themselves in
                the system. Young, talented and able teachers, at primary and
                secondary level, are attempting to leave that system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fairness, social inclusivity, pluralism,
                equality and justice should underline our education system.
                Education is at the very foundation of our society. Cognisance
                should be taken from the fact that an education system is an
                integral part of our society and of the way that society
                develops.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not wish to make a political point, but
                in his book, ‘The Murder Machine’, Padraig Pearse described
                the education system as it existed throughout the island of
                Ireland before partition. It seems that children were put on a
                conveyor belt at one end and came out at the other stereotyped,
                stamped and left with no real creativity or personality, apart
                from the ability to get a job in the Civil Service or as a
                teacher. That was because the education system was geared to
                particular jobs and to the tailoring of children and people for
                those jobs. There was no notion that the purpose of education
                was not only to prepare children and adults for work, but to
                prepare them for life and for their role in society. That
                getting away from the personal notion of an educational system
                has contributed to the breakdown of the fabric of society.</p>

                fundamentals of education. However, it must examine education,
                root and branch, to see where it has gone wrong. It has gone

                opportunity and adhere to international standards of human
                rights. Those who advocate the retention of selection see its
                survival and its singularity as a positive feature of education
                in the North of Ireland. The implication is that there is some
                form of excellence or wisdom peculiar and particular to our
                system that is worth preserving. However, its demise or its
                non-existence elsewhere indicates the enlightenment of those
                jurisdictions in which non- selective systems have worked.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was surprised at Mr Gallagher’s remarks.
                He seemed to be singing from a different hymn sheet to that of
                Ms Lewsley and the rest of his party. He appeared to be
                formulating the adaptation, rather than the total elimination,
                of the 11-plus system. Mr Gallagher appears to be at odds with
                the SDLP on that issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All the appropriate points have already been
                made. An education system should provide all children with equal
                opportunities to develop at their own pace and to avail
                themselves of the greatest possible breadth of curriculum
                choices. It should promote equality of teaching and learning in
                all schools. In particular, pupils of different ages, academic
                abilities and social backgrounds would benefit from sharing the
                same learning environment, as would their teachers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The education system should recognise the
                full diversity of children’s needs and talents. Every child
                has a special need, which the present system ignores. Every
                school must endeavour to provide that space in which a child’s
                differing and changing needs can be met. As parents will tell
                you, the education system has failed to do that. It must be
                inclusive of all partners: parents, teachers, students, local
                communities, and the whole of society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sometimes politicians do not look much beyond
                the next election. That is particularly true when tackling the
                11-plus and other issues that affect the lives of constituents.
                Politicians try to be all things to all men — or women —
                without looking beyond that election and having some vision
                about the society that they are trying to create. Politicians
                must give the lead, particularly in such fundamental areas as
                health and, particularly, education. Politicians should give the
                lead to ensure that we provide a system of education that is
                fair and that provides social inclusivity, pluralism, equality
                and justice.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hamilton:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Kennedy referred to the debate as being
                one of the most important that the Assembly has so far
                undertaken. He is correct. With that in mind, I wish to register
                a great deal of disappointment that once again the DUP Members
                have absented themselves. They are doing the children of
                Northern Ireland no favours by engaging in the type of political
                stunt that we witnessed this morning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the main reasons that I so readily
                endorse the report is that it so closely mirrors my party’s
                submission to the Burns review of post-primary education. The
                key elements of my party’s submission — excellence,
                diversity and choice — underpin the report. Both papers
                reflect the need to preserve all that is good in our current
                system, including those elements that have, across the years,
                resulted in Northern Ireland producing a consistently higher
                success rate than elsewhere in the United Kingdom. That fact is
                borne out on page 10 of the report, in which reference is made
                to the increased levels of participation in higher education by
                young people from traditional working-class backgrounds in
                comparison to their counterparts in England, Scotland and Wales.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is an equal need to address those areas
                in which improvement may be made. To strive for an educational
                system that provides excellence for all is remarkable, as is the
                inclusion of sections that deal with parity of esteem, parental
                choice coupled with professional guidance from teachers,
                flexibility in the curriculum, and the requirement for children
                to be able to transfer more easily between different sectors in
                the post-primary system. All those essentials of my party’s
                submission are addressed and reflected throughout the Committee
                for Education’s recommendations, and I welcome that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Coming in advance of the Burns report, it is
                right and fitting that the Assembly’s Committee for Education
                should not be taking a hard or fast stand on the issues that
                surround the transfer procedure. Instead, it recommends the
                adoption of a series of principles and required outcomes against
                which the Burns report can be judged and appraised. In
                particular, I am pleased to note that the Committee, although
                suggesting its possible combination with other assessment
                methods, is not ruling out the idea of continuing to use some
                method of final standardised central testing. That is important.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many in the House advocate continuous
                assessment. As a teacher, I can tell you that those results are
                by no means foolproof, any more than is the result of a transfer
                test. The results of continuous assessment can be backed up by
                the results of a final standardised test. Similarly, continuous
                assessment can be used as a method to validate the result of the
                standardised test. One can therefore act as a back up to the
                other. If that system were adopted, it would be a more reliable
                indicator than reliance on just the one method.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are other reasons why I hold those
                views. However, to be honest, it would take about an hour and a
                half to explain them. Not even your patience, Mr Deputy Speaker,
                never mind that of the other Members, would stretch that far.
                Whatever outcome is adopted to decide the issue of transfer into
                post-primary education, I welcome the recommendation that it be
                phased in over time, and that it be properly trialled and
                tested. I taught for 25 years, and in that time I experienced
                attempts at educational reform under direct rule.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The method used was to create the reforms
                before starting to train the teachers to carry them out. That
                often resulted in little more than a shambles; after training,
                teachers would often attempt to implement new methods, only to
                have their instructions altered because they had proved
                ineffective. As a result of that, teachers often had to make
                massive alterations, at an advanced stage of a course, which
                caused considerable disruption not only to themselves, but, more
                importantly, to the education of their pupils.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a widespread acceptance that the
                present transfer arrangements are unsatisfactory and in need of
                alteration. The Assembly must get it right, so the changes,
                which will come, will work in practice when they are
                implemented. Trials, along with a phased and considered plan of
                implementation, will help to achieve that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My party and I wish to see a transfer
                procedure in Northern Ireland that opens up opportunities,
                rather than closes them down. Such systems exist in other
                countries, and there is no reason why they cannot exist in
                Northern Ireland. The Committee for Education’s report brings
                that possibility closer, and I urge Members to support it.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Fee:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend the report to the Assembly. I
                missed some of the debate, because, I must confess, I am one of
                the Members who metaphorically &quot;jukes behind the bicycle
                sheds&quot; from time to time. However, I understood the drift
                of the debate and will try not to repeat points already made.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We were in fraught and emotional
                circumstances 18 months ago. Many Members will have attended
                public meetings at which one section of parents and teachers was
                demanding that the 11-plus go. There were raw, emotional debates
                about the effect of the transfer test system on young children.
                That forthright campaign led to another and equally forthright
                crusade that was spurred on by a fear on the part of many
                educators and boards of governors that we would rush to destroy
                the best of education in Northern Ireland or that we would act
                rashly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report demonstrates that, in that
                emotion- charged debate, we have been able to marshall rational
                arguments by and on behalf of parents, teachers, pupils, boards
                of governors, those transferring and others to produce a
                coherent and rational set of recommendations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The three reviews that are currently under
                way — the formula-funding review, the curriculum review and
                the review of post-primary education — constitute the most
                fundamental analysis of the education system in Northern
                Ireland. For the first time in over 50 years the selection
                procedure has been examined. It is the first time that anyone in
                Northern Ireland has been properly consulted about the impact of
                the Education Reform (Northern Ireland) Order 1989. When Brian
                Mawhinney introduced the Education Reform Act 1988, followed by
                the 1989 Order, every educational union, major church, political
                party and parents’ group in Northern Ireland opposed it. We
                are now giving those people their first say on how education
                should be run and administered here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At one point, many believed that the debate
                would deteriorate into a situation of grammar schools versus
                secondary schools, church versus state, one sector versus
                another, and, in many cases, one parent against another.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we have learnt no other lesson, we have
                learnt that we can take on the most contentious issues, that we
                can provide a consultation exercise that is broadly engaged by
                the entire community and that the Assembly is a forum that can
                generate that type of political development.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Sir John Gorman] in the
                Chair)</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to highlight one or two of the
                report’s recommendations. First, the education system must:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;offer pupils the opportunity to develop
                to their fullest potential — intellectually, physically,
                spiritually, socially and creatively&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The system must be:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;conscious of the particular needs,
                experiences and aspirations of all young people of varying
                socio-economic, religious and cultural backgrounds&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That says clearly that any new system must be
                based entirely on the needs of the individual child, and, as far
                as is possible, it must be customised for the child. That
                important statement must be highlighted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, recommendation 6.1.2 says that:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Any reforms to the current education
                system should be phased in over a period of time and should
                involve key groups — teachers, Governors, parents, pupils and
                other interested bodies and groups.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the biggest grievances of the last 20
                or 30 years is that the educators — those delivering the
                service to our children — have been the last people to be
                consulted, trained, given resources and tooled up for the job.
                With this report, we are committing ourselves to a process that
                is inclusive and that goes at a pace that allows everyone to
                keep up.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third great fear that was generated at
                the beginning of this debate was that there was some sort of
                tacit conspiracy to do away with grammar schools or to diminish
                the high standards of education that have been achieved in
                Northern Ireland. The report clearly states that those standards
                must be maintained, while vigorous action must be taken to
                tackle the perceived tail of underachievement. It could not be
                more explicit. We want to improve what exists, not destroy it.
                We want to expand accessibility to the best education to all
                children and not, in any sense, inhibit the high achievers in
                our society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In case there is any misunderstanding — Mr
                John Kelly seems to have left the room, but I am sure his
                Colleague will pass this on — Members should read my lips: the
                11-plus must go. That is, has been and will remain the SDLP’s
                policy, and it is the policy of most of the parties in the
                Assembly. However, that is the easy bit. The hard bit is
                contained in the report — and, presumably, it will be in the
                report of the Burns review, which will be published this week
                — which is how to create a better system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report is very clear. Paragraph 6.2.2
                says that:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The current tests should cease to be
                administered from such future date as is feasible to
                implement.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The 11-plus must go; it is as simple as that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend to the Assembly one other item from
                the report that has not been discussed in any detail. A transfer
                profile should be created for each child so that every aspect of
                the child’s potential can be measured over a sustained period,
                with input coming not only from tests but also from continuous
                assessment. Assessment should not be carried out through a
                two-hour snapshot of how the child performs. It should take into
                account how a child develops and performs over a long time.
                Input should be given by teachers, school administrators and
                parents. That would be an enormous, radical stride forward for
                our education system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately the Minister is not present,
                but we recognise that, some time ago, he committed himself to
                doing away with the current selection procedure, and we welcome
                that. By presenting this report, we are providing him with the
                political climate in which he can say that there is widespread
                support for fundamental reform. I ask him to get on with it as
                quickly as possible.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Neeson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to make a brief contribution to this
                important debate. As a former teacher, I have a great deal of
                interest in the subject. The Education (Northern Ireland) Act
                1947 was an important Act of its time and provided the
                opportunity for many people, particularly from working-class
                backgrounds, to avail of the benefits of a grammar-school
                education and then, more importantly, to move on to tertiary
                education, particularly university. That was important. There is
                no doubt that the 1947 Act created a new society in Northern
                Ireland. Change began in this society in the 1960s and the
                1970s. That change, and particularly the political change, would
                not have come about had it not been for the 1947 Act.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Act was legislation of its time, but
                things have moved forward. Working for a number of years in a
                secondary school, I saw the divisiveness of a bipartite
                education system. Many of my pupils became very successful in
                their careers, whether they attended university or teacher
                training college or whether they moved into industry or
                business.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Things have changed. It is a great shame that
                the DUP had to pull off its stunt today. Education is one of the
                most important issues and responsibilities that the Assembly
                deals with. It shows that devolution can bring about change.
                That can be seen across the board in many of the Assembly’s
                areas of responsibility — we can bring about change.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most of us agree that selection at age 11 is
                wrong. I welcome the fact that the report does not deal with
                educational structures but with principles. That is important. I
                congratulate the Committee for focusing on the principles. Like
                most Members, I am looking forward to the publication of Gerry
                Burns’s report on Wednesday. This debate is a worthwhile
                preamble to that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Changes in post-primary education can provide
                more opportunities to develop integrated education in Northern
                Ireland. There are various ways to do that. I have made no
                secret that I strongly believe in the development of a
                Dickson-type plan for education where the first three years are
                all-ability. I hope that pupils from across the communities in
                Northern Ireland will be educated together. That is an important
                opportunity that is provided by the changes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report refers to parental choice.
                Parental choice is an absolute fallacy — it does not exist.
                Over the years many of my constituents have wanted to send their
                children to schools that were perceived as integrated in nature,
                if not in name.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They were deprived of that opportunity
                because the Department insisted that their children went either
                to a Catholic grammar school or to one of the state, or private,
                grammar schools closest to where they lived.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Change will come whether we like it or not.
                However, it is important that we get it right, and that is why
                the principle of phasing-in, put forward by the Committee, is
                important. Equally important is the need to make available the
                resources required to bring about the necessary change. My
                favoured option will cost money. As someone who believes
                strongly in the development of educational facilities in
                Northern Ireland I strongly believe that the Assembly should
                have tax-varying and tax-raising powers in line with those of
                the Scottish Parliament. Unless we provide such a facility I see
                major problems in accruing the funding necessary to bring about
                the change.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the report and congratulate the
                Chairperson, the Committee and the Clerk in producing it at a
                very important time. I look forward to its implementation and
                the change that all of us want to see.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I avoided referring to anyone in the House
                when I asked that question.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is very important that people appreciate
                what children have to go through in the 11-plus. One wonderful
                example was the question &quot;This watch has no batteries: what
                do you do to make it go?&quot; My son said &quot;Put in some
                batteries&quot;. That was the wrong answer. Simple logic was not
                correct. The answer was &quot;Wind it up&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many Members will appreciate the question in
                which my son had to write the opposite of a word by using a
                prefix such as &quot;im-&quot;, &quot;ir-&quot;, &quot;dis-&quot;
                or &quot;anti-&quot;. One of the words given was
                &quot;agreement&quot;. My son wrote &quot;anti- agreement&quot;,
                and he was marked wrong. His teacher said &quot;You mustn’t
                bring politics into this class. It is disagreement, not
                anti-agreement&quot;. Such an argument is illogical? It is
                unfair to put kids — who try their best — through a system
                that confines them to a narrow &quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;No&quot;,
                or &quot;I don’t know&quot; and does not allow for creativity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore I commend paragraph 6.2.2 of the
                report, which states that:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the current test should cease to be

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a pity that it did not happen today,
                thus preventing my son from having to go through that trauma in
                three weeks’ time. It is to be hoped that it will happen as
                soon as possible to prevent other children having to go through
                that sort of test and trauma.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sorry that the Committee did not go
                further. The constraints of trying to achieve cross-community
                support meant that there was a certain inability to take a
                stance on the options, in one direction or another, but I am
                glad that we got this far. I am pleased that foreign languages
                are listed as playing an important part in the early years of
                the curriculum. It is essential that children learn a second or
                third language at an early stage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Integrated education is not mentioned enough
                in the report. The Women’s Coalition believes wholeheartedly
                that education must play a part in healing the divisions in our
                community. It believes that a more just, appropriate and
                inclusive education system must be devised. I am sorry that the
                report does not go into that in more detail. The only way to
                promote a peaceful community is for children to experience the
                other side as human beings capable of friendships and
                understanding. It can be achieved only by the integration of
                children of all abilities and religions and, indeed, those who
                have other values or no religion. The education system must
                incorporate and express respect for all children and nourish
                them equally. The need for teacher training in integrated
                education, which is sadly lacking in this society, should also
                be included. Integration must become a matter of public policy.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr K Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the Member talks about integrated
                education, does she mean the bringing together of all children
                from all communities in one school system, or is she talking
                about a specific, contrived system that sets itself apart from
                existing systems and further dilutes the opportunity to bring
                all children together? Earlier I spoke about bringing post-16
                children together. There are opportunities to do that, but I did
                not mean in a separate system; I meant within the existing
                framework.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There seems to be an implied criticism of the
                integrated education sector there. I hope not. <i>[Interruption]</i>
                I hear the Member saying &quot;No.&quot;</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am promoting the integrated education
                system that now educates 6% of children in Northern Ireland. It
                is a pure integrated education system that brings Catholics,
                Protestants and others together in integrated schools that
                Members know well — Lagan College, Hazelwood College,
                Strangford College. Those schools provide a model that is
                important in Northern Ireland. We do not need to build schools
                on greenfield sites; existing schools can transform themselves
                to gain integrated status. Integration is about respecting each
                other and learning about each other’s communities, religions
                and cultures. It is about teachers and boards of governors being
                integrated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If resources were spent wisely, they would
                create further community cohesion, rather than pandering to the
                self-interest of any particular sector. While the Women’s
                Coalition respects and accepts the rights of parents and
                children to choose, it believes that there is enough evidence to
                show that many people in Northern Ireland, if they had real
                choices, would choose integrated education — that is vital.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Women’s Coalition thinks — and the
                Education Committee’s report endorses this — that the
                creation of a unified, cohesive model is entirely feasible and
                that there is enough expertise and creative thinking in
                educational circles to do it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That model will not only embrace the
                principles endorsed by the Committee and contained in many of
                the submissions, including our own, to this report and the Burns
                review, but — given the declining number of children in
                Northern Ireland — will also create a system that will begin
                to unify and heal and allow all children to fulfil their
                potential. Our argument does not compromise the standards of
                excellence on which we all agree. Our model — an integrated,
                comprehensive school system — recognises cultural diversity
                and religious or philosophical value systems; allows for the
                nurturing of those things without detriment to other priorities;
                encourages inclusion and parity of esteem for different cultures
                and languages; and widens opportunity for all, regardless of
                background.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I applaud the Committee for the report and
                for the hard work that was put into it. It was an excellent
                exercise, which has opened up a series of important educational
                issues and amassed an impressive body of opinion. When I think
                about education, I return to my student days and the concept of
                equality of opportunity. That is still a pertinent concept; the
                important thing is not only equality of access, but equality of
                opportunity. The system must ensure that all children have the
                same opportunities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report, rightly, refers to
                underachievement and the consequent skills shortage. In the
                minutes of evidence there is reference to the growth in grammar
                school numbers from 27% to 35% of the pupil cohort. The report
                suggests that there are literacy and numeracy problems in that
                sector for the first time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Open enrolment had a major impact on the
                post- primary sector. Members will recall that the former chief
                inspector of schools, Mr Ivan Wallace, described it as a process
                of bringing market forces into education. Children and parents
                were to be treated as customers, and the concept of service was
                lost. Such a policy is inappropriate in education. Many Members
                will also have experience of market forces through their
                membership of local councils. Recently an academic asked whether
                the same concept would be applied to the police. I could imagine
                Chris Patten trying to do that. Should we call the boys that the
                police arrest &quot;customers&quot;? Should the police say
                &quot;I hope that you have a nice stay in your three-star cell
                tonight, sir&quot;? There is a limit to how far business notions
                can be applied to certain areas, particularly public services.
                The Committee must ensure that that is better balanced with the
                other work that is being done, such as the report from the Burns
                review body, in order to take the pressure off schools.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The most valuable recommendation is the
                abolition of the 11-plus examination. The SDLP has been calling
                for that since its inception in 1969 — the issue was raised at
                the first conference. The report recommends that the 11-plus be
                replaced by a transfer profile. The Committee says that more
                work must be done on that, and it is important for us to figure
                out how that system will work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also important to have a complete view
                of a pupil’s ability and performance. However, the transfer
                test should not be substituted. A non-selective system should be
                just that, but by replacing the 11-plus would we not be
                replicating the initial problem? In that respect I am a little
                critical of the report’s position. The Committee’s idea
                could be open to abuse, and it needs to be monitored carefully.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Primary school principals used to have a
                slight degree of latitude in grading pupils. I heard many
                stories of headmasters returning home to find televisions and
                other nice presents, which had been left by expectant parents.
                Can you imagine the parental pressure on the principal and the
                staff during the preparation of the profile? I strongly argue
                that while the idea has perhaps not yet been fully thought out,
                it needs to be monitored carefully by the Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, will the transfer profile help
                to eradicate the distortion of the primary 6 and primary 7
                curriculum? Is there not a danger that that will become profile
                time, rather than curriculum time? That is a second reason to be
                careful.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The concept of the &quot;neighbourhood
                school&quot; did not receive the justice that the Committee
                might have given it. We do much damage to the local community by
                taking many of the best 11-year-old youngsters 20 or 30 miles
                away from their community to educate them with children who have
                travelled similar distances. Thus, they begin the early process
                of emigration from their local town or area. That process
                continues when they go on to higher education.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must not lose sight of the strong argument
                for having a school at the heart of a community. I hope that we
                can return to those values, if not for any other reason than an
                economic one — although there are many social and community
                reasons. A school in the heart of the community would help to
                keep those with leadership potential in the community in which
                they were born and reared, and to which they could continue to
                contribute.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am a long-time supporter of vocational
                education, and I remember the days when one felt like a
                missionary when trying to encourage people to look at that form
                of education. I strongly welcome the recognition that it is
                given and the fact that it is no longer marginalised. Even so,
                it would have been nice if vocational education had been clearly
                referred to in the recommendations. However, I have enough
                conviction in the bulk of the report to believe that that key
                component will not be missed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Point 6.1.8 has already been referred to my
                Colleagues on both sides. It states that:</p>

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is a real truism. In the last 15 to 20
                years no other profession has had to undergo and suffer as many
                changes to its professional work as much as teachers have done.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It really is remarkable how so many people
                have endured and emerged still sane.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that when these worthwhile
                recommendations begin to be implemented, teachers will be given
                time for training and time to absorb them at a pace that does
                not affect the welfare of the children and the health of the
                teaching profession. It is no secret. The teaching profession’s
                early retirement rate over the last number of years and the
                waiting lists for replacements show that it is difficult. People
                are not taking teaching on as enthusiastically as before, and
                there is a serious problem. We need to be careful how we go
                about implementing these recommendations. That is a concern I
                have, and I hope the Committee will take it on board.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will start by speaking as Chairperson of
                the Committee for Employment and Learning. That Committee will
                welcome this report, and I congratulate all involved in its
                production. Obviously, it will have to be considered alongside
                the Burns inquiry report that will come out later this week, but
                the significant thing is that it emerges from a process that is
                democratically accountable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From the perspective of the Committee for
                Employment and Learning, there is one significant aspect. Once
                the 11-to-16-year-old age group is better dealt with, it will be
                possible to make certain changes that are necessary for
                education in the older 16 to 19 age group. There will be
                implications for the future of further education colleges, and,
                indeed, curriculum reform was referred to in the report from my
                Committee published a week ago. With certain subjects at A
                level, notably mathematics, physics and chemistry, there has
                been a relative decline — in some cases an absolute decline
                — in the numbers of young people taking those subjects. I am
                pleased to see that some of the recommendations here hint at
                approaches to dealing with this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report seems to be recommending the
                retention of what is good while raising standards in what
                statisticians call &quot;the long tail of lower
                performance&quot;. Undoubtedly that is quite sound, and there is
                resonance with some issues that have emerged in the Department
                for Employment and Learning — for example, about 25% of adults
                here have the lowest measured level of literacy and numeracy. We
                note that compared to the German and other continental European
                economies there is a shortfall in the level of qualification of
                our workforce. Significantly, that does not occur so much at
                degree level as at apprenticeship, sub-degree, diploma and HND
                and HNC level, which hints at what may be happening in secondary
                schools relative to grammar schools.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will now speak briefly as an MLA. As the
                report suggests, it is probably right that the current transfer
                procedure is not sustainable. It is pleasing that the Committee
                has proposed both short-term and longer-term reform of it. The
                report is valuable in helping us to think about selection and
                selectivity. Perhaps the problem is not so much selectivity per
                se, but the grounds on which selection is made. The Committee
                rightly looked at practice in Great Britain and other parts of
                western Europe. However, if time and resources had allowed, it
                should have considered some of the interesting developments in
                American schools over the last decade or so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is possible to talk about an
                Anglo-American approach, as exemplified by the city technology
                colleges in English inner cities and by the so-called charter
                schools and magnet schools in American inner cities. These have
                introduced school reform amid massive social problems and
                massive social division, so they are not dissimilar to some
                schools in Belfast.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Anglo-American approach allows schools to
                specialise, and diversity is encouraged rather than curbed. Such
                schools select their pupils on a range of criteria, not just on
                academic ability and aptitude.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Billy Hutchinson spoke of schools that
                specialise in sport, IT, music and other subjects. Northern
                Ireland can learn from the experiences of English and American
                cities. As Prime Minister Tony Blair said on 8 September 2000:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We now have the end of a one size fits
                all mentality in schools.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased that the Committee has looked at
                the German example, because the former West Germany in
                particular is an interesting social laboratory in that respect.
                Some German Länder have comprehensives, some have selectivity
                based on parental choice and some have selectivity based on
                examinations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many parts of Germany seem to have succeeded
                in maintaining a diversity of school types after the age of 11
                by keeping a model that approaches parity of esteem: they have
                the academic Gymnasien and the vocational Realschulen.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a very instructive example for Northern
                Ireland, and one that my own party noted in its policy position,
                which we offered to the Burns review. As policies develop, we
                must avoid a &quot;Rip van Winkle&quot; approach; we must not
                pretend that we fell asleep in 1969 or 1972 and that we can
                simply apply the policies of that time and forget that the world
                has moved on.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was an unholy alliance in the late
                1960s and early 1970s between the Labour Education Secretary,
                Tony Crosland, who went to a public school, and, later, the
                Conservative Education Secretary, Margaret Thatcher, who
                attended Grantham Grammar School, I believe. Together they
                closed down most of England’s grammar schools.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Significantly, Northern Ireland’s
                examination results have improved relative to England’s since
                1971, and the gap is widening. That is no accident; it
                corresponds to the introduction of that great, or perhaps
                infamous, experiment of comprehensive education in England. It
                is an experiment, the Prime Minister has hinted, that is over
                and that has failed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The teaching integrated mathematics and
                science (TIMS) studies show that the teaching of these subjects
                has deteriorated in Scottish comprehensives. On the whole, I
                warmly welcome the report. It dovetails with the report by the
                Department for Employment and Learning. I urge the House to
                support the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Carson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. Many Members have
                spoken about the importance of the debate. However, it is
                disappointing to see that many parties have absented themselves.
                We can see the importance that they put on the debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I compliment the Chairperson and members of
                the Committee for Education on their stamina in collecting such
                a volume of information and views on post-primary education. One
                Committee member rightly said that you would almost need an
                education to follow the report. It was an impressive
                undertaking. Committee members come from different school
                backgrounds and allegiances, and it is to their credit that they
                got the report together. I commend them for that. I also
                compliment the Committee Chairperson’s initiative on having
                the Stationery Office capture almost 600 pages of minutes and
                papers on a CD- ROM. How does one take in such a volume of
                information?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reference to the contributions that would be
                necessary from teachers has not been given the priority that I
                think essential. Any major changes in the curriculum involving
                mixed-ability classes will impose demands on teachers, who will
                be required to cover a broad range of abilities. That is a
                tremendous demand on the teaching profession.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report is wide ranging, but there appear
                to be several contradictions. For example, paragraph 4.4.3
                states</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the need for fewer management
                teams&quot;,</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">while paragraph 4.5.3 states</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the possibility that more management
                teams may be required&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a small point.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Furthermore, paragraph 6.3.2 states:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;A core curriculum should be
                offered&quot;,</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">and a list of subject areas is given.
                However, paragraph 6.3.6 states:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;A broad ‘skills-based’ curriculum
                should be implemented&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps there is no contradiction, but it is
                a bit confusing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paragraph 6.3.2 states that the core
                curriculum should include</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;at least one additional Language&quot;

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps we could take on board the Scottish
                secondary school curriculum and stipulate that one modern
                European language be included.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The term &quot;parity of esteem&quot; figures
                prominently in the report. The expression is meaningless unless
                it clearly indicates the area being referred to. Is it parity of
                esteem between schools, pupils, subjects or awards?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yesterday and last week I noted the excellent
                results recorded in a report in the ‘The Sunday Times’ on
                the top 25 voluntary, grammar, and independent schools in
                Northern Ireland. All of the schools must be congratulated. In
                my constituency, Enniskillen Collegiate Grammar School obtained
                equal fourth rank in the whole of the UK. That is my old school.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It may not be possible to draw exact
                parallels with the results in GB, but the GCSE figures in
                Northern Ireland are only bettered by six GB schools. The top 13
                independent schools in Northern Ireland — with over 60%
                success rate in A levels — compare favourably with the upper
                200 schools in GB.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recommendation 6.1.9 states:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Any changes introduced should not

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the light of the superb results that I
                have just mentioned, the independent sector will flourish if
                parents are dissatisfied with the proposed new system. That is
                their prerogative in this age of parental choice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have much to be proud of in our present
                system in Northern Ireland. The Ulster Unionist Party’s
                response to the review states clearly that a diversified
                post-primary school system is the right way to meet the varied
                needs of our children, and that the existence of a
                differentiated system has proved its value in producing good
                academic results.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the words of the old cliché, we must

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I declare an interest in this debate as a
                parent governor of a primary school and as a parent of three
                young children who will leave primary school in the next five
                years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This debate is important to myself, my
                constituents, and everyone in Northern Ireland. Obviously I want
                the best for my children and for all the children in Northern
                Ireland, irrespective of their particular ability. The
                transition between schools should be as smooth as possible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the recommendation that the current
                selection procedure should be ended as soon as possible. I am
                aware of the variation in the degree of coaching that can occur
                between schools and out of schools, through tutors, et cetera. I
                do not want the education of my children to be unduly affected
                by the time taken up by artificial test papers. I want them to
                be educated for life, not for a transition exam.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As an engineer, I was always taught to
                examine the evidence and ensure that when I tackled a problem, I
                tackled the root cause. Some Members have been advocating a new
                comprehensive system for Northern Ireland, but I have not heard
                evidence that our current education structure is the root cause.
                We have high education standards in Northern Ireland, and those
                high standards must be maintained. However, we all must accept
                that there is a tail of underachievement, and that is where the
                focus of change must be. We must ensure that the young people
                who are being failed by our current system are given an
                opportunity and that they are switched on to education, not only
                in school, but also for life.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those who have advocated change have not
                addressed the core problem of underachievement. They are
                advocating change, but there is no guarantee that their
                particular change will improve the current situation of
                underachievement. It could result in the high standards that
                have been achieved being lowered.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Twenty-four percent of adults — who have
                been through the education system — are failing to meet basic
                international standards on numeracy and literacy. That is a big
                problem. Forty-four percent of those currently unemployed have
                no formal education, and we must tackle that. Those who urge an
                all-in-one system have still to advise how that system will best
                suit our young people. There has been a lack of clarity in what
                has been advocated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a member of the Education and Learning
                Committee I welcome recommendation 6.3.4, which would widen
                subject choice beyond the academic to include vocational and
                technical subjects. I am pleased that the Committee has made
                that recommendation. It was contained in the Ulster Unionist
                document, ‘Excellence, Diversity and Choice’.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also welcome recommendation 6.3.10, on
                improving linkages between schools and further education
                colleagues. During our recent inquiry, the Education and
                Learning Committee learnt that if we can make education more
                relevant to our young people, and particularly to those who are
                underachieving, they can become switched on to education and
                fully engaged in the learning process. In consultation with the
                Belfast Institute of Further and Higher Education and Bombardier
                Shorts, we learnt that by altering coursework to make it more
                interesting and appropriate, 100% success rates could be
                achieved in some engineering courses.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, pilot schemes in the north-west
                were, encouragingly, improved by the increased use of a
                vocational model in the final year for students whose attendance
                had been unacceptably poor. If underachievers attend school for
                only 75% of the time, they will not succeed, no matter what type
                of education they receive. The pilots showed that work
                experience, and a greater involvement with further education
                colleges, could assist in reducing absentee levels by showing
                the students the relevance of what they were doing and could
                help them to go further.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Lewsley spoke of the divisiveness of the
                present system and wished that all children be educated
                together. Had she nothing to say about the maintained education
                sector? Her comments could be applied equally to both systems in
                Northern Ireland. Why can our children not attend our state
                schools together for the benefit of all? That would allow us to
                offer greater diversity to our children in rural towns or in the
                middle of Belfast; it would also reduce the busing budget.
                Children would be integrated, but not in a selective manner; and
                more parents would send their children to such schools than send
                them to the present integrated sector. All children, not just
                those of the middle classes, would have an integrated education,
                and that would improve our society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the report’s emphasis on local
                solutions, because we do not have a clean canvas. There has been
                major investment in our school structures. Admittedly, many of
                them are in a poor state, but the cost of rebuilding and moving
                our children into a communal comprehensive system would be
                prohibitive. That system, as advocated in England and in
                Scotland, has created problems of social engineering through
                selection by proximity to schools. House prices, housing
                location and wages begin to determine the schools for which
                children will be selected.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our vision for Northern Ireland should be an
                all- encompassing one. We do not want that sort of selectivity;
                we want to ensure that there is a mixed community in all our
                schools. We also want to ensure that we provide the highest
                possible standards.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are problems that have not been
                addressed by those advocating a particular model. It is
                important to move forward cautiously and to take some of the
                other recommendations of this report on local solutions into
                consideration. It is also important to consult widely locally as
                well as through the educational structures.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is easy to say that one will improve
                matters; it is much more difficult to ensure that one does not
                destroy the good in the existing system. I urge cautious
                movement forward, but I support the motion and look forward to
                its implementation.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under the auspices of the North/South
                Ministerial Council, I have agreed with Joe Walsh that scrapie
                eradication must be tackled through an all-island approach. The
                nature of the disease and of the sheep population in Ireland
                means that it makes sense to adopt a unified approach. Officials
                from the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development are
                working with colleagues in the Department of Agriculture, Food
                and Rural Development on a consultation document which will set
                out the thinking on how to tackle the disease. Suggestions will
                include genotyping — a method of breeding resistance to
                scrapie into the sheep population — and other more focused
                eradication measures. It is hoped that the consultation document
                will be issued in the next few weeks. Our overall aim is to have
                a programme of eradication in place by the end of December.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Minister is aware, the findings of
                recent research in Britain into BSE in sheep gave cause for
                concern. Is the Minister still going ahead with her plan despite
                the revelations arising from that research?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes, BSE can be transmitted experimentally to
                sheep. UK sheep had access to contaminated feed in the 1990s,
                so, theoretically, there could be a problem. Therefore it makes
                sense, from a number of points of view, to go ahead and try to
                eradicate the disease.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problems that have arisen with the
                research were the responsibility of the Department for
                Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The problem with the
                research and the discovery of the mistake with the brains that
                were being examined would not have happened had it not been that
                the devolved Administrations, the Welsh scientists initially,
                asked for further DNA testing to ensure that there was no cross
                contamination. This was supported by the Scots and Northern
                Irish Ministers. If that had not happened, we would not be in
                the fortunate situation of having discovered the mistake.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to make three points. First, BSE can
                be transmitted experimentally to sheep, and UK sheep had access
                to contaminated feed. Research work will continue in order to
                establish whether there is a risk. It remains important that we
                have a contingency plan to deal with any research findings that
                suggest that it does. The draft form of the plan has recently
                been put to the industry in Northern Ireland for comment by
                early December. I ask recipients to consider it and let my
                Department have their views.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, the Northern Ireland scrapie
                eradication plan that my Department is developing will still go
                ahead, as we know that the theoretical potential is there for
                sheep to harbour BSE that may be masquerading as scrapie, which
                we have to eliminate from the Northern Ireland flock.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, an important point is that the
                research that is underway in GB is looking mainly if not
                entirely at the situation in GB, and there is an obvious
                temptation for conclusions from that work to be applied to
                Northern Ireland. Therefore my officials have asked the Food
                Standards Agency to ensure that any research into the risks of
                sheep meat for consumers takes specific account of our lower
                reported incidents of scrapie, BSE and sporadic and variant CJD.
                This suggests that any problems presented by sheep — and there
                may be none — may be lower here than in GB.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no realistic possibility of the
                European Union considering our case for low-incidence status for
                BSE until a reasonable proportion of the results of our current
                screening tests, and those of the other EU member states, are
                known. So far, we have tested over 8,300 animals and have only
                found 17 confirmed positives. That augurs well because the
                proportion of positives is very low, and if that continues it
                will show that Northern Ireland has a very low incidence of BSE.
                However, we have only tested a small proportion of our total, so
                it is early days yet to be drawing conclusions. It will not be
                until the end of the year that we will see the comparable
                results from the other European countries, to see where we
                stand. I cannot change the pace of the testing, but as soon as
                the time is right and we have a good case to make, I will make
                that case.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot state yet what the true incidence of
                BSE is in other countries. The surveillance results published so
                far by the Commission give the figures only for July — the
                first month of the EU-wide testing. It will be the end of the
                year before sufficient surveillance data emerges to give a
                reliable statistical base from which to make true comparisons. I
                am confident that the incidence in Northern Ireland will compare
                very favourably with that in other countries. We will be
                properly able to argue our case only when we have the figures.
                We have already tested 8,300 animals — we have 50,000 to test
                — so it is difficult to draw a conclusion from such a small
                number, although the indications are encouraging.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The organic farming scheme was introduced in
                June 1999. It increased significantly the amount of aid
                available to prospective organic producers, especially in the
                first two years of conversion. Since the introduction of the
                scheme, 64 producers, farming a total of just over 3,400
                hectares, have been accepted into it. Payments to producers
                under the scheme in the 2000-01 financial year totalled
                £470,000. I have also commissioned, and published for
                consultation, a strategic study on the best way to develop
                organic farming in Northern Ireland to a position where 1,000
                producers will be farming 30,000 hectares organically by 2006.
                The closing date for receipt of comments is 30 November 2001.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, earlier this year I secured £2
                million from the Executive programme funds for a scheme to
                assist some 150 to 200 farmers over the next three years with
                the extra costs of converting, or providing, animal housing
                systems to comply with organic standards. The scheme is subject
                to state-aid approval from the European Commission.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given the increasing demand for organic
                products, does the Minister regard the numbers quoted as being
                anywhere near adequate to meet consumer demand and the changing
                needs of agriculture? Does the Minister agree that giving the
                entire population easier access to organic products could mean
                that the growing demand on our Health Service would be greatly
                reduced?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A proposed increase to 30,000 hectares from
                an initial figure of 3,400 hectares is a substantial increase. I
                understand that there is an increasing market demand for organic
                food in Northern Ireland, but it is still not as great as that
                in other places, and it is confined to specific categories and
                classes of food. The proposed increase, and the target of 1,000
                producers from a base of 64, is considerable, and I am happy
                that that is the case.</p>

                there is a market for organic farm produce. We are not producing
                enough organic food at present, and that means importing a great
                deal of organic produce from across the water. Organic farming
                appears to be profitable. Because that market exists, we are
                encouraging farmers and providing the necessary resources to
                cope with the length of time that it takes to change to organic

                it is my intention to conduct an independent investigation into
                the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Northern Ireland. That
                review will highlight the lessons to be learned from the
                epidemic so that we will be better prepared for any future
                events of that nature. The terms of reference of the
                investigation are to review the outbreak of foot-and-mouth
                disease in Northern Ireland with particular reference to
                contingency plans, preparedness, cause, spread, handling,
                logistics, compensation, cross-border issues and trade

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the light of the lessons learned, the
                review should make recommendations to me by 31 March 2002 on how
                future outbreaks of epizootic diseases here should be handled.
                The review will be conducted by independent consultants, who
                will be selected by tender and will provide their own
                secretariat. The deadline of 31 March may be a little ambitious
                and may require further review. The function of the review is
                not to pass judgement on the actions of the Government,
                individuals or groups but to identify areas where improvements
                can be made.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What are the precedents for conducting an
                inquiry of this sort by a competitive tendering? Does the
                Minister expect that farmers and others will accept that an
                exercise carried out by a business which is commercially
                responsible to the Department that is commissioning it will
                fully consider the facts and criticise the Department where
                necessary? Does she expect to be more successful than the
                Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs was in
                persuading people that the internal investigation in England and
                Wales was conducted in an independent manner? Would it not be
                better to take a little longer to bring in independent experts,
                in whom there could be true confidence, to ensure that the
                inquiry has positive results and is acted upon, rather than do
                something that appears unacceptable?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I have been at pains to explain to the
                Committee that this is not an inquiry, which would have all the
                implications of a public inquiry. This is a review of the
                outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. I am satisfied that it will
                be independent. It is being carried out by consultants.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nevertheless, there is no point in having a
                review that just tells us what we want to hear. As Minister, I
                would not countenance paying consultants to conduct a review on
                the basis that they were careful not to offend us. As I said,
                the review has a very wide remit and will look at every aspect
                of the handling of the foot-and-mouth outbreak in Northern
                Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am happy that the review — not the
                &quot;inquiry&quot; — will be open and accountable. There will
                be no formal hearings with lawyers and submissions of evidence.
                The consultants will interview and take written input from all
                principal stakeholders as well as from anyone else who wishes to
                contribute. The findings of the review will be published in due
                course. I hope that Members see that I am conducting the
                exercise in a totally open way from start to finish. I have been
                open and honest at all stages during the foot-and-mouth
                epidemic, and I intend to be so with this review.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last year’s EU farm structure survey showed
                that some 16,000 to 17,000 women work on farms in Northern
                Ireland. Of those, 12,000 are farmers’ spouses. As the Member
                knows, I am fully committed to the promotion of equality of
                opportunity in all walks of life and well aware of the
                considerable contribution made by women to agriculture and rural
                life.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the ambitious social survey
                undertaken by my Department will be completed by spring 2002.
                That will throw greater light on the contribution made by women
                to family farms and will provide information on their
                aspirations for training and development. That should enable us
                to identify gaps in existing provision and to assess how such
                gaps might be filled.</p>

                rural women. What particular training programmes are provided?
                Can a woman as Minister of Agriculture stop the drift of women
                from the land?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Department of Agriculture and Rural
                Development colleges provide a comprehensive range of lifelong
                training and learning programmes tailored to the needs of those
                who work in the Northern Ireland agrifood industry. Increasing
                numbers of such women are participating in that lifelong
                learning provision, and that trend has been especially apparent
                in information technology and business management programmes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, my Department has supported the
                development and delivery of the Women In Agriculture programme
                in County Fermanagh, involving more than 200 women. That
                programme was launched in 1999 and aims to facilitate the
                competence development needs of women with farming backgrounds.
                Training provided has included farm administration, secretarial
                skills, IT in agriculture and livestock management. The
                programme also incorporates a farmhouse food initiative that has
                resulted in the establishment of four microbusinesses. The
                success of the programme will be marked by a special event,
                Celebration of Women Day, at Enniskillen College on 2 November
                2001. I plan to attend, circumstances permitting.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to Mr Dallat’s question about a
                woman being Minister of Agriculture, I am very pleased to say
                that as I go round various events I notice that more and more
                women are becoming involved in rural development and other
                farming activities. Perhaps having a woman as Minister of
                Agriculture is not a disincentive.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One major sphere of interest and concern that
                has always attracted serious attention in the Nationalist/

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is a sphere in which the minority
                community in Northern Ireland has been proactive for many years,
                but one in which the majority community has shown only a
                reactive or passive interest. The result has been a significant
                series of perceived gains by Nationalists and losses by
                Unionists, including the promotion of the Irish language, the
                problematisation of long-standing majority marching rights and
                the retrospective challenging of appointment and selection
                procedures in the workplace. All those things have enhanced —
                and will continue to enhance — Nationalist solidarity, while
                discouraging and marginalising the majority population, which,
                in the context of Ireland as a whole, is really a large
                minority. Significantly, there has been a call in the Republic
                for the revision of school history books to give greater impetus
                to the movement for national unity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the majority community in Northern Ireland
                is to maximise its potential in the important years ahead, close
                attention must be paid to enabling Unionists to feel increasing
                pride in and commitment to their cultural past, as the basis of
                a constructive future. They must be helped to explore their
                roots, past struggles and achievements and to develop a sense of
                pride in the contributions made by their ancestors and their
                contemporaries to the development of Ulster. For that to happen,
                a clear and detailed cultural education policy is required in
                our schools. It should be a policy of truthful analysis and
                celebration that will inform and buttress the majority
                population in a period of change that many may find, at best,
                unsettling and, at worst, highly threatening.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A cultural educational policy for the
                Unionist and British majority in Northern Ireland must in no
                sense be construed as an attack on the minority population.
                Rather, it should be viewed as clarification and confirmation of
                the Unionist identity, in the context of 10,000 years in the
                life of the people of Ireland. It should be centred on the
                ancient tradition of the Brytenwalda and should, on the basis of
                the past and present, look to a future in which the several
                traditions in Ulster have a significant role to play, but in
                which the majority’s perspectives are clearly perceived to be
                worthy of respect and good stewardship.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Both main traditions — one ignoring the
                fullness of its history and culture in Ireland, the other
                unaware of any real history and culture, other than its own —
                have imperilled the possibility of co-existence based on mutual
                understanding and respect. The Assembly has offered us the
                opportunity to rectify that situation in our schools. It is of
                great importance that steps be taken to do so as soon possible.
                We would be mad to lose the opportunity.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate the Committee on a fine piece
                of work. It is clear that a great deal of effort went into the
                report. It has enabled us to have an informed and informative
                debate. I am disappointed at the number of Members — from
                across the board — present for such a useful debate. I am
                especially disappointed that the Minister of Education, rather
                than attend, is engaged in extra-curricular activities. At
                least, his case shows that academic achievement is not always
                needed to rise to the highest posts.</p>

                themselves; I referred to poor attendance by Members from across
                the board.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue of post-primary education is rooted
                in the reforms of the 1940s. It is important to realise the
                extent to which those reforms opened doors for people. Neil
                Kinnock said that he was</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the first Kinnock in a thousand
                generations to be able to get to university&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My family, like many others, saw the
                opportunity for third-level education as stemming from the
                reforms of the 1940s. Therefore, we should be loath to throw the
                baby out with the bath water and completely rid ourselves of a
                system that has served Northern Ireland fairly well.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In looking at the changes that are required
                and at the current system, we must avoid falling into the trap
                of getting too involved with dogma, or of looking only at good
                intentions that may not work. For example, I agree with some of
                Joan Carson’s criticisms. She said that we must be careful in
                the way that we use parity of esteem. If we take that concept to
                its limit in the education system, we will have a system where
                every pupil scores the same mark in every exam because we will
                not want to feel that anyone has been discriminated against or
                disadvantaged. We must be practical.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was not helpful that one of the Members on
                the opposite Benches quoted statistics that were 15 years old
                and out of date. I do not share the view of the Women’s
                Coalition, which offered us the nightmare vision of pupils in
                years to come threatening passers-by with the horrors of street
                theatre. We must develop a system that is grounded in realism.
                We need what I call the &quot;JESO test&quot;. The system must
                be just, it must maintain and improve educational standards, and
                it must be open and transparent. We must judge the key issues
                against that background.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are two fundamental issues at stake.
                The first is whether we have selection in schools. The second
                is, if we have selection, what form it will take. On the first
                issue, I remain unconvinced by the advocates of comprehensive
                education. If we say that there should be no selection procedure
                between the primary and secondary levels of education, we are
                advocating comprehensive education. However, we must look at the
                way that comprehensive education has worked.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another Member said that the gap between
                Northern Ireland’s success rate and that of the rest of United
                Kingdom has increased. Yet another said that many years ago
                Northern Ireland had a higher percentage of people leaving
                school without any qualifications. However, in recent years we
                have reached the point where fewer people in Northern Ireland
                leave school with no qualifications than is the case in the rest
                of the United Kingdom. From a purely academic point of view,
                comprehensive education has not provided the solution to the
                problem of how to raise standards.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, with regard to social
                inclusiveness and helping disadvantaged people, there are still
                problems that must be addressed, and we must focus on those.
                However, in Northern Ireland there are a higher percentage of
                school-leavers from working-class backgrounds attaining
                third-level education than in the rest of the United Kingdom, so
                comprehensive education has not produced a greater level of
                success.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recently had a conversation with a couple
                of my party colleagues. I cannot remember whether it was Philip
                Weir or Clive McFarland who asked me what the point was in
                replacing a flawed system based on ability with a system that is
                largely based on the ability to pay. One point that the report
                highlighted very well was that we do not want to see a large
                independent sector grow up in Northern Ireland in response to
                whatever proposals we make for changing the education system. If
                that were to happen, we would have a system like that in
                England, where most pupils are served by a large comprehensive
                system, while the elite get into public schools on the basis of
                their parents’ ability to pay, rather than the ability of the
                pupils themselves. The current system is clearly flawed, but if
                we move to a system that is based on elitism by money rather
                than ability, we will be moving backwards. The case for
                selection is strong.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If there is to be selection, the question is
                what form that should take. I agree with some of the cautions
                that have been given in relation to the report. If applied
                properly, continuous assessment can provide a truer picture of
                pupils’ abilities, but, as Tom Hamilton said, it is not a
                perfect system. It is important to remove the subjective
                elements. Billy Hutchinson also expressed concern about that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because of my age, I had a unique experience
                of the 11-plus, by comparison with other Members. When I was in
                primary 7 a system that did not operate in any other year was
                introduced, with the effect that each school ranked its own
                pupils. The pupils then sat an exam on an anonymous basis, and
                each school was told how many of its pupils had achieved top,
                middle or bottom grades. The schools then allocated the grades
                according to their previous list. That system, I believe, was
                dropped after just one year. That was partly because of concerns
                that the system — despite the many fine people who were
                involved in its creation — was open to abuse, and could be
                affected by subjective opinion. If we are to adopt a system of
                continuous assessment, standardised tests will be necessary to
                enable everybody to compete on a level playing field.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, continuous assessment is not
                necessarily the perfect solution. Members have expressed
                concerns about the level of stress and strain that the 11-plus
                system places upon 10- and 11-year-old pupils. However, if
                placed under continuous assessment a pupil might feel under
                constant stress for one or two years, rather than the few months
                before the exam. Therefore, while I support the report’s broad
                recommendations for the re-examination of the transfer
                procedure, I caution that some of the proposed solutions have
                associated problems.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If such changes are to be made, we must
                ensure that teachers are given support, because a system of
                continuous assessment will place an additional burden on teacher
                numbers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As many Members have said, we must focus on
                ways to &quot;retain the best but improve the rest&quot; — a
                useful phrase that was used by several Members. In particular,
                we must identify problem areas where help and additional support
                can be given, and we should examine ways to improve the system.
                Until a better alternative emerges, we must not be tempted to
                throw out everything for the sake of what appears to be a
                perfect model or a system that will create some sort of social
                experiment. The key test is to examine the practical educational
                implications, and to try to implement a system that protects the
                best in Northern Ireland’s education and improves conditions
                for those at the bottom end. I urge Members to support the
                report.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Kennedy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful for the opportunity to make a
                winding-up speech. I am pleased at the level and quality of this
                important and useful debate. I am sorry that the Minister was
                not present and that Members did not attend in large numbers. I
                am grateful to the Members who did participate and who made
                extremely valuable contributions to the debate. I place on
                record my thanks to my colleagues on the Education Committee,
                the Clerk and other officials involved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several themes recurred in the debate. There
                was widespread agreement that the highest level of academic
                standards must be maintained in any change to the system. We
                must at least acknowledge the concerns about the current system
                and the need for change, and yet be cautious with that change.
                Any changes will need to result in a flexible system, with
                opportunities for all.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members also emphasised that collaborative
                arrangements will be crucial, particularly in higher and further
                education, and in links with industry and business
                organisations. There is also a clear requirement that we create
                a more equitable system. Underscoring that is the need for
                adequate resources to fund those changes and the need to
                consider the requirements of continuous training for the
                teachers involved. We should bear that important point in mind.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will respond to points made by Members.
                Patricia Lewsley said that education is the cornerstone of any
                society, and I strongly agree with that. That point highlights
                the importance of the issues that we are now considering.
                However, for the large part, Ms Lewsley concentrated on
                informing the House of SDLP party policy in respect of the
                11-plus, rather than outlining in detail her view on the report.
                However, I record my gratitude for her contribution in the
                Education Committee, and her abiding commitment to education.
                Likewise, Eileen Bell made a real contribution to the Education
                Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Billy Hutchinson raised the issue of early
                years learning. The Education Committee appreciates the
                importance of that matter, and that is why we have already
                launched an inquiry into it. We are at the early stages, but we
                have already received written submissions from a wide range of
                interested organisations and individuals. We also took evidence
                from the Youth Service on its views on post-primary education.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Prof McWilliams expressed concerns about the
                Education Committee’s proposals on the new school curriculum.
                I assure her — unfortunately, she is not here at present —
                that we are not attempting to be restrictive. Our
                recommendations are not exhaustive, and drama could, I suppose,
                be included. I welcome her assertion that it would be unwise for
                Northern Ireland to entertain an independent sector. However,
                that argument is at odds with the evidence relating to the
                Scottish comprehensive system, which is strongly advocated by
                Prof McWilliams. A substantial independent sector has been
                created by that comprehensive system. Prof McWilliams is rather
                at odds with herself on that issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McHugh expressed concern about the
                possible timescale for the implementation, and I remind him that
                it was Mr Gerry Burns who mentioned the period of 10 years in an
                interview in the ‘Belfast Telegraph’. The Education
                Committee has recommended that the current 11-plus tests should
                cease as soon as possible. Mr McHugh reconfirmed all his views
                and prejudices about the current system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome my Colleague Mr Robinson’s
                comments on the curriculum framework. He said that it should
                stretch and challenge all pupils so that they have the
                opportunity to maximise their own potential. That is crucial.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree that there should be no social
                engineering and that the report requires further consideration,
                as will the Burns review when it is published. Mr Ken Robinson’s
                comments on natural integration are worth bearing in mind. Mr
                Gallagher reminded us of the importance of preparing young
                people for the world of work and of providing them with the
                necessary skills for a modern economy. We should adapt the
                present system rather than abolish it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hamilton outlined the key principles
                underlining the Committee’s report when he used the words
                &quot;excellence&quot;, &quot;diversity&quot; and
                &quot;choice&quot;; coincidentally, these form the title of the
                UUP’s submission to the Burns review. I agree with him that
                standardised testing is important so that all children and all
                schools can be treated fairly in future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Fee spoke of the emotionally charged
                atmosphere in which the topic was raised, and the fact that the
                Education Committee had approached these matters carefully. Mr
                Fee played a major part in the Committee, and he strongly
                advocated abolishing the 11-plus. I say &quot;Amen&quot; to
                that, but I add &quot;in its current form&quot;. That may be the
                significant difference between us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Neeson welcomed the Education Committee’s
                focus on principles rather than on structures. &quot;Those are
                our principles, and if you do not like them, we have some
                more&quot;. That was a humorous digression. Those are our
                principles and we hope to measure them sufficiently against the
                Burns review. Mr Neeson, rather predictably, used the
                opportunity to discuss the matter of raising taxes on the people
                of Northern Ireland. I do not agree with him that parental
                choice is not important — it is increasingly important.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill spoke of the need to tackle
                underachievement and to improve low numeracy and literacy
                skills; this is a need of which the Education Committee is
                acutely conscious. He also referred to what might be called
                inducements to teachers with regard to pupil profiles. I assure
                him that such a profile would start with the pupil in early
                years and would continue throughout and that it would be subject
                to contributions from all the pupil’s teachers and would not
                be open to abuse.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jane Morrice’s contribution reminded me of
                one of those dreadful, mostly American, daytime quiz programmes,
                although we have our own version in Anne Robinson. Ms Morrice
                strongly supported the integrated education sector, and although
                I am happy to acknowledge the contribution that it makes I am
                concerned that there is criticism implicit in her remarks for
                those who teach in the controlled and maintained systems.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie welcomed the recommendations and
                was pleased that they agreed with his Committee’s report on
                education and training for industry. I strongly agree with Dr
                Birnie that we must avoid introducing &quot;bog- standard
                comprehensive schools&quot; into Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Joan Carson, my party Colleague,
                expressed concern that the local demands on schoolteachers were
                not being given priority. I assure the Member that the Education
                Committee was most concerned with the crucial role played by
                teachers, the contribution that they make and the need for their
                concerns to be taken into account; hence the inclusion of the
                relevant recommendation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with Mr Beggs, who highlighted the
                core problem of underachievement. He is wise to say that we
                ought to be cautious in our approach. Dr Adamson spotted what I
                hope is the only typing error. He had to go to the last section
                of the report to find it, but at least that proves that he read
                it. I agree with him about the importance of historical and
                cultural education in the future. I thank Mr Peter Weir for his
                endorsement of the report and the place that it will have in the
                debate that starts today and continues with the introduction of
                the Burns review. He was right to pay tribute to the current
                system. It has served us well, and we must be careful not to
                throw the baby out with the bath water.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In considering these issues, we are dealing
                with the future of all young people in Northern Ireland. The
                Education Committee is particularly conscious that the worst
                legacy would be to reduce in any way the high standards achieved
                by our education system. However, we have an opportunity to
                improve the system and to enable every individual to achieve
                their full potential. We must get it right. I thank all those
                who contributed to the debate, and I commend the motion to the
                Assembly.</p>
