<p align="left" class="H1DocumentHeading">THE TRANSITIONAL aSSEMBLY</p>
<p align="left" class="H2DocumentDate">Tuesday 12 December 2006</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 10.30 am (Madam Speaker in the  Chair).</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
<p align="left" class="H3SectionHeading">Private Members&rsquo; Business</p>
<p align="left" class="H4StageHeading">Introduction of the Offence of<br>
	Corporate Manslaughter</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee has agreed to allow two hours for each of today&rsquo;s  debates. The proposer of each motion will have 15 minutes to speak, and all  other Members will have 10 minutes.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
<p align="left" class="Q1QuoteIndented">That this Assembly calls upon the Government to  introduce legislation introducing the offence of corporate manslaughter to  Northern Ireland, where it could be proven that culpable negligence by a firm  was a major contributory factor to the death of an employee or subcontracted  worker; and further calls for the introduction of an additional offence of  secondary liability for corporate manslaughter, where it could be shown that a  company&rsquo;s failings were provably caused by the culpable negligence of one or  more individuals within the firm.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">The Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Bill is  currently in the House of Lords, having already passed through the House of  Commons. The Bill applies to Northern Ireland as well as to <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">England and Wales. In Scotland the offence of  corporate</span> manslaughter will be called corporate homicide. The Bill was  introduced in the House of Commons on 20 July 2006. It passed Standing  Committee B on 31 <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">October 2006 and looks  set to become law during 2007.</span></p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Therefore why, Madam Speaker, am I calling on the  Government to extend the legislation to Northern Ireland? The clue is the  second part of the motion.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">There I call for an additional offence of secondary  liability for corporate manslaughter, where it could be shown that the failings  of a company, public body or organisation were caused by the negligence of one  or more individuals in the firm or organisation involved. When I talk about  organisations, I include councils, health boards and Departments.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">The reason why I am calling for that extremely important  addition to be made to the legislation is not to  seek retribution, even though retribution is a perfectly legitimate  principle on which to base law. I seek that addition on the principle of  effective deterrence.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">An article on the Institute of Chartered Accountants in  England and Wales&rsquo;s (ICAEW) website summarises the likely impact of the  Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Bill as follows:</p>
<p align="left" class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;companies that comply with existing health and safety  legislation have nothing to fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">It continues:</p>
<p align="left" class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Companies found guilty of corporate manslaughter will  face an unlimited fine, as a well as a remedial order requiring the company to  address the cause of the fatality&rdquo;.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">The article concludes:</p>
<p align="left" class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;As long as employers exercise due diligence in  managing their health and safety risks, in the event of an accident, they are  likely to have most of that duty of care discharged under the law&rdquo;.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">The Government have confirmed that view. During the Bill&rsquo;s  passage, Ministers have stressed that no new burdens will be placed on  companies that already comply with health and safety legislation. In short, the  new corporate manslaughter law will impose penalties no different in form or  severity to existing health and safety legislation and manslaughter  legislation. Under existing legislation, unlimited fines are already in place. Imprisonment is already an option under  existing gross negligence manslaughter law.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Under that law, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) states  that, where it can be proven that:</p>
<p align="left" class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;There was a duty of care owed by the accused to the  deceased&rdquo;,</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">that</p>
<p align="left" class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;There was a breach of the duty of care by the  accused&rdquo;,</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">that the</p>
<p align="left" class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Death of the deceased was caused by breach of the  duty of care by the accused&rdquo;,</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">and that</p>
<p align="left" class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The breach of the duty of care by the accused was so  great&rdquo;,</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">that can be described as gross negligence and is therefore  a crime.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">The problem with existing legislation has always been that,  for a company to be prosecuted for gross negligence manslaughter, it is  necessary to identify a &ldquo;controlling mind&rdquo;, who is also personally guilty of  that manslaughter. It is not possible under present law to add up the  negligence of several individuals in order to  show that the company or corporate body was grossly negligent. A  specific individual must be identified as a &ldquo;controlling mind&rdquo; in order for  corporate manslaughter to be proven. For that reason, a separate offence of  corporate manslaughter had to be created.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">At present, under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act  1974, employers whose negligence leads to the death of an employee or a member  of the public can be convicted only where there is sufficient evidence to prove  that individual members of the senior management team were guilty. Those  individuals must be prosecuted before the company or corporate body can be  prosecuted. To date, only seven small businesses have been found guilty. It was  for that reason also that the new offence of corporate manslaughter had to be  created.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">When it becomes law, the Corporate Manslaughter and  Corporate Homicide Bill will give the courts the power to decide whether the  collective failings of a company&rsquo;s senior management team amount to a gross  breach of the company&rsquo;s responsibility to protect the health and safety of its  employees and the public.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">The Government have stated that examples of such breaches  will include failure to ensure that staff have adequate health and safety  training, to check that equipment is in a safe condition, and to check that  lifts are maintained and adequate fire precautions have been taken.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Under the proposed legislation, an organisation will be  guilty of the offence of corporate manslaughter if its activities are organised  by senior managers in such a way as to cause a person&rsquo;s death and amount to a  gross breach of a relevant duty of care that the organisation owed to the  deceased.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">To decide that question, any jury would have to consider  whether the evidence showed that the organisation had failed to comply with the  relevant health and safety legislation or guidance. The Bill also sets out a  number of other factors for the jury to consider, such as whether senior  managers sought to cause the organisation to profit from its health and safety failure. In other words, did the firm or  corporation deliberately cut corners  to reduce costs or boost profits?</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Critics of the proposed legislation are already concerned  that such additional factors will make it difficult to obtain a conviction. The  overriding and most worrying aspect of this  situation remains, however, that the new corporate manslaughter Bill  lacks teeth. It has virtually no effective deterrent impact beyond that of  existing legislation.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">It is appropriate, Madam Speaker, to define what we are  talking about in human terms. I began to call for corporate manslaughter  legislation three years ago following the death of one of my young constituents  in an accident during a motorway-upgrading and bridge-widening project near the  junction of the M1 and Black&rsquo;s Road at Dunmurry. His death was a tragedy for  his family. A young man&rsquo;s life; all the potential he has to offer &mdash; this is  beyond price.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">I felt that my young constituent&rsquo;s death had wider  implications. I have lost two other constituents to industrial accidents in the  past three years. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA)  reported that there were 24 fatal accidents in Northern Ireland in 1998-99.  There were 19 the following year; 16 the year after; 12 the year after that;  and 21 in the year 2002-03.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">More significantly, RoSPA reported that fatal accidents  were at a rate of 2&middot;17 per 100,000 employees in Northern Ireland in 1998-99,  compared to just 0&middot;8 in Great Britain. RoSPA summarised the situation as  follows: there are about 20 fatal injuries each year; 70,000 cases of ill  health are caused or aggravated by work activities each year; some 365,000 days  are lost due to accidents at work each year; and the cost to employers is up to  &pound;370 million and to the Northern Ireland taxpayer over &pound;500 million.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">RoSPA further indicated that there are about 350 deaths of  workers and members of the public in Great Britain every year due to reportable  accidents at work. Taken on a pro rata basis, that means that Northern Ireland  could expect to have about 10 deaths a year from accidents at work. Northern  Ireland has 20 fatalities a year &mdash; twice the Great Britain average. Workers are  twice as likely to be killed at work in Northern Ireland as they are in Great  Britain. That is why we in Northern Ireland need to take the problem more  seriously.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">For those reasons alone, quite apart from the human  tragedy, Northern Ireland must act. I am concerned that deterrent factors in  the proposed UK corporate man&shy;slaughter Bill are inadequate. These problems  could be best addressed by the introduction of a new offence of secondary  liability for corporate manslaughter. Juries could be asked to establish  whether management failure had caused or contributed to a death. On the basis  of such a finding, the Director of the Public Prosecution Service would then  determine whether an individual within a company should be prosecuted for  manslaughter.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Only individual responsibility for the death of a worker &mdash;  beyond the issue of overall company negligence &mdash; will make individual managers  take this issue seriously and give sufficient priority to worker safety.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Many feel that big organisations such as building firms  have broad backs and that if an organisation is blamed it will simply be  subject to financial penalties. That is not enough to change attitudes in the  construction industry. If the death of workers on site is to be taken  seriously, people will have to feel that they, individually, will face a  manslaughter charge if they have been negligent. That is the sort of sharp  focus that we need.</p>
<p align="left" class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">The duty of care underpins the operation of a civilised  society. Therefore the deterrent factor must loom large in the corporate  manslaughter legislation, and individual accountability must not be lost sight  of. The additional offence of secondary liability for manslaughter must become  an integral part of the new legislation.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  I have received one amendment to the motion, which is published on the  Marshalled List of Amendments.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">I beg to move the following amendment: At end insert:</p>
<p align="left" class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;; furthermore this legislation should apply to all  employers, including government agencies and, in keeping with this principle,  this Assembly calls for the removal of Crown immunity from prosecution.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">I welcome the debate, although I regret that, once again,  we are discussing an important issue on which the Assembly is powerless to act.  This matter, along with water charges, health, education, rates and so on,  would be better addressed by locally accountable Ministers in our own Assembly.  I believe that all those issues will eventually be addressed by an Assembly  because the political will clearly exists. I welcome the fact that across all  the Benches there are those who recognise the need for a locally accountable  Executive to respond to those important issues. I hope that between us we will  resolve, through direct dialogue, the few remaining issues so that an Executive  can function in future.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">I propose the amendment, as it supports and strengthens the  motion. I strongly identify with and appreciate Mr Gardiner&rsquo;s motion and the  arguments that he made in support of it. However, the amendment addresses some  of the deficiencies in the Westminster Bill, which is substandard in important  respects, as Mr Gardiner mentioned. It  fails to address comprehensively work-related deaths in many  circumstances.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">My amendment addresses the anomaly of Crown immunity from  prosecution. In the interests of justice and equality, as well as of workplace  safety, this must be abolished. An employee of Government agencies, or his or  her dependants, should be afforded the same duty of care as any other employee  in any other sector of the economy. Therefore we would best serve those whom we  represent by working on solutions that would remove the privileges and  anomalies in the system and deliver  equality of protection to all workers.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">In the 12-month period to March 2005, 88 people lost their  lives in work-related accidents in Ireland; 73 in the South and 15 in the  North. Since most of those deaths and injuries occurred in the construction  industry, and given the numbers of construction workers who travel to sites  throughout the island, this issue must be addressed on an all-island basis. A  definition of work-related deaths and injuries should be developed that takes  that into account.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Another important issue arises from the methods of  calculating the statistics of work-related fatalities and injuries. The Services,  Industrial, Professional and Technical Union (SIPTU) has warned that the number  of work-related fatalities could be 10 times higher than is reported. For  example, SIPTU has pointed out that occupational fatality statistics do not  include the deaths of employees who are killed in road traffic accidents while  driving as part of their normal employment. However, statistics tell us that up  to one third of all road accidents are work-related.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Likewise, illnesses contracted at work that can lead to  fatalities outside the workplace are not included in work-related statistics.  For example, workplace-related cancers such as asbestosis, which are  particularly high in the North, are not recorded. In addition, non-fatal  work-related illnesses and injuries can cause serious deterioration in the  quality of life, including, in some <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">cases,  disruption of ability to participate in the work&shy;force,</span> or reduced life  expectancy. The absence of statistics on such illnesses and injuries shows that  they are not being treated with the seriousness that they deserve.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">A Cheann Comhairle, the important point to make is that  nearly all such work-related illnesses, injuries and deaths are preventable,  provided that proper safety regimes are in place and are implemented with due  diligence. Employers stand to benefit from measures that reduce workplace  injuries, illness and stress, so it is hard to understand why employers&rsquo;  organisations continue to resist measures that would improve health and safety.  Such benefits would include improved productivity  due to lower rates of sickness, absenteeism and staff turnover, and  improved recruitment and retention of trained staff.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in does not believe that there is any acceptable  excuse when employers fail to meet worker health and safety standards and  obligations under the law. My party wants the establishment of a universal,  all-island commission on health, welfare and safety at work, which is centrally  involved with the Health and Safety Authority (HSA) in the South and the Health  and Safety Executive (HSE) in the North. We want the initiation of an  all-island workplace health strategy to reduce and remove all aspects of ill  health that arise from unsafe work practices. We want immediate steps to be  taken in order to tackle the shortage of health and safety inspectors, as that  has been identified as a major factor that hinders the authorities&rsquo; ability to  carry out inspection and enforce&shy;ment functions. That would obviously require  the injection of additional resources to enable the HSE to fulfil its  responsibilities under strengthened workplace health and safety legislation.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">The provision of Government grant aid for sectoral trade-union safety training would be another  progressive step. Sinn F&eacute;in wants there to be a legal obligation for  employers to agree a programme of general health and safety training with the  HSE that would meet specific requirements  depending on the substances and processes used in the workplace. The  introduction of mandatory safety training, which new employees could take on <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">full pay, would also contribute significantly to  improving</span> health and safety statistics.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">The introduction of legislation that obliges employers to  notify the HSE of any events that occur at their place of work, including  exposure to noxious substances that result in workers&rsquo; absence for more than  three consecutive days, is comparable to existing legislation and to  regulations in other European economies. Such legislation would provide greater  accountability and reassurance that such issues would be dealt with. Finally, I  ask for support for the conclusion of an international convention against  asbestos production and use.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Let us make no mistake: work-related death through lack of  proper safety measures or employer negligence is a crime. There is widespread  support across the political spectrum for many of the changes that have been  proposed in the legislation on the accountability of companies. However, there  would be further support for those changes if sufficient thought and attention  were given to the accountability of company owners and directors. Furthermore,  even if those issues were comprehensively addressed, it is not proposed that  they would be applied in the North of Ireland. Why not? Do workers here not  deserve the same entitlement to protection? The motion allows the Assembly to  state clearly that it believes that they do.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">The Westminster Bill&rsquo;s proposed changes, which provide Crown agencies with immunity from  prosecution for the offence of corporate killing, should form no part of  any legislation that applies to workers&rsquo; rights legislation here. All bodies,  Government or corporate, should be liable to prosecution if culpability or  neglect can be proven. The proposer of the motion has highlighted that.  Corporate manslaughter legislation is already in place in many economies and in  many countries. It has proved to be a key tool in the battle to reduce  workplace accidents and fatalities.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">I ask Members to support the amendment. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith  agat.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  support the motion, but not the amendment. The proposer of the amendment has  raised a few issues that must be corrected for the sake of the record. He said  that the Assembly is powerless to act on this important issue, but it seems as  though the lack of power and will is coming from the Member&rsquo;s party, not the  Assembly. His party has failed abysmally to do anything in the past few weeks  or months &mdash; years, even &mdash; to convince my community and the people of Northern  Ireland that it is in any way interested in having a peaceful, stable and  prosperous Northern Ireland. The proposals and actions of that party are always  minimalist.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">The proposer of the amendment said that he wants the amendment  to be accepted in the interests of justice and equality. He also said that  negligence is a crime. Does he accept that &mdash;</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  On a point of order, Madam Speaker. Will you rule on the relevance of the  Member&rsquo;s comments to the motion and the amendment?</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  Thank you, Mr O&rsquo;Dowd. I will allow Mr Storey to continue, but I will listen to  how he develops his remarks.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">The proposer of the amendment said that negligence is a  crime. I take issue with that. Does he accept that the murder of Jean  McConville was also a crime, as it was quite clear that &mdash;</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  Order. Mr Storey, those comments are not relevant to the motion. Please keep to  the motion. Corporate manslaughter is a serious subject, and I would be  grateful if you would confine your remarks to the motion.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Madam Speaker, my comments relating to the contribution of the proposer of the  amendment are also serious, and they will be recorded as such.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">I support the motion. As one who worked for almost 20 years  in industry before becoming involved in politics full time, I saw at first hand  the unfortunate situation where employers take a cavalier attitude towards  their responsibilities. Anyone who has responsibility for employees owes them the  most common and acceptable protection possible, so that the utmost protection  is provided in all circumstances.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">The statistics quoted by the hon Member Mr Gardiner are  regrettable. The Assembly would be doing a disservice to the people of Northern  Ireland if Members somehow allowed the debating of this issue to be seen as an  opportunity for them to merely salve their consciences and show their concern,  rather than as an opportunity to make appropriate responses to the issues that  are prevalent in society.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Look at the statistics that the hon Member quoted. There is  a concern that we all bear responsibility. As Mr Gardiner proposes, there  should be an offence of corporate manslaughter where it can be proven that  culpable negligence by a firm is a major contributory factor in the death of an  employee. That is a key element of the motion.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">All Members should come to the Assembly with a sense of  duty and responsibility. If Members are serious in their concern for the  proposal, they will support the motion and impress their concerns upon the  Government &mdash; a Government who appear to be cavalier in their attitudes towards  the safety of their citizens with regard to security and the roads  infrastructure.</p>
<p align="left" class="TimePeriod">11.00 am</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">The proposal to reduce the finance for our roads by 40% or  50% will undoubtedly lead to a continual decline in, and deterioration of, the  roads infrastructure. That results in accidents and deaths on the roads for  which the authorities take no responsibility. I support the motion.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>: I welcome the motion, the amendment, and the thoughtful  speeches from their proposers. First, we must put the problem into context: it  is estimated that businesses, commercial enterprises or companies may have had  some culpability in between 250 and 300 deaths since 1999. However, only five  people and five businesses have been found guilty of any criminal act. As  Samuel Gardiner pointed out, there are, on a pro rata basis, some 20 deaths a  year in the North, and that is a significant problem.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Today, we should be trying to work out a legislative  approach that deals with those 250 deaths in which there is corporate  responsibility. I cite the incident at Zeebrugge,  which was a very public example of corporate failure; the issues around the death of Victoria Climbi&eacute;; the  death of Jean Charles de Menezes; and the deaths at Deepcut Barracks.  Legislation must deal with cases of great public concern when a corporate  enterprise, a business or public body, has  failed in its standard of care to the individual. We need to work out a  law that will address the problems that  were identified in the cases of Victoria Climbi&eacute;, Jean Charles de  Menezes and others, including deaths in the North over the past 30 years in  which there was corporate failure by public bodies.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">The problem with the legislation resides in two areas. As  Mr Gardiner pointed out, if a prosecution for corporate failure is to succeed,  the standards of proof applied to businesses  must be properly established. Mr McLaughlin identified the second  problem: how far does Crown immunity extend in the legislation? It extends far  beyond what the Assembly, the House of Commons or the House of Lords should  accept.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">If there were another killing like that of Victoria  Climbi&eacute;, the question arises whether a public body that had contributed to her  death could be prosecuted under this legislation. The argument is uncertain,  because, as Mr Gardiner pointed out, a  successful prosecution could not be brought in that case, or  high-profile cases in this jurisdiction,  because the standards of proof are too high.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">The standard of proof should be stated as: &ldquo;beyond  reasonable doubt&rdquo;, or &ldquo;in the balance of probabilities&rdquo;, or another standard  that is close to either of those; but not the standard of falling:</p>
<p align="left" class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;far below what can be reasonably expected&rdquo;.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">To prove a case against a public body or business, the  plaintiff must demonstrate a failure to comply with health and welfare  requirements or, as Mr Gardiner pointed out, that the manager sought to profit  from a failure to uphold appropriate standards or that there had been a gross  breach of the relevant duty of care.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">When a case is brought to the Public Prosecution Service in  the North, or before the courts in any jurisdiction in these islands, trying to  meet those standards in a hard case will be so demanding as to inevitably lead  to failure. The second part of Mr Gardiner&rsquo;s motion is important because it  aims to moderate those very exacting standards of proof in a way that creates  some possibility whereby a public body or private enterprise may become  vulnerable to prosecution.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">The standards set by the Bill, if it passes, are so exacting and demanding that prospects of a  prosecution in many &mdash; or even a few &mdash; of the 250 deaths that will arise  over the next four or five years, is slim to the point of being negligible.  Great public debate will arise around cases of public concern following the  failure to successfully prosecute those who  should be responsible before the law.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">The second issue with  which there are major problems is highlighted in the amendment proposed  by Mitchel McLaughlin, which concerns the question of where Crown immunity begins and ends. Although the  original draft of the Bill addressed  Crown immunity and provided that persons in the Police Service of  Northern Ireland or in other public bodies that are involved in the  administration of law and justice might be subject to a corporate charge, the  Bill has subsequently been amended by the British Government in a damaging and  fatal way. I shall provide three examples.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">There are additional draft exemptions in the legislation  proposed by the British Government that provide a blanket exemption for deaths  of civilians caused by the gross negligence of the police or others &mdash; such as  the intelligence services and MI5 &mdash; in the performance of policing or law  enforcement activities.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Moreover, there will be an exemption for the killing of  members of the public that occurs in situations of terror, civil unrest or  serious public disorder in which the police come under attack or face the  threat of attack or violent resistance.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">I ask Members to apply those circumstances to some of the  tragic cases in the North&rsquo;s history. Apply them even in cases in which the  police have come under attack, subject to threat and terrible violence, and  where, nevertheless, a police officer or commander committed a grave error that  led to the death of an individual. Those exemptions would allow that police  officer, in criminal terms &mdash; or the police service, in corporate terms &mdash; to  walk away. All Members know of cases involving use of force by the police or  the military, or cases with MI5 involvement, which gave rise to public concern.  All of those matters will, in all likelihood,  be exempted under the proposed legislation. That is the importance of  the amendment proposed by Mitchel McLaughlin.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">I know that it will be difficult to reach cross-party  consensus on such an issue. However, Members should try to do that today.  During sittings of the Committee on the Preparation for Government this summer,  a significant event happened. On 23 August 2006, all of the parties that were  represented on that Committee, including the  Alliance Party, agreed the following motion:</p>
<p align="left" class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;That the Committee calls on the Government to review  policy on the publication of reasons where there has been a failure to  prosecute and the collapse of prosecutions&rdquo;.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Two or three years ago, that would not have happened  because there was then a sense that the prosecutors and the state know best.  There was a sense that, if a case collapsed or did not proceed, there must be a  good reason.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Things changed due to concern within unionist parties about  the collapse of the Stormontgate case and because of the subsequent failure by  the Attorney-General and the PPS to give adequate reasons for the collapse. The  public concern that arose from the failure to explain why that case collapsed  led to all parties agreeing to communicate to the British Government that the  issue was one of cross-party concern.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Members should accept the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment, not because  it will lead to open season on the state and its agencies, but because it will  limit the power of the state to walk away from issues of public concern that  involve lethal force.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  I now call Francie Brolly. This will be the first occasion that Assembly will  hear from Mr Brolly, who will be making what  can be described as his maiden speech. As Members know, it is the con-vention that such a speech is made without  interruption.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brolly</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. My father was a strong  nationalist and a significant member of the old Nationalist Party. As a young child, I got to know all the nationalist  luminaries of the time, who were regular visitors to our house in  Limavady &mdash; a house that at times served as a party office as much as it did a  home. My father was a tireless political activist; his bedtime reading was the  electoral registers and the minutes, motions and agendas of Limavady Rural  District Council and Derry County Council, on both of which he was a  long-serving member.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">When we moved to our native Dungiven, he became the  secretary of the local GAA club. Concerned about the level of unemployment in  Dungiven, he initiated a drive for the building of what was then called an  advance factory. He went on to persuade Desmonds textile manufacturers to set  up in the village. As people round our way say, &ldquo; He was in everything but the  crib&rdquo;.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">In 1970, he was a foreman on a housing scheme in  Lettershandony. I was teaching in Dungiven at the time. On the morning of 23  February, the local curate came to my classroom door and motioned me out. &ldquo;Your  father has had an accident at work&rdquo;, he said. &ldquo;Bad?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Bad&rdquo;, he said.  And it was very bad &mdash; my father was dead. He had gone down into a 15-ft-deep  unshored trench to organise pipe-laying. The trench collapsed, and he was  buried alive.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">A radio broadcast that evening said that a worker had died  as a result of an accident on a building site; &ldquo;a worker&rdquo; &mdash; as if a man is no  more than his job description.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">When jobs were scarce, work was paramount. Workmen were  plentiful, exploitable and expendable. My mother was pitifully compensated, and  the company was told not to let it happen again. Nothing much has changed.  People still die at their places of work, and employers still escape any  fitting and proportionate sanction. In 2005, only 40 employers in the  Twenty-six Counties were prosecuted for breaches of health and safety  regulations. The average fine was approximately &pound;8,000.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">My mother&rsquo;s compensation was &pound;7,000. I suppose the  assessors thought that &pound;7,000 was a lot of money for her in 1970.</p>
<p align="left" class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">A mere six employers were penalised in the Six Counties in  2004-05. The largest fine imposed was &pound;100,000 against Farrans (Construction)  Ltd following the death of a 20-year-old who was electrocuted. Was &pound;100,000 a  lot of money for Farrans (Construction) Ltd in 2004?</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">No Irish employer has served a day in prison for criminal  negligence resulting in the death of an em-ployee. This prompts me to recommend  the establish-ment of an Irish commission on health, welfare and safety at  work, especially at this time when there is such a high level of employee  mobility throughout the Thirty-two Counties, particularly in the construction  industry.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">While supporting the  substantive motion strongly and absolutely, I am concerned about the  title &ldquo;corporate manslaughter&rdquo; and, therefore, about the concept of corporate  guilt. As long as company directors are not made personally amenable to the  law, but can shelter under the umbrella of corporate culpability, we will not  have the issue of safety at work tackled with the urgency and the thorough  commitment that would be the desired outcome of the motion and amendment. A few  months in jail would concentrate the mind of a careless employer.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">To finish, I will digress a little and make a plea to all  Members here. Thousands of people genuinely sympathised with me on the death of  my father. However, some whom I knew bore a grudge against members of his  employer&rsquo;s family and would have used my father&rsquo;s tragedy as a stick to beat  them with. My personal experience would not allow me to use any victim of any  tragedy to make cheap political points. Let us, in the spirit of the motion,  look after our living in the home, on the streets and in the workplace, and let  the dead rest in peace.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  The next Member to speak, Mr Davy Hyland, will make the winding-up speech on  the amendment. This is the first occasion on which he will have addressed the  Assembly, so he will be making his maiden speech.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hyland</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Last week P J Bradley referred to his cold. Today I have a  cold and a sore back, and I hope that it is not due to the arctic conditions  that we endured yesterday in the Assembly. Maybe Members saved some taxpayers&rsquo;  money by cutting down the fuel bills. However, it is more likely that old age  is setting in, as I have to use my reading glasses.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Christmas is traditionally a time of celebration, family  reunions and giving and receiving presents &mdash; a holiday time when one can  overindulge in food and drink and not feel too guilty about it. However, it is  also a time of reflection when the previous 12 months can be reviewed &mdash; the  highs and lows, the good times and the bad.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">For some people, Christmas can be a sad period when they  remember their loved ones who are no longer with them. It is a particularly  difficult time for families who have lost loved ones because of unnecessary  accidents at home, on the roads, or in the workplace. Sinn F&eacute;in supports the  motion because too many people have been injured or have lost their lives  through work-related accidents.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Yesterday, a delegation of firemen sat in the Gallery. On  seeing them, I remembered the two firemen who lost their lives tragically last  week while dealing with an explosion in a fireworks factory in England.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">In 2005, 73 people lost their lives in work-related  incidents in the Twenty-six Counties, which was a 30% increase on the previous  year. There were 15 work-related deaths in the Six Counties in the 12-month  period to March 2005 &mdash; a total of 88 in the whole country.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">The construction industry remains the most dangerous  industry for employees. In the Twenty-six Counties, 23 construction workers  died in 2005. Thirty years ago, after finishing university, I took a job as a  brickie&rsquo;s labourer on a building site in Newry. The foreman was called Dominic  Craven. Unfortunately, there are parallels with Francie&rsquo;s case; we were working  on a new Housing Executive development in Newry, which necessitated the  building of trenches. Dominic was a man who was not afraid to get his hands  dirty and work in the trenches, yet one collapsed and he was killed instantly.  Afterwards, I wondered why no public inquiry was held into his unnecessary  death, or, indeed, why was there no public apology from the firm? Perhaps an  apology would have implied guilt on the firm&rsquo;s part. I wondered also if his  wife was compensated adequately for her suffering and loss.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Illnesses contracted at work can also lead to work-related  fatalities outside the workplace. Work-related cancers caused by working  conditions in the linen and shipbuilding industries in the North have always  been particularly high.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">The important point to recognise is that many such  work-related illnesses, injuries and deaths are preventable, provided that the  employer exercises due diligence. Indeed, the Health and Safety Executive  Northern Ireland (HSENI) estimates that up to 70% of deaths in the workplace  are the result of serious management failures.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Ultimately, companies are not responsible for killing  workers; it is people. Fatalities in the workplace are avoidable and are often  caused by fundamental safety shortcomings  throughout an organisation, the blame for which can be properly laid at  the door of the chairman, chief executive and board of directors as  appropriate.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Many employers who are responsible for dangerous working conditions  are never held accountable, nor made to change their practices. As with other  laws relating to workers rights in Ireland, health and safety legislation is rarely enforced, and penalties for  violations are not strong enough. As Francie Brolly pointed out, no  Irish employer has ever served a prison sentence following the death of a  worker.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work  Act 2005 in the Twenty-six Counties, which contains significant increases in  fines and penalties to deter non-compliant employers. However, fines are not  enough when an act of negligence leads to a worker&rsquo;s death. Corporate killing  is a crime, and corporate manslaughter legislation exits in other  jurisdictions. For example, in Canada, Bill C-45, better known as the Westray  Bill, provides for the crime of corporate killing. It was enacted following  agitation in response to the Westray explosion in Nova Scotia, which killed 26  miners.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">On a more positive note, Sinn F&eacute;in feels that an  all-Ireland commission on health, welfare and safety at work, should involve  both the Health and Safety Authority (HSA) and HSENI. A 10-year, all-Ireland  workplace health strategy to reduce and remove all aspects of ill health  arising from unsafe work practices would be beneficial. We should tackle the  shortage of health and safety inspectors in the Six Counties and Twenty-six  Counties immediately, as that shortage has been identified as a factor  hindering the ability of the authorities to carry out their inspection and  enforcement functions.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, sufficient resources must be injected into  both HSA and HSENI to enable them to fulfil all their responsibilities under  existing worker health and safety legislation.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">We also support grant-aided safety training for trade  unions on a sectoral basis.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Yesterday, Peter Hain &mdash; sorry, that was a Freudian slip &mdash;  Peter Weir talked about the importance of cross-party support in opposition to  the closure of fire stations in the North. I welcome the fact that all parties  in the Assembly are today united to defend the rights of ordinary men and women  in their workplace. It is right to  highlight the offence of corporate manslaughter and the need for  legislation to be introduced in the North of Ireland.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Culpability is a  difficult subject. No one would like to be accused of responsibility for  another person&rsquo;s death, but companies and firms are ultimately answerable for  the safety and well-being of their workforces. That must be the clear message  from this Assembly.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>: Today&rsquo;s debate has been important, not simply because worker  protection is an important matter in itself, but also because this Assembly can  be seen to be debating a bread-and-butter issue that affects the everyday life  of working people, and not simply occupying itself with what has been described  in other quarters as a high-wire act. It is important that the electorate  perceive that the Assembly works in their interests and on their behalf.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Seeking to put  legislation in place that secures higher standards of safety in the workplace is an appropriate and  important matter for us to consider. As the Member for Upper Bann Mr Gardiner  said, legislation to create the offence of corporate manslaughter, which will  apply to Northern Ireland as well as other parts of the United Kingdom, is  already making progress through the House of Commons.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Though some industries are taking the improvement of safety  standards seriously, and with a degree of success, more remains to be done to  reduce the current levels of workplace injuries and fatalities. It is to be  hoped that today&rsquo;s debate will inform the legislators in Westminster and get  them to reconsider the issue of secondary liability for corporate manslaughter,  which we believe &mdash; and as has been illustrated in today&rsquo;s debate &mdash; will create  the deterrent factor necessary to focus minds on the need to ensure close  adherence to health and safety considerations in the workplace.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">That that deterrent factor is necessary is all too obvious,  and we have had some graphic illustrations of the impact on families by Members  who have spoken today. Mr Gardiner drew attention to the fact that the rate of  fatalities from industrial accidents in Northern Ireland is twice what we could  expect on a pro rata comparison with GB. That points to the need for a more robust  culture of industrial and worker safety than currently prevails in Northern  Ireland.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">The essential building block and foundation for that new  culture has to be a corporate manslaughter Bill &mdash; one that has teeth. If the  Bill&rsquo;s deterrent factor is inadequate, the whole exercise will be a waste of  time. The drafters of the legislation at Westminster have had grave difficulty in producing a Bill that  incorporates the wide range of  concerns expressed in the Chamber today.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">In some ways, the new legislation will lead to the  abandonment of the current legislative position. At present, the prosecution of individuals has to take place before  action against a corporation or employer is even possible. The proposed new  legislation enables the prosecution of the corporation or employer immediately,  subject to decision by the Director of the Public Prosecution Service. In some  ways, the baby has been thrown out with the bath water.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">In its anxiety to make  the prosecution of corporations easier, Parliament has ignored the aspect  of individual accountability that is involved in any industrial fatality. I  concur with Mr Gardiner that the culpability of individuals within  corporations, companies, and Government Departments and agencies is important.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">The matter of Crown immunity has been referred to in the  proposed amendment. There is now a step forward and a recognition in the  legislation currently before Parliament that Crown immunity, as a principle, is  being breached. I appeal to the mover of the amendment to recognise that, so  that the House can unite around the original proposal in order to show the public, the employers and the Westminster  Government that we are serious about the matter. We recognise that they  have at least breached the principle of Crown immunity in this first instance.  Perhaps we can deal with the remaining issues at a later stage.</p>
<p align="left" class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Government agencies can now be made individually and  personally accountable in some way, and the issue of industrial safety will now  be taken seriously. Clause 16 of the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate  Homicide Bill currently proposes that any individual working for a corporation,  Government Department, agency or body be expressly excluded from the Bill&rsquo;s  operation. It states:</p>
<p align="left" class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;(1) An individual cannot be guilty of aiding,  abetting, counselling or procuring the commission of an offence of corporate  manslaughter.</p>
<p align="left" class="Q1QuoteIndented">(2) An individual cannot be guilty of aiding,  abetting, counselling or procuring, or being art and part in, the commission of  an offence of corporate homicide.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">The Assembly must speak out about that serious flaw in the  Bill currently going through Parliament. In particular, I ask those MLAs who  are also Members of the Westminster Parliament to take that message back to the  House of Commons. Members must do so on behalf of the families of the 20 or  more people who have died each year from industrial injuries.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Members have heard highly personal descriptions of such  cases. The descriptions went beyond the fact that a worker has been killed in  an industrial incident as broadcast on radio, to the impact on the family left behind. The hurt and the pain for that family do  not end <span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt; ">with the broadcast: they  continue, perhaps for generations.</span></p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">The only way in which to re-introduce personal  accountability is to introduce a related and dependent offence of secondary  liability for corporate man&shy;slaughter. In practice, the UUP envisages that that  would work by requiring juries to establish whether management failure had  caused, or contributed to, the death in question. On the basis of that finding,  the DPP would determine whether individuals in a company should be prosecuted  for the manslaughter, in addition to the prosecution of the company, corporation  or agency involved. That would give the new corporate manslaughter legislation  a necessary cutting edge and would underpin it with a deterrent impact &mdash; both  of which are currently lacking.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">There is no question that the corporate manslaughter  deterrent effect is necessary. Year after year, the construction industry is  one of the worst offenders in relation to industrial injuries and fatalities. I  will not bore the House with the figures now, but in Northern Ireland injury  rates remain stubbornly high, whereas in GB they have consistently dropped over  the last four or five years. It is possible, therefore, to make inroads into  those figures, providing everyone accepts that the safety measure of a  corporate manslaughter deterrent must be introduced.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Between January and October this year, as many people were  killed in the construction industry as in the whole of 2000: there has hardly  been great progress. The fact that the record for industrial deaths in Northern  Ireland is markedly poorer than that in GB must be a cause for concern and for  action.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Let us anchor that in the report of a tragedy that was  reported by the media in the past week. It was reported that the Water Service  in Northern Ireland had been held responsible for the death of a contractor who  was killed in an explosion at a treatment works last year. A Crown censure  hearing was held following an investigation by the Health and Safety Executive.  The Water Service accepted the censure and presented to the hearing information  on measures that it had put in place since the blast to prevent it happening  again.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Crown censure is an administrative procedure followed by  the Health and Safety Executive in circumstances where a case cannot be taken  to a court of law because of Crown immunity from prosecution. Under the  proposed corporate manslaughter law, the Water Service would almost certainly  have been brought to trial for that offence. Therefore, one positive aspect of  the proposed legislation is that Crown immunity has been breached for the first  time.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">However, there is concern about industrial deaths and  accidents across Europe. A study of comparative industrial death rates in  Sweden and Denmark showed that the levels are much lower in Sweden. Perhaps  that reflects the fact that there are lengthy periods of apprenticeship in  Sweden, during which significant time is spent ensuring that health and safety  issues are to the fore, whereas in Denmark much more is learned on the job and on site. Therefore, major issues  of training and health and safety awareness must be addressed.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">In 2000, a building contractor in Spain was sentenced to 18  months&rsquo; imprisonment following an industrial accident that led to the death of  a worker. The court ruled that that contractor had committed homicide by failing to fulfil health and safety  obligations.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">It is also worth pointing out that, as they were going  through a building boom in Spain, the numbers of deaths and injuries on  building sites increased dramatically. That is something that we need to bear  in mind. We too are going through a building boom, so it is particularly  important that we address these issues quickly.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">I am running out of time, unfortunately. We can see that we  are dealing with a western European problem. I had hoped to refer to several of  the contributions made by Members, but time is against me. In general, there  has been great support across the Chamber. I repeat my appeal to the Member who  moved the amendment to look again at that so that we can move forward as a  united body in support of the motion.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText"><span class="Italic">Question put,</span> That the amendment  be made.</p>

<p align="left" class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls upon the Government to introduce  legislation introducing the offence of corporate manslaughter to Northern  Ireland, where it could be proven that culpable negligence by a firm was a  major contributory factor to the death of an employee or subcontracted worker;  and further calls for the introduction of an additional offence of secondary  liability for corporate manslaughter, where it could be shown that a company&rsquo;s  failings were provably caused by the culpable negligence of one or more  individuals within the firm.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  Members will know that the Business Committee has arranged that the next debate  will commence at &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Order. I am on my feet, and I am speaking. It seems,  however, that Members intend to leave the Chamber anyway.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Members will know that the Business Committee has arranged  that the next debate will commence at 2.00 pm.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyTextItalic">The sitting was suspended at 11.49 am.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyTextItalic">On resuming (Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Wells] in the  Chair) &mdash;</p>
<p align="left" class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
<p align="left" class="H4StageHeading">Police College</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has allowed two hours for the debate. The  Member who moves the motion will have 15 minutes to speak, and all the other  Members will have 10 minutes.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
<p align="left" class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls upon the Government to provide the  necessary funding to allow a new police college to be built in Northern  Ireland.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">The new &pound;130 million facility will encompass a site of more  than 200 acres. It was supposed to have been completed by next year, but it is  now almost two years behind schedule. As well as the annual intake of new  recruits, serving officers would also heavily use it. It could also be shared  by other police services, not just in the British Isles, but further afield.  Fire Service investigators, ambulance response teams, bank staff and domestic  violence specialists could also avail of the new facility.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">The present college at Garnerville is completely  unsatisfactory. Indeed, Deputy Chief Constable Paul Leighton admitted yesterday  that trainees currently have little more than a telephone box around which to  simulate incidents.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Everyone with the best  interests of first class policing at heart wants a new purpose built  college that will provide a world-class training facility. Even Chris Patten,  many of whose views my party does not endorse, said and I quote:</p>
<p align="left" class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Northern Ireland  police should have a new purpose-built police college and the funding for it  should be found in the next public spending round.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">That, of course, was several years ago. That sentiment was  further emphasised in a report from the Oversight Commissioner, who recognised  that the training, education and development of police officers and civilian  staff is crucial to the success of policing.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">More and more people from Northern Ireland and beyond are choosing  policing as a career. Setting aside, for the moment, the current disgraceful  and discrim-inatory recruitment practices to the policing service, the PSNI is  dedicated to serving the entire community and making life here safer for  everyone. All existing staff who require ongoing training deserve the highest  quality training in the best possible environment. They also deserve the  support of all the political represent-atives of all the political parties in  Northern Ireland.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">The new college will enable us to bring together police  training in a single, purpose built, world-class facility and allow us to build  connections with other police services across the globe.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">After the negative reputation this country endured  throughout the decades of terrorism here, we have an opportunity for Northern  Ireland to become renowned internationally for something positive, but the  Government are dithering. Resources were promised for this college, and a  previous Northern Ireland Grand Committee, a body that has met just this  afternoon in Belfast for the first time &mdash;</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  Thank you. I have just left it in order to be here.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">At a previous meeting the former Northern Ireland Minister,  Jane Kennedy MP, said, and I quote:</p>
<p align="left" class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I can confirm that  the delays to the project have been due primarily to difficulties associated  with identifying a site and those difficulties are now being overcome. There is  no problem regarding resources&hellip;..the availability of finances is not a problem;  the development of the project has been the problem, and I hope that we can now  bring this matter swiftly to a conclusion.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">When pressed further on the funding of the project, by my  party leader, Dr Ian Paisley, Mrs Kennedy went on to say:</p>
<p align="left" class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I hope that the hon.  Gentleman will accept my reassurance that on Patten&rsquo;s recommendations regarding  the policing college, resources are not the issue. The problem is getting the  plan to its final stages and carrying it through to completion; and I hope to  see that happen very rapidly.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">We are nearing the end of 2006, and building has not yet  commenced. Therefore, we appear to be little further on.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">In passing, I shall speak to the SDLP amendment. Cookstown  may be the location for the college, and if so, we should all support that. If  not, obviously the Northern Ireland Policing Board will seek out the location  that is the next most suitable. However, I am sure that other Members will  campaign on behalf of their individual localities. For example, I contend  strongly that the Army camp at Ballykelly, with its excellent topography, road  links and proximity to an airport, is an excellent location. Nonetheless, I  digress.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">The key is to get the go-ahead and the resources to build  the college. David Nairn of the Police College of Northern Ireland stated that  the college should provide training and education of the highest quality for  all police staff. He also said that:</p>
<p align="left" class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The unparalleled  expertise we hold places us at the forefront of specialist operational training  in the United Kingdom. We are undoubtedly best placed to offer our knowledge to  both public and private sector organisations and police services across Great  Britain and Republic of Ireland. Having accumulated a wealth of operational  experience through policing in Northern Ireland, I believe our training  provision is truly unique and pioneering.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">That is undoubtedly the case; however, we need the full  resources in order to complete the job. An organisation that seeks to deliver a  first-class service needs first-class facilities. A state-of-the-art college  will provide untold opportunities for Northern Ireland. Government must act  immediately to unlock that potential.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I have received one amendment to the motion, which is published on  the Marshalled List of Amendments.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  I beg to move the following amendment: Leave out &ldquo;Northern Ireland&rdquo; and insert  &ldquo;Cookstown, Desertcreat site&rdquo;.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">A LeasCheann Comhairle, I appreciate that that specific  detail in regard to location is the only difference between the amendment and  the substantive motion. Mr Campbell has clarified his position on that point,  and I thank him for doing so.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">For that reason, I submit the following matters of fact for  inclusion in the Official Report of this debate. Recommendation 131 of the  Patten Report stated that:</p>
<p align="left" class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Northern Ireland  police should have a new purpose-built police college and the funding for it  should be found in the next public spending round.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Following detailed and open competition in the search for a  site, the police college project board recommended that the new site for the  college should be Desertcreat, outside Cookstown. The Deputy Chief Constable  chairs that board, which comprises other members of the PSNI, the Policing  Board and representatives of the Northern Ireland Office. It is also supported  by a team of external consultants. All sites that were submitted were fully  evaluated and were visited prior to that recommendation being made to the  entire Policing Board in February 2004. On the basis of the business case that  was submitted in support of the Cookstown site, the decision of the board was,  and remains, unanimous.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">In July 2005, outline planning permission was granted for  the site. The Chief Constable supported recently, publicly and fully the  decision to progress with that site. The site has now been formally transferred  from the ownership of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development to  that of the Policing Board at, I am reliably informed, a relatively modest  cost.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">At a meeting with the Policing Board on 10 October 2006,  the Secretary of State confirmed that Cookstown remains the site for the  college, and he gave assurances about the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to  the project.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">From my correspondence with the board, I am aware that the  site has further potential for the Fire and Rescue Service, which is currently  also assessing its requirements for a firefighters&rsquo; training college.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">It makes sense for the emergency services to share facilities at one location. Indeed, there would  be further opportunities for training for other emergency and police  services both on the island of Ireland, from Britain and from other countries.  First, however, it is high time that the Government committed to proper  resources for a new, state-of-the-art police college to provide the foundation  to the new start to policing itself. Instead of dithering and allowing  construction and related costs to rise, which they have already done, the  Government should get on with the work and commit to this project.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Molaim an leas&uacute;. I commend the amendment to the House. Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Kelly</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Sinn F&eacute;in believes that police  training is an indispensable part of changing the culture and ethos of  policing. That change is essential in order to achieve the new beginning to  policing that was enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement and for which our  party and our community continue to strive.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">The RUC was a paramilitary, sectarian force born out of the  turmoil of partition and drawn, in the main, from the UVF of the time. It was a  partisan, state, political police force.  Thirty years of conflict reinforced that mindset and behaviour. The  problem was high-lighted in the Patten Report, which was published in 1999 &mdash;  and I thank Gregory Campbell for quoting the Patten recommendations &mdash; and which  states:</p>
<p align="left" class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Human rights training in the RUC also lags behind  other police organizations we have spoken to. In the new curriculum (introduced  only this year), of 700 sessions of training there are only 2 sessions  dedicated to human rights, compared with 40 of drill and 63 of firearms training&rdquo;.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is why we need a new beginning to policing,  and Sinn F&eacute;in has been and still is working hard to secure this.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">We need a new beginning for many reasons, not least because  there is still a gun culture in the PSNI. In the recent past, we have witnessed  PSNI members shooting up tyres of articulated lorries on the Falls Road and  driving on motorbikes and firing into vehicles that they believed to be stolen.  Worst of all, in 2003 Neil McConville was shot dead by the PSNI during a  pre-planned operation.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">The NIHRC, in the  introduction to its report, &lsquo;Human Rights in Police Training, Report  Four: Course for All&rsquo;, published in 2004, states:</p>
<p align="left" class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Our evaluation  concludes that although the course complied with the requirements of the Patten  Report to a certain extent, it did contain some weaknesses from a human rights  perspective. The Commission has therefore framed its recommendations to take  account of the fact that the <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">Course  for All </span></span>will not run again.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">The report found that, for example, participants displayed  sexist, racist and sectarian attitudes and that, generally, tutors did not  intervene to explore or to challenge.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">It also states:</p>
<p align="left" class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Human rights and  equality were not accorded a sufficiently central place in the course.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">We have some distance yet to go to achieve a new beginning  to policing, and central to that, of course, is the transfer of powers at the  earliest moment. I want a police training college where no one is trained in  the use of plastic bullets; I want a college where the Irish national flag is  given the same respect and prominence as any other national flag; I do not want  a place where police learn to arrest people simply because they speak Irish; I  want a police training college where the new recruits are not coached in how to  break down the front door of a family home at 5.00 am and maraud through it  with semi-automatic weapons, while the occupants, including children, are  verbally abused and terrorised.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">If the proposers of this motion seek a new police training  college to expunge those human rights violations from policing then it is more  than welcome. If an end to the practices I have described is facilitated or  helped by the creation of a new police training college, it cannot come quickly  enough. If it helps to facilitate a new beginning to policing, which is  enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement and which Sinn F&eacute;in is determined to  deliver, then bring it on. However, if this debate is about who gets to have a  high-profile development in their backyard, the public will see through that.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">We know from places such as Palace Barracks that it is not  the building that has been the problem in the past; it is what went on inside  the building. Indeed, it is rather like the problem of what used to go on  inside this Building in the golden era of the old Stormont apartheid regime.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">The British Government should release the funds to build a  new police college, but, more importantly, the transfer of powers on policing  and justice must take place within a reasonable timeframe to ensure that any  new college is part of building a truly new policing and justice dispensation and not just another monument to more  of the old agenda. Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
<p align="left" class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Members who serve on the Policing Board may wish to speak during  the debate. It is important that those Members declare such an interest, as it  is highly relevant to the debate.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, I shall immediately indicate that I have  been a member of the Policing Board since April 2006, lest you take or authorise  any enforcement action against me. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">My party and I strongly support the motion. This debate is  a somewhat bizarre event. The previous contributor, Mr Kelly of Sinn F&eacute;in, has  just said that a police training college is essential. I may have missed the  news overnight or earlier today, but I have not yet heard details of the calling of the ardchomhairle meeting that  will lead to the Ard-Fheis, resulting in Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s signing up to policing.  However, now Sinn F&eacute;in wants a college. Sinn F&eacute;in Members tell us that they  want to train police recruits, yet they refuse to give support to the rule of  law or to the policing institutions. That is an intolerable and unsustainable  position.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">My best advice to Mr Kelly and his party is to stop  lecturing MLAs and the people of Northern Ireland on issues of policing, and to  stop falsely denigrating, and making crude, outrageous and unfounded  allegations against, the honourable members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary,  who stood against anarchy on behalf of the decent people of this country while  the republican movement attempted to wreak havoc. Mr Kelly would be better  served proceeding immediately to ensure that his party does the right thing and  signs up to policing without any further delay.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">I indicated that I am a member of the current Policing  Board. The first Policing Board started work on the college project as far back  as 2002. Very commendably, the independent members and the elected  representatives on the board approached this important matter in a mature  fashion, and have agreed on how the project should proceed. That should be  recognised as a unique feature of the Policing Board&rsquo;s work, and should be  recognised particularly by the Secretary of State and the Government.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Throughout the history of the project, we have heard words  of encouragement but have seen little action from NIO Ministers, some of whom  were mentioned earlier. The commitments that Jane Kennedy gave were mentioned,  and there were various meetings with Shaun Woodward &mdash; if anyone remembers him.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">As a result of the processes that the Policing Board  engaged in, outline planning approval has been granted to the site at  Cookstown. Like the Member for East Londonderry Mr Campbell, I have no doubt  that there are Members who would have preferred locations in their  constituencies to have been chosen &mdash; as I do, he said modestly.<span class="Italic"> [Laughter.]</span></p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  Name them.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  There is plenty of ground around Armagh, and there is a lot of room at  Bessbrook. However, we must accept that the Policing Board, having studied the  matter in some detail, have now purchased and gained planning approval for the  site at Cookstown, which appears to be the most likely candidate for the  college. I have no doubt that other Members, including those who belong to my  party, will advocate alternatives, but we should concentrate on and recognise  the work that the Policing Board has carried out on this matter.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Two outline business cases have been made; the latest gives  a cost of at least &pound;131 million. Once the Government heard those serious sums  of money being bandied about, they started to get cold feet. The Policing Board  has approved the business cases and has entered into long correspondence with  the Govern-ment on them. It has met the current Security Minister, Paul  Goggins, and his immediate predecessor, Shaun Woodward. Representations have  also been made to the Prime Minister, but at this stage the Government are  offering only &pound;90 million, which realistically would only serve to upgrade the  existing police training centre at Garnerville.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">What we want, what Northern Ireland wants and what the  Policing Board wants is a modern, twenty-first century centre of excellence at  the designated site. The Policing Board met the Secretary of State immediately  before the talks at St Andrews. The Secretary of State, keen to see progress,  indicated that there was still a strong commitment to the new training centre,  but he has not yet come up with the extra money. Indeed, in correspondence that  the Policing Board has received, the Northern Ireland Office has confirmed that  no money additional to the &pound;90 million will be made available, and, further to  that, it is not prepared to allow the Policing Board to borrow money to deal  with the shortfall.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">The Government response is very unsatisfactory indeed. It  is the view of the Ulster Unionist Party that Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government alone  should fund a new policing college &mdash; in full. It is not the business of the  Government of a neighbouring jurisdiction to send money or to make donations  towards the building of a centre that is the responsibility of this part of the  United Kingdom. The new college should be state-of-the-art to maximise its  potential as a world-class centre of excellence.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">It is reasonably safe to predict that the Assembly will  agree the motion, and therefore we hope that the Secretary of State will heed  us rather than turn a deaf ear while playing pretend politics and ignoring the  work of the Assembly and its Members. We say to the Secretary of State and to  the Government: it is time to fund the new police college, and the sooner, the  better.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hay</strong>: Like  the Member who moved the motion, I have no problem with the amendment. We would  be fools if we did not want such a project in our areas &mdash; a project that will  probably cost, when finished and operational, about &pound;150 million. .</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">I suppose that I digress a little when I say that I am a  member of the Northern Ireland Policing Board. It is important to declare that  interest.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">This project has been in the minds of members of the  Policing Board from its establishment in November 2001. The new board had many  issues to deal with, but we were all focused on how we might deliver a new  police training college for Northern Ireland and where it might be sited. There  were many discussions on its location.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">As members of the Policing Board, some of us were certainly  batting for our own areas; there is nothing whatsoever wrong with that. Since  2001, this project has been very difficult &mdash; although not from the point of  view of the Policing Board, which has been united and clear about what needs to  be done to deliver this huge project costing over &pound;130 million. It will have huge  economic spin-offs for whichever area is chosen as the location, and for  Northern Ireland as a whole.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">It is rather sad that Sinn F&eacute;in has turned this issue into  a political football, but it does not surprise me. Every political party and  every individual could unite on this motion, if politics could be left aside.  This project will be worth &pound;150 million when it is up and running. I do not  know of any political party, or any individual representative, who would not  want such a project in his or her area. It is sad that Sinn F&eacute;in has decided to  bring politics into this. As with so many issues, Sinn F&eacute;in will agree to a  number of things, but always with preconditions attached. That is the tragedy  of Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s politics across Northern Ireland, especially where policing and  support for law and order are concerned. There should be no preconditions when  it comes to policing and the rule of law in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">The Policing Board has been dealing with this protracted  issue for quite a while. Other Members have mentioned the board&rsquo;s meetings with  the Secretary of State and Government Ministers. There have certainly been plenty of promises, but there has been no  delivery. The Policing Board had a meeting with the Secretary of State  before the St Andrews talks, and the board thought  that he would write us a cheque for the shortfall, but that did not  happen. Even more annoying for the board members was the fact that Government  officials worked alongside the project team in developing the project, so they  were aware of its cost at every turn &mdash; they were not suddenly hit with a bill  for &pound;130 million.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText"><strong>Mr Weir: </strong>Although I am only making an intervention,  I should declare that I am a member of the Policing Board.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Does the Member agree that the Government&rsquo;s obfuscation on  giving the green light to the funding for this police college will work not  only to the detriment of policing in Northern Ireland, but to the detriment of  taxpayers in Northern Ireland? As anyone who has been involved in any  large-scale capital project will know, the longer the project is delayed, the  more the costs go up. Thus, as a new police  college will eventually be needed at some stage, the delay is simply  adding to the final price tag.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hay</strong>: I  certainly agree with the hon Member for North Down. The Policing Board&rsquo;s  greatest fear is that if the project is  delayed for another six months or another year, it will cost us even  more. That is the greatest worry, and that is why the board has been trying to  drive this project on. There is no doubt that there is total unity in the  board&rsquo;s focus and its plans to move the project on. The problem is that the  Government have still not come up with the shortfall.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">In the last few months, the Government have once again  decided to carry out a scoping exercise, which is why other locations in Northern Ireland were considered.  However, a decision has now been made, and I believe that if the shortfall can  be found, work on the project will begin at Cookstown. I have no doubt about  that whatsoever.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">All the other sites that were considered presented several  difficulties. It would be totally negative, for several reasons, for the  project to be moved. For example, it has taken a long time for a second  business plan to be developed. The Government carried out a scoping exercise.  Good work was done by the Policing Board, which tried to move the obstacles  from the door and assist the Government. However, as Danny Kennedy mentioned,  the board does not seem to be able to convince the Government at the highest  level, even by making representations to the Prime Minister. The board has not  been able to move from the door the obstacles to obtaining short-term funding.</p>
<p align="left" class="TimePeriod">2.30 pm</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">In his most recent report, the Oversight Com-missioner made  it clear to the board and to the public that the facilities at Garnerville are  of a Third World standard. I challenge any Member to go to Garnerville and  dispute that its fixtures are of a Third World standard. In order to have an  effective and efficient Police Service, there must be a new police training  college. The House must send out that message. The Government knew all along  what the project would cost; they worked with the Policing Board and its  subcommittee; they worked out the business and economic plans for the project;  and they knew what it would entail several months before the figure, which was then only &pound;90 million, was announced. The  House, and, in particular, those of us who are members of the Policing  Board, cannot accept that.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">The House calls on the Government to put their money where  their mouth is. They clearly indicated that they would provide all the money  that was needed for the new college. The Policing Board should not have to go  along with a begging bowl to any other Government looking for them to part-fund  the college. That is wrong. There have been all sorts of rumours that the  American Administration or the Dublin Administration might fund the college. In  the past few weeks, the Dublin Administration have made clear that the new  college is a British project in Northern Ireland so the British Government  should pay for it. The American Administration have said the same. We must not  fool ourselves. The House must say to the Govern-ment that we shall not seek  funding elsewhere: they must pay for the new college.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The next Member to speak is Mr Raymond McCartney. This is the  first time that Mr McCartney will address the House. It is, therefore, his maiden speech. Members are aware that it is  convention that such a speech be heard without interruption.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Raymond  McCartney</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. As it continues in  its efforts to create a new beginning to policing, Sinn F&eacute;in contends that  proper and supervised training is an indispensable part of changing the culture  and ethos of policing in the North. Indeed, the whole concept of change is  fundamental to any attempt to create a new beginning in policing as outlined  under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. Central to that change is the  need to ensure that all those who want to police us are imbued with the highest  standards of human rights training and are free from political control. No ifs,  buts or maybes. Indeed, it was heartening to hear William Hay say that politics  should be taken out of policing. That has been Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s position for many  years. I could not agree more with what he said.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Any proposed police training college should not be reduced  to a debate about cost, who should pay for it and in whose townland it should  be located. Although &pound;120 million &mdash; some say &pound;150 million &mdash; would buy an awful  lot of bricks and cement, missing from the debate so far, to some extent, is  any commentary about what training ethos  should be promoted in the new building. One wonders how much has been spent on the  building to date, despite not one brick  having been laid.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">As well as that, there is little or no recognition of what  failed in the past or of what permitted Patten to say that the RUC training  college was an abysmal failure by any standard, where the emphasis was more on  military training and where the notion of civic policing was simply that &mdash; a  notion for some distant place, but not here in the North.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">The need for properly structured, delivered and received  training was further highlighted in a recent Human Rights Commission report  that stated that:</p>
<p align="left" class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Human rights and  equality were not accorded a sufficiently central place in the course.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is bad enough, but the following observation  was made about those who were given the responsibility of acting as tutors to  the new recruits.</p>
<p align="left" class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Certain tutors also  made inappropriate remarks on occasion, compounding some of the difficulties  involved in inculcating a culture of human rights in the organisation.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Human Rights Commission found that the content  of the training course materials appeared to understate the nature and depth of  the difficulty faced by the police in gaining the trust of different sections  of society. Material relating to such issues as sectarianism and past abuses of  human rights did not feature, and the authors of the report concluded that:</p>
<p align="left" class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;In ignoring the  historical and current context, the course failed to lay a proper foundation  for the lessons it wished to impart.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Human Rights Commission is also critical that  the training did not meet the requirements laid down by Patten to apprise  officers of the other new institutions such as the Human Rights Consortium, the  Equality Commission and the office of the Police Ombudsman. That finding has  been endorsed by the Oversight Commissioner. In that context, how can one be  surprised that the Police Federation holds the office of the Police Ombudsman  in utter contempt?</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Gerry Kelly envisages a training college where the Irish  national flag can be displayed, and it will be an environment in which the  training will be enshrined in a human rights ethos, and with proper content,  delivery and supervision. It does not need the ardchomhairle to state that; it  has been stated in the House today.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">The British Government should release the funds to build a new policing college, but they should  also deliver the transfer of powers on policing and justice and,  therefore, offset the possibility of yet another damning report on police  training by the Human Rights Com-mission. Let that day come soon. Go raibh  maith agat.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>:  I have no problem in supporting the motion.  I was a police constable from 1975 to 1989, so I know the importance of good training and the need for a  special building for that purpose. It is two years since the Policing Board  announced its approval of the purchase of the 210-acre site at Desertcreat,  close to Cookstown, for the new police college. Two years ago, the Policing  Board took the first step in its agreement with the Independent Commission on  Policing for Northern Ireland, which emphasised the importance of a new  state-of-the-art police college to the long-term success of the training  programme and the transform-ation of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s Police Service.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">The police college is seen as the cornerstone for providing  new recruits, as well as seasoned police and civilian personnel, with an  environment conducive to modern learning and  development techniques. However, the funding for the college, which was  to have been found in the next public  spending round, has fallen short by &pound;40 million. It is imperative that  the Government fund that shortfall now.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">The training facility at Garnerville was originally a  temporary measure, and it was never of an adequate standard, but, unfortunately,  it was the only option for too long. Northern Ireland&rsquo;s police force &mdash; formerly  the RUC, and which is now known as the RUC George Cross &mdash; was renowned  worldwide as a first-class force against the evils of society. Just think about  what a new state-of-the-art academy would do for the PSNI and what  possibilities it would open up for reaching out to police forces worldwide now  and in the future.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">It is a shame that following the progress achieved in  finding a suitable site and the establishment of a public-private partnership  (PPP), sufficient funding is not available from the Government. Is this another  case of the Westminster Government holding off funding from Northern Ireland as  a threat to push the political parties together into political process? The training  and progress of the Police Service of Northern Ireland should not be held to  ransom by the lack of political progress.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">In the Northern Ireland Grand Committee in February 2003,  Jane Kennedy told Lady Hermon that there  was &ldquo;no problem regarding resources&rdquo;. This delay will surely incur  further costs, bumping up the full and real cost of the police college. Despite  assurances from Lord Rooker in the House of Lords that the:</p>
<p align="left" class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;consultancy work and  the commencement of the construction of the college are on hold&rdquo;,</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyTextnoindent">until the final money is found, this setback will  cost the Government more money in the long term.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">It is imperative that the Government at Westminster incur  the complete cost of the police college and find the funding shortfall. The  Police Service of Northern Ireland is being developed and trained to guard and protect all the people of Northern Ireland, and  therefore it is vital that the funding be found within the United  Kingdom. The PSNI cannot afford to divide its loyalty with another country south  of the border, should the Republic of Ireland Government be urged to fund the  college. The Westminster Government must make up the remaining &pound;40 million of  the total cost of &pound;143 million for this college.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">We are at a critical stage &mdash; delays are creating doubts in  the minds of the police, who are in need of a new training facility, and those  businesses, schools and Mid Ulster communities who are looking forward to a state-of-the-art facility being established at  Desertcreat, close to Cookstown. The building of the new college at  Desertcreat will be a tremendous boost for Mid Ulster and has the potential to  inject much-needed finances into the local economy, acting as a catalyst for  other ventures in the future.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">The Desertcreat area is embedded in history. It is close to  Tullyhogue Fort, where the kings of Ulster were crowned, and to Loughry where,  in the 1930s, an agricultural college for ladies was sited, followed by  agricultural colleges for both sexes and, more recently, the College of  Agriculture, Food and Rural Enterprise. This area has always been a place where  new ideas were developed and expanded. Today&rsquo;s Northern Ireland cattle herd  originated from the Desertcreat farm where artificial insemination was first  developed, again in the 1930s, putting Northern Ireland on the world map.<span class="Italic"> [Laughter.]</span></p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText" style="margin-top:4.25pt;">It is no coincidence then that  the Policing Board felt that Desertcreat would provide an excellent site for  the future training and development of the PSNI. We do not need to debate that  Desertcreat is the ideal site for the college; the Policing Board has made that  decision, and it has been confirmed by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in the House of Commons. Cookstown  is centrally positioned within Northern Ireland, only 50 miles from most  places. It is easily accessible on the main A29 road that reaches from  Coleraine to Armagh and is a short distance from both the M1 and M2.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText" style="margin-top:4.25pt;">The Cookstown area is becoming  better known for its entrepreneurial businesses, with many large national  companies setting up there. The people of Cookstown are anxious to see the  cutting of the first sod on the site without delay. It is felt that the new  police academy will bring additional  investment to the area and promote development in the neighbouring towns  and villages.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Madam Speaker &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText" style="margin-top:4.25pt;">I am sorry, Mr Deputy Speaker. I  conclude by saying that the new police college is vital for the future  development of the PSNI; it cannot be delayed any further. That would have  adverse consequences in many areas, including additional costs to the taxpayer,  a continued lack of adequate facilities for the police service and a loss of  confidence in the people of the Cookstown area. The Government must make up the  extra money.</p>
<p align="left" class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName" style="margin-top:4.25pt;"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>: I welcome the honest and frank debate  and the unanimity expressed so far in Assembly in support of a police college  and, in particular, for the specification in the amendment of the Desertcreat  site in Cookstown. However, I will not be lectured on human rights or human  rights training by parties yet to call for the return of exiles, at least for  Christmas.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText" style="margin-top:4.25pt;">The SDLP believes that everyone  is equal before the law and that no one is above the law. We will expose  cover-ups, whoever is responsible &mdash; be it the state in the Finucane case; Sinn F&eacute;in and the IRA in the  McCartney case; or loyalists in the McIlwaine case. We demand that all  democratic political parties accept the rule of law and policing. In the  twenty-first century, police officers and trainees deserve proper facilities. I  hope that the Desertcreat site becomes a twenty-first century facility and a  centre of excellence.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText" style="margin-top:4.25pt;">I am concerned at the  disingenuous nature of the comments of the hon Member Mr Gerry Kelly, who, when  speaking this afternoon, failed to note recent progress on implementing the  Patten Commission&rsquo;s recommendations. Some 87% of the 160 recommend-ations have been either fully or substantially  implemented. In response to Members who commented about other facilities  and opportunities in their constituencies &mdash; and I do not blame them for doing  so &mdash; it was heartening to hear that the Secretary of State, at his meeting with  the Policing Board for Northern Ireland on 10 October, noted that the Ministry  of Defence had offered no sweeteners with any of those sites. Full land value would  have to be paid for any one of them. It is appropriate that the Policing Board  has pursued and obtained the 220 to 230 acre Desertcreat site and that in July  2005 outline planning approval was granted.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Surely provision of the police training college at that  site shows a commitment to the Assembly&rsquo;s decision on decentralisation and the  provision of facilities across the North of Ireland.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">I support the amendment and hope that all Members will get  behind the Policing Board in this debate, and I call upon the Secretary of  State to do likewise. I understand that Minister Goggins is to return to the  Policing Board before the end of December, and I hope that within days he will  make an announcement that will be satisfactory to us all.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  I am delighted to contribute to today&rsquo;s debate, albeit briefly, since I await  in eager anticipation further contributions from the Members opposite, namely  Sinn F&eacute;in, who, if rumours are correct, are preparing to embrace fully policing  and all its structures &mdash; without the Irish tricolour. However, having heard the  contributions of Gerry Kelly and Raymond McCartney, I think that we may be  waiting a long time.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">I support the motion wholeheartedly, not only because it is  been proposed by colleagues and Members representing East Londonderry and North  Antrim respectively, but because two vital components of world-class policing  are education and training and development. They are integral to the provision  of a world-class Police Service. I am confident that these elements will be  greatly enhanced by the college envisaged. However, that dream can only be  realised as a result of a firm, unambiguous and resolute commitment from the  Government that the required additional funding will be forthcoming  immediately. That funding must be made available as a matter of the utmost  priority.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Although I, and most of those whom I represent, dearly wish  to see any future police training college operate on the site of Ballykelly&rsquo;s  historic Shackelton Barracks in my East Londonderry constituency, I will be  content when the funding shortfall is overcome and a long-overdue twenty-first  century training academy is provided for the Province.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">This facility will be in stark contrast to what is  currently available at Garnerville. In response to a question for written  answer tabled by my esteemed colleague Mr Gregory Campbell MP, Mr Paul Goggins  MP said:</p>
<p align="left" class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Ministers have been  exploring all avenues &hellip; to ensure that the project provides value for money.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Security Minister should be informed that the  overriding importance of this project should not, solely, be one of value for  money. Similar importance must be placed on delivering a facility that meets  the needs, and enhances the effectiveness and efficiency, of the police and the  community that they serve.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I support the amendment and the motion.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party expresses its deep disappoint-ment at  the Government&rsquo;s delay in providing the up-to-date, state-of-the-art police college  that they promised. That facility is part of the Patten Report on policing in  Northern Ireland, and a suitable site has been identified in Desertcreat.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">I am pleased that Members are using the name Desertcreat,  which is a townland in County Tyrone. As an ardent supporter of the use of  townland names, I believe that Members should keep that name in the forefront  of our deliberations.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">There was a glimpse on  television yesterday evening of the inadequate and outdated facilities  at Garnerville in east Belfast that have been mentioned on numerous occasions  in the Chamber today. That establishment is long past its sell-by date, and the  Government must be criticised for dragging their heels on the issue of a  replacement. If money can be found for unwanted wars in Iraq and other places,  surely then money can be found to provide a quality police college that turns  out quality policemen and policewomen to serve in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">I welcome the assurance given by Mr Campbell that funding  is available, although I remain sceptical. If the Irish Government wish to make  use of the new training college &mdash; and why not &mdash; I am sure that a financial  contribution will be forthcoming, and it should be welcomed.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">When the new police college is completed, I suggest that it  should be called the &ldquo;Desertcreat Police College for Northern Ireland&rdquo;.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hussey</strong>: I declare that I am a member of my local district policing  partnership, which may be relevant.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">The issue that we are considering is the provision of a  world-class training and education facility for the Police Service. My late, younger, brother did his training in  Enniskillen, County Fermanagh. Currently provision is at Garnerville. My  memories of Garnerville go back to my days at college in Belfast, when it was  not a police training college. Members may recall the previous use of  Garnerville. I support the motion in the context of what it is designed to  achieve &mdash; what we all, I suspect, wish it to achieve &mdash; namely, world-class  training and education.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Mr McGlone referred to the idea of the development of a  joint blue-light college, and I support that. However, I do not fully support  the amendment, and I am sure that the proposer of the amendment will understand  that. I will come back to that point. In regard to the pedigree of the site  mentioned in the amendment, I will address that issue in time.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Like other Members, I urge the Chancellor of the Exchequer,  Mr Brown &mdash; who I understand may be seeking another job &mdash; to meet the financial  requirements needed to start this project immediately. The Treasury holds the  purse strings. Members have already said that the longer that this project is  delayed, the larger the shortfall will be. It is imperative that the project be  started as soon as possible. Funding could be made available after Christmas,  as everything is more or less ready for work to begin on site, and that is what  we should aim for.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">I found it interesting that Mr Raymond McCartney, in his  maiden speech, supported Mr Hay&rsquo;s suggestion of taking policing out of  politics. Why, if he wants to take policing out of politics, does he put so  much emphasis on having policing devolved to politicians in Northern Ireland? I  fail to follow his logic.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">I now move on to fiscal pragmatism. If the funding is not  forthcoming, Members must consider the alternatives. I proudly declare a  further interest as a representative for West Tyrone. I trust that the party  sitting at the top right-hand side of the Chamber will appreciate that I  support the economic desires of its party colleague and MP for West Tyrone. I  trust that that party and its MP appreciate that. We look towards joined-up  government.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Planners tell us that we should utilise brownfield sites.  The proposal is for a greenfield site. We have a site at Lisanelly &mdash; and I  refer to the townland name. That site, combined with the Army base at St Lucia,  would be equal in size to the site currently available; it has the  substructure, the surface infrastructure and the necessary security perimeter.  It also has world-class third-level educational provision in the brand new  college in Omagh adjacent to it. In such circumstances, &pound;90 million would  possibly enable a college to take recruits and personnel before the end of the  next calendar year. If that is a fiscal requirement, and if that is being  pragmatic, then I am not ashamed of that. However, I urge the Government to  fund the project as it stands; if they do not, I urge the Policing Board to  consider the motion and to put in place the mechanism that will provide that  college as soon as possible.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  I declare that I am a member of the Policing Board and am very honoured and  privileged to serve on it.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Members have heard about training for the RUC &mdash; now the  PSNI, incorporating the RUC GC. However, we fail to hear about the cowardly  campaign of terrorism against RUC personnel over the past 35 years. Police  officers returning from work at night were shot in the back of the head, and  officers were blown up by an under-car bobby trap on their way to work in the  morning. Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s memory is very selective; it is a bit like its attention  to the rule of law.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">I pay tribute to the officers of the RUC, and their  families, who made the ultimate sacrifice for the entire community.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">I turn to the issue of the policing college. My colleagues  have already said that it is an abdication of responsibility on the part of our  Government to make available only &pound;90 million for building the college, and to  fail to provide the extra &pound;40 million that is required. We may as well not get  any money at all if the Govern-ment are not prepared to provide the required  amount.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">There is no doubt that Garnerville is a college from the  dark ages and, as my hon Friends have said, it has facilities that one would  expect to see in the Third World. Yesterday, I listened to Deputy Chief Constable  Paul Leighton on the radio, describing the rooms in which student officers  sleep and share their bathroom facilities. I wondered why training was ever  moved from the depot in Enniskillen. However, that was probably due to the threat of terrorism at that time from colleagues of those who sit opposite me in the  Chamber.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">If the Government are sincere about policing and justice as  a central issue in Northern Ireland, they must divvy up the money for the new  policing college. We cannot have a twenty-first century police service with  nineteenth-century facilities. The Government deliver good rhetoric on  policing, but when it comes to delivering resources, it is quite a different  matter.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">I have brought a copy of today&rsquo;s &lsquo;Daily Telegraph&rsquo; to let  the House see its headlines, which state that 900 police stations have shut up  shop. That number relates to police stations in England and Wales over the last  14 years, where the vast majority of those that remain open are operating only  during limited hours. Since the Patten Report, we in Northern Ireland,  including my constituents, have seen the  closure of a number of police stations. We are told that those closures  are not about cutting resources, but about  using them more effectively. My colleague William Hay, the Member for  Foyle, is the chairman of the finance committee of the Northern Ireland  Policing Board, and he tells me that policing is always faced with financial  constraints. Therefore, if it is not about cutting resources, what is it about?</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">According to today&rsquo;s radio reports, there were five  robberies of elderly people last night in one area. Phone-in radio shows  demonstrate that the public are not satisfied with the level of resources that  are put into policing in Northern Ireland. That is true whether it relates to manpower, human resources on the  ground, or the new policing college. The message from this House to the  Government is that they cannot police Northern  Ireland or any other part of the United Kingdom on the cheap. They  should make the money available for the new college immediately. I support the  motion.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McFarland</strong>:  I had the experience &mdash; or perhaps the good fortune &mdash; to have served on the  first Policing Board, but I am no longer a member after standing down in April.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Like our experience during the first Assembly mandate, the  first Policing Board adopted a DIY approach in that it sought out the best  policing practice from around the world. Since 2001, the PSNI has developed  world-class expertise, particularly in community policing. The PSNI is a world  model for human rights policing, with its code of ethics for each officer and  its rigorous annual human rights inspection by two of the UK&rsquo;s foremost human  rights lawyers, Keir Starmer and Jane Gordon. If Members have not read those  reports, they should do so.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">The expertise of our community police service is coupled  with the background of the RUC as the best anti-terrorist police service in the  world. Former RUC officers are currently stationed across the world in places  such as Iraq, for example, training people in state-of-the-art anti-terrorist  techniques.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Thus, the PSNI is well placed to deliver world-class training for both its own recruits and those from  overseas. It is in that context that the idea for the police college has  been developed. I was involved in discussions with the NIO, and there were  assurances that the full cost of the college would be covered. Indeed, we said  that the Policing Board would probably not proceed with the project unless that  undertaking was given.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">What has gone wrong? Why are the Government procrastinating  now? We have had agitation from some in Londonderry to halt the project and to  resite it there. There have been voices off trying to steer the college to  assorted former Army bases around the Province, and some have been demanding  joint training with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the new site &mdash; hence the Irish  Government trying to offer money. I am not too sure that the Garda trainers at Templemore are too impressed with that  idea.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">My guess is that the  delays represent the Government putting pressure on the PSNI and the  Policing Board to cut back on its enormous &pound;720 million budget. Could it be  that the NIO has its eye on clawing back the 3,000 additional police officers  that Patten proposed for Northern Ireland in order to move us out of conflict?  Watch this space.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Madam Speaker in the Chair)</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Each month&rsquo;s delay increases the cost of the original  ambitious concept &mdash; a world-class college, offering training that only the  PSNI, with its expertise in both community and anti-terrorist policing, can  provide. If that is to be met, then the NIO must crack on and meet the  obligations that it accepted in 2002.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I support the motion. There was a great cheer on the day that planning  permission was sought. That was a major hurdle on the way to building a new  police college. The funding seemed secure, as the college was recommendation  131 of the so-called Patten Report, which, as we all know, the Government have been keen to implement in full. As usual,  however, once the Government&rsquo;s agenda had been fulfilled &mdash; namely, getting rid of the Royal Ulster  Constabulary &mdash; the rest of the  recommendations were pushed to the side.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">It was recommended that the PSNI be provided with an infrastructure for development and training  excellence, so the search began to find the facilities that could  provide a state-of-the-art training college that would draw worldwide renown  and hopefully attract much-needed positive attention to Northern Ireland and  its policing policy. A site was found, a blueprint drawn up, and a community  buoyed by the promise of a boost to their local economy. Yet here we stand,  attempting to get the Government to live up to their promises on at least this  one area.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">There is no doubt that we are in great need of a facility  that not only deals with the day-to-day service to the community that the  Province needs, but also has the capacity to train for the ever more possible  threat of chemical or biological warfare. The 210-acre space provides room for  a train carriage, plane fuselage and on-site bank to simulate hijackings and  robberies, as well as purpose-built accommodation with 300 rooms, and a village  built for public order training along with decontamination units. The estimate  of &pound;80 million was a modest sum, especially when taking into account the sheer  class of what is being timetabled.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">To accept any less would be unthinkable when one looks at  the amount of money that the Government have poured into futile exercises such  as the Bloody Sunday Inquiry. Here is something that would not only benefit  police training and consequently the safety of the 440 policemen and policewomen recruited annually and the  communities that they serve, but also has the potential  to benefit other police services on the mainland.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">When seeking to build a twenty-first century facility for a  twenty-first century police service, one must pay twenty-first century prices.  It is possible that other services such as the Fire and Rescue Service and the  Army bomb squad could use the facilities, which would go some measure towards  offsetting the cost factor. The simple fact is that Garnerville does not come  up to scratch and needs replaced. The old adage that if something is worth  doing, it is worth doing right, fits this situation perfectly. Hugh Orde has  said that the current facilities are limited, with no specialist information  technology provision. Interview and courtroom training facilities are poor, and  the physical training suites are grossly inadequate.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">There must be a drastic overhaul. Given the circumstances,  there is no point in Members pushing for anything less than excellence. To do  so would be a disservice to the future of Northern Ireland and to the PSNI in  particular.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">The Preparation for  Government Committee&rsquo;s findings on the economy made it abundantly clear  that in a new period of stability, Northern  Ireland has a huge potential to thrive, if given the opportunity to do  so. Investment is needed, and it is slightly surreal that the Government are  quibbling over the relatively small sum of money that is required for the  police college. If funding were to be sought for such frivolous nonsense as the  Millennium Dome, the required money, and more, would be granted in the blink of  an eye. Yet it is not granted for a police college with the capacity to rejuvenate not only the town in which it is built,  but also the entire Police Service. Northern Ireland&rsquo;s status as a twenty-first century country is being shunted to  the side.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">The building of the  police college must begin as soon as is practicable. There has been some  talk of going ahead and getting a loan for the outstanding sum of &pound;40 million,  and I support the drive and determination of those who desire to see the full  potential realised as soon as possible. If it is necessary to take out a loan,  it must be done.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Undoubtedly, it is entirely up to the Government to find  the funding needed for the police college. It is probable that the Government  are merely chancing their arm by attempting to withhold what should be given  freely. They do so in the hope that Members will throw up their heads, become frustrated at all the delays and,  anxious to move ahead, find another source of funding. After all their wavering  and fickleness, the Government must move forward and provide the necessary  funding immediately. Without further delay or postulating, the Government must  fulfil their obligation to provide the best possible service to the people of  the Province by building a purpose-made facility that will be an example to  other services and a means to a safer, secure and stable Northern Ireland.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText"><strong>Mr Attwood: </strong>I acknowledge everyone who has contributed to a new beginning for policing,  particularly the Police Ombudsman, the members of the DPPs and the  Policing Board. The biggest single achievement of the Good Friday Agreement is  that much of the best work done over the last number of years, and many of the  best opportunities for our society created in that time, can be sourced in the  work of all those who signed up to a new beginning for policing five or six  years ago. That is why the British Government should now respond quickly and positively  to the leadership of both the Policing Board and the PSNI by funding the new  police college.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">I listened intently to the debate, and I look forward to  hearing what Ian Paisley Jnr has to say. However, during the course of the  debate, quite a number of the speeches made from the unionist Benches moved  closer to the amendment tabled by Patsy McGlone. I urge the unionist parties to  support the SDLP&rsquo;s amendment. My primary reason for doing so is that Gregory  Campbell quoted what Jane Kennedy said about a new police college when she was  Security Minister, some time ago. He quoted her as having said that &ldquo;resources  are not the issue&rdquo; and that she hoped that things would progress &ldquo;very  rapidly&rdquo;. At that time, her comments were unambiguous.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Yet now, significantly later, there is still ambiguity  about funding for the new police college.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText"><strong>Mr Poots: </strong>I have a point of order, Madam Speaker. I  have allowed Mr Attwood some time to declare an interest, but I note that he  has not yet done so. As he is a member of the Policing Board, it is appropriate  for him to do that now.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I thank the Member for that prompt, and I so declare.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText" style="text-indent:14.2pt;">Since Jane Kennedy&rsquo;s comments,  there has been ambiguity, delay and doubt about the funding of the policing  college. There are elements in the British Government who, for whatever reason,  want to cause further delays and create greater doubt about that funding. If  the Assembly does not unanimously, or at least substantially, endorse the  amendment tabled by Patsy McGlone, those elements will feel somewhat reassured.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Given that there are some indications that the Security  Minister, Paul Goggins, may be minded to make a decision about funding of this  matter in the very near future and that he appears to be a man of good intentions, I urge all parties, even at this  late hour, to accept the amendment. That is how the political leadership  in the North can send out a message of certainty in the midst of the delay and  doubt that have characterised the British Government&rsquo;s response over the last  three or four years.</p>
<p align="left" class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">A number of Members have commented on the prospect of the  Dublin Government making a con-tribution to the police college. The SDLP  negotiated a provision in the St Andrews Agreement for North/South funds, over and above any of the other  institutions of the Good Friday Agreement that are now in place or that  may develop in the future. I have heard nobody, in this Chamber or outside, say at any time that he opposes the  Irish Government&rsquo;s making a contribution to the North through North/South  funds. I have heard nobody declare that he does not want a new road built in  some border area because it is to be part-funded by the Irish Government. No  strategic, political or other reason has been offered to explain how the SDLP  proposal with respect to North/South funds poses any political threat to any  interest in the North.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">The SDLP says that it is quite proper to extend that  argument to a moderate contribution from the Irish Government towards the  police college. We do not do that just for some narrow political reason, though  some would portray it as such. We do it because of the Patten Report and  because the relationship between the garda&iacute; and the PSNI is such that having a  facility in the North part-funded by the Irish Government and which the Irish  Government and the garda&iacute; &mdash; and, perhaps, other emergency services in the South  &mdash; can use makes sense.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Jim Shannon made a very interesting point. He rightly  identified many substantial reasons for needing a police college in  Desertcreat, including the threat of international terror and chemical attack,  with a con-sequent need for decontamination chambers and the like. The Patten  Report said that there is a need for joint disaster planning and training. Any  chemical attack in this part of the world will affect the people of this island  equally. Why not have the Irish Government contribute a moderate sum to the  police college in the North in order that they, through the garda&iacute;, and our-selves, through the PSNI, can have joint training  exercises in case that sort of disaster is inflicted on our people?</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">It makes sense in policing, practical, operational and  community terms, and we should do it. For that reason, among others, we are not  saying that we should go to Dublin with a begging bowl. If Dublin thought that  it was giving money to the North, for any reason, to go in a begging bowl, it  would quickly and rightly show us the door. There are strong imperatives for  North/South funding of various dimensions being extended to the police college.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">I listened intently to the Sinn F&eacute;in speeches. In one way  they demonstrated a misunderstanding, and in another way they were downright  muddled. Gerry Kelly said that Sinn F&eacute;in wanted a new training college and that  it should fly the Irish tricolour. He implied that the tricolour should fly  equally with the Union flag. What Sinn F&eacute;in fails to recognise is that the only  flag that currently flies over any police building is that of the PSNI, and  that only at police headquarters. How can he argue that the Irish national flag  should fly over police stations and the new police college when the Union flag  has not flown over any police building for the last five or six years?</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in twice referred in a disparaging way to  high-profile police developments being in somebody&rsquo;s backyard and said that the  issue of the police college should not be reduced to whose townland it ends up  in.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">I beg to differ. One of the reasons that the Policing Board  was attracted by the application for the college to be built at the Desertcreat  site near Cookstown was, in my view, because it was a substantial investment in  the west of this part of Ireland &mdash; a place that has historically and  structurally suffered disadvantage and discrimination.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">If I had the choice between a police college at the Maze site or one in the west or the north, on the  grounds of discrimination and disadvantage, I know which location I  would choose. Jim Shannon had the good sense to make that point, unlike the  Sinn F&eacute;in repre-sentatives, who had the bad  sense to oppose that approach.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">The third reason that Sinn F&eacute;in was muddled and confused is  that it quite rightly referred to a series of human rights commentaries about  the police training college and its human rights provisions. However, those  representatives failed to mention all the follow-up reports that were  commissioned by the Policing Board and others in order to correct the deficiencies  in human rights training to the point that, if they would only read the last  report of the Policing Board&rsquo;s human rights advisers, Keir Starmer and Jane  Gordon, they would see how far human rights culture and training have  progressed. That work is not finished. However, the Patten Report said that the  job of implementing the Patten reforms should fall to the Policing Board, and  not through grandstanding outside the Policing Board, as Sinn F&eacute;in has done  over the past number of years.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">We need a police  college in the North to demonstrate modern and progressive policing, to  embed the Patten reforms and policing change and to drive forward the policing  agenda. However, there is another reason. The SDLP is of the view that a police  college should become an international centre of excellence, where other  societies that are emerging from conflict can come to this part of Ireland and  be trained in best policing practice and policy. Over and above the domestic  and national needs for a police college in Cookstown, there is, ironically, an  international need, whereby Cookstown police college could become a symbol of  best policing practice across the world.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>: At the outset of my speech, I declare that I am a member of the  Northern Ireland Policing Board.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">This debate is not about where a police college should be  built, despite Members&rsquo; obvious and clear entitlement to indicate where they  would like the college to be built. The debate is about something else  altogether &mdash; delivery. It is about the delivery of the necessary resource to  build the police college and the delivery of the will to see the police college  built.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">We have cleared a hurdle in relation to where the college  should be built, because the Policing Board, and all the political parties  represented on it, has unanimously endorsed where the college should be. That is why the DUP has no problem with the  proposed amendment to the motion.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">As with so many things in Northern Ireland, we discuss the  issue of delivery. Delivery by Sinn F&eacute;in on the rule of law is an issue in this  debate, just as that party&rsquo;s failure to deliver is an issue. It was made an  issue by the contributions of Sinn F&eacute;in Members. There will be no confidence  that there will be delivery on a justice and policing Minister within a certain  given timescale until Sinn F&eacute;in signs up to  and supports the rule of law, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, and the rule of law demonstrated by our courts &mdash;  in total.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">During his contribution, Mr Kelly begrudgingly made several  comments about the police college; he said that the issue is not about the  building but about what goes on inside the building. However, it was clear from  Mr Kelly&rsquo;s comments that he does not have a clue about what goes on in that  building and that he has not had a clue for some time. Mr Kelly now wants a  police college, but he wants it without his supporting the PSNI and the rule of  law. I say to him loudly and clearly that he must totally support the police  service, he must totally support the rule of law and he must totally support  the royal courts of justice. Then he will see a college working appropriately  and properly.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">He had the audacity to say, &ldquo;Bring it on&rdquo;. One of the  things that he wants is an end to training in the use of baton rounds.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Well, if they stopped rioting in north Belfast there would  be no more need to have training in baton rounds. Bring it on: stop the rioting  in north Belfast.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Mr Kelly said he wanted to see the Irish national flag flying over the police training college. Mr  Attwood has quite rightly pointed out that if Mr Kelly wants the Irish  national flag, he will also want the Union Jack. So, this afternoon Sinn F&eacute;in  is calling for the Union Jack to fly over police establishments in Northern Ireland. What a change we have seen in Sinn F&eacute;in  today.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Of course, Mr Kelly does not want to see training in the use of water cannons. I know that from time  to time he has had an annual wash down by water cannons. Again, if they  stopped the rioting in certain parts of Ulster, water cannons would no longer  be used.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  Mr Paisley, I remind you that we do not want personal comments.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  Absolutely.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in should go and live in the real world.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I am sure that the Member would wish to include in his call for an end to  rioting the rioting around parades and at Whiterock. While I am on my feet, let  it be noted that I am also a member of the Northern Ireland Policing Board.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  In his contribution, Mr Kelly made some awful characterisations and slurs about  the Police Service of Northern Ireland, and the Royal Ulster Constabulary,  which preceded it. He indicated that it was a partisan police service that  derived from the Ulster Volunteer Force. That is a slur, and it does nothing to  demonstrate that Sinn F&eacute;in has crossed the Rubicon in its little narrow mind  that it must cross if we are going to see support for the police and the rule  of law. Sinn F&eacute;in is giving no indication that it wants to change.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">While we are talking about organisations, let us talk about  the great &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann &mdash;what has it morphed from? It has morphed from  the psychopathic headbangers of Patrick Pearse into the drug-dealing,  granny-beating, child-killers of Northern Ireland.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  Mr Paisley &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Order. Mr Paisley, please keep to the motion. I am sure you  are articulate enough to do that.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  Thank you for that prompting, Madam Speaker.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">We also heard a masterful contribution on policing from  another Member of Sinn F&eacute;in &mdash; the one-time hunger striker who did not make it.  Of course, his brother runs Community Restorative Justice Ireland (CRJI). If we  look at the model advocated by that particular organisation &mdash;</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Raymond  McCartney</strong>: On a point of order. That is not true. He does not run CRJI. The  Member is wrong and he should withdraw his comment.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  Thank you. I remind Members that they should be careful in how they talk about  people who are not Members of the House. Mr Paisley, will you withdraw that  remark?</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  Madam Speaker, I am going to defend the remark on this basis &mdash; it must have  been his twin brother, or someone remarkably like him, who advocated community  restorative justice to the Northern Ireland Policing Board.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Raymond  McCartney</strong>: There is a difference between advocating community restorative  justice and the statement made by the Member. He made a very clear statement  that the person concerned was running CRJI, and he is wrong.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  I agree with you, Mr McCartney.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hussey</strong>:  On a point of order.<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span></p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  Order. Mr Paisley, would you repeat the comment that you made about Mr Raymond  McCartney&rsquo;s brother?</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  He helps to run the CRJI, and he is a member of that organisation. Madam  Speaker, if it would help to clarify the situation, I will say that he helps to  run it. Let us deal with the issue. Mr McCartney said &mdash;<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span></p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  Order. Do people not listen to what I say at every session? We must have order  in the House. Can I also &mdash;</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hussey</strong>:  On a point of order.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  Just a moment, Mr Hussey, I am on my feet.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">I heard what you said, Mr Paisley. I took it that you felt  that Mr McCartney&rsquo;s brother had helped to run CRJI. If that is not correct, I  would ask you to withdraw the remark.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Raymond  McCartney</strong>: He said very clearly &mdash;</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  That is fine, Mr McCartney. Sit down. I will examine the Hansard report and I  will come back to the issue.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Raymond  McCartney</strong>: Please do.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  Thank you very much.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  Madam Speaker, I am happy for you to examine Hansard.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  Mr Hussey has a point of order.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hussey</strong>: I  would like to raise a point of order under Standing Order 2(a). Madam Speaker,  you said that if any Member rose to make a point of order, they were to name  the relevant Standing Order. That constantly does not happen in the House.  Thank you.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  I certainly agree with your comments, Mr Hussey. That does not stop Members,  and that is why I asked whether people ever listened to what I say.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  On a point of order, Madam Speaker. Can we take it that, under Standing Order  2(a), we can treat Mr Paisley Jnr&rsquo;s earlier comments &mdash; in fact, his entire  contribution &mdash; as having the same integrity as they had when he talked about  community restorative justice?</p>
<p align="left" class="TimePeriod">3.30pm</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  As I am sure that Mr Hussey would point out, that is not a point of order. I  assure Members &mdash; including Mr Paisley Jnr, who I know will agree &mdash; that I will  look at Hansard and will come back to it.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  Some Members are obviously reluctant to hear about community restorative  justice. Why is that? Is it because community restorative justice groups&rsquo;  exercising of policing and the type of policing that they want exiles people  from Belfast? Do they want people to withhold information from the police and  the courts? Or is it because the head of training of one of those groups was  convicted for the murders of Corporal Wood and Corporal Howes in Belfast? Is  that the sort of police training that they want in Northern Ireland?</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  Mr Paisley, I ask once again whether that has anything to do with the police  college. It does not, as far as I am concerned.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  It does absolutely; my point is about training.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Mr Raymond McCartney indicated that he wants a new ethos in  policing. If that ethos is the same as that of the Community Restorative  Justice Ireland Network, that is not the ethos that people in Northern Ireland  need, nor is it the ethos that the Protestant community wants. Indeed, I bet my  bottom dollar that it is not the ethos that Roman Catholics want for their  country either.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Raymond  McCartney</strong>: Will the Member give way?</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  In case you did not notice, Mr Paisley Jnr, a Member asked whether you would  give way. However, it is up to you whether you do.</p>
<p align="left" class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  I am well aware of the Members who wish me to give way, but I will not do so.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">The ethos of the police should be &mdash; and is &mdash; that they  support democracy, that they support wholeheartedly the rule of law, that thou  shalt not kill and that thou shall respect diversity. That ethos exists in the  police training college, and has existed there for some time. However, the  ethos of republicans has been to bomb, kill and murder police recruits.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">In my constituency, I once saw republicans plant a pipe  bomb underneath the car of a Roman Catholic man who had been recruited to the  Police Service. That bomb had been planted by republicans, and that action was  not condemned by the Provisional IRA or its spokespeople.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Quite rightly, many Members have taken the opportunity  through the debate to say where they want a new police college to be built.  However, in its past and current forms, the Policing Board has been selfless in  ensuring that it gets the best site for Northern Ireland. Acquiring such a site  should result in the building of a new police college. However, it is ironic  that the failure to implement a proposal that has unanimous political support  is being blocked by the Northern Ireland Office, by the Treasury and by the  Government. It is perverse that the NIO is stumbling on and delaying the issue.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">I ask Members to consider the contribution that our police  officers make to police training across the world. Former RUC officers manage  police training in Kosovo, and a former assistant chief constable manages similar  training in Basra, yet Northern Ireland still lacks the state-of-the-art,  world-class training centre that it deserves.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">Some Members called for the location of the college to be  changed. If the location is changed, costs will either increase or decrease.  However, that is not the issue. The issue is whether we can build a college  that has the unique selling point of a tactical training village such as that  mentioned in the current police college business strategy.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyText">The current facilities in the police college at Garnerville  are Third World. We recognise that a new college must be built; we will not  settle for second best. It is therefore up to the British Government to give  the money now to ensure that we have the first-class college that Ulster  deserves for its police recruits.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question, <span style="font-style:normal; ">That the  amendment be made, </span>put and agreed to.</p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyTextItalic">Main Question, as amended, put and agreed to.<span style="font-style:normal; "> </span></p>
<p align="left" class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
<p align="left" class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls  upon the Government to provide the necessary funding to allow a new police  college to be built in Cookstown, Desertcreat site.</p>
