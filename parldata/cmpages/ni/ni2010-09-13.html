<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:I  also advise the House that I have received notification from the nominating  officer of the Democratic Unionist Party, the Rt Hon Peter Robinson, that he  has nominated Mr Jonathan Craig as Chairperson of the Audit Committee. Mr Craig  has accepted the appointment. If all of that is clear, let us move to today&rsquo;s  business.</p>
<p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="a5" id="a5"></a>Ministerial Statements</p>
<p class="H4StageHeading">Northern    Ireland Water</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice from the Minister for Regional Development that he  wishes to make a statement. Before I call the Minister, I remind the House that  there will be a number of statements from Ministers today. Let us be clear that  questions must refer directly to the statement; we cannot have questions that  have nothing to do with the statement. Members might intend to make statements  and then try to ask a question. Again, further statements are not needed; there  are enough today. Let us have questions on the statement. Of course,  Chairpersons of Committees will have some latitude before developing their  questions. If that is clear, we shall proceed.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development (Mr Murphy)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.  I welcome the opportunity to update the Assembly on recent events relating to  NI Water. I previously addressed the Assembly on the matter on 15 March 2010.  At that time, I explained my decision to remove the chairman and a number of  non-executive directors from the board of NI Water because of procurement  governance failures. I welcome the general support for the actions that I took.  Since then, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) has been holding hearings on  the matter. I welcome that, and I look forward to the outcome of its  deliberations. There has also been intense media speculation about the events  that led to my decision.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The procurement governance failures in NI Water are serious  matters that involved more than 70 contracts worth &pound;28&middot;4 million of public  money. As Minister, I am charged with protecting the public interest, and, on  the evidence presented to me, I am satisfied that I took the right course of  action. A number of issues are being followed up through appropriate channels.  The governance failures at NI Water and matters relating to the report of the  independent review team will now be subject to robust scrutiny from the PAC. Separately, events following the PAC hearing on NI  Water, which led to the suspension of Paul Priestly, are the subject of an  inquiry. I consider those investigations to be the right and proper course of  action.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The position of NI Water staff has been dealt with through  the company&rsquo;s disciplinary procedures. The disciplinary process has taken  longer than expected. However, I am advised that matters are being progressed  by the chief executive as expeditiously as possible, bearing in mind that due  process must be followed. I will make public any further action that may be  taken in that regard. I will refer to the appointments to the board of NI Water  later.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I turn to the wider implications for the governance of  water and sewerage services. We need to remind ourselves how essential and  basic those services are. The water that we drink and the disposal of our waste  water affect fundamentally our health, environment and economic development.  When I took office in May 2007, that area was already mired in controversy,  principally connected to the direct rule plans to impose water charges but also  because we needed to meet EU environmental standards and improve an  infrastructure that had suffered from underinvestment in the past.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">My main aim has been to ensure that the investment issues  are addressed, which has been done by pumping &pound;750 million into the  infrastructure over the past three years. To its credit, NI Water now delivers  the best drinkingwater quality that the North has ever enjoyed. Waste water  treatment standards are the highest ever, although there is more to be done,  and leakage has reduced. We have achieved that without introducing domestic  charges for water.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I will continue to fight for the investment that we need  and to acknowledge what NI Water has achieved, but we have seen a catalogue of  events and governance failures that has made improving those essential services  more difficult. The structure that I inherited, a Go-co model that was set up  through direct rule legislation, is at odds with the public sector provision of  water and sewerage services that most people support. That legacy has not best  served the public interest here.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We have moved forward on the investment priorities, but we  now need to address the difficult governance issues in the short and longer  term. Long-term solutions will take longer, and they will involve extensive  legislation to establish new governance arrangements. That process will extend  beyond the lifetime of this Assembly. It includes, for instance, the  commitments that we have given to public consultation and the need to take into  account the conclusions of the Public Accounts Committee.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I will bring proposals to the Executive. The governance  arrangements should be based on water and sewerage services being delivered by  a body that is clearly within the public service, subject to public service  controls and standards and not set up to introduce separate water charges for  households or be privatised. That is my long-term aim. In the meantime, I must  deal with the realities of what it is possible to do in the short term.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Immediately following the publication of the report on  procurement failings, I agreed a joint DRD/NI Water action plan, which has  delivered the following actions to date: adepartmental representative now  attends all NI Water audit committee meetings;NI Water has prepared a new  procurement manual and circulated it throughout the organisation; andprocurement  compliance is now a standing item at NI Water board meetings. The Department  has also introduced a revised reporting format at all quarterly shareholder  meetings which provides more comprehensive assurances on adherence to  delegations and other governance requirements. A comprehensive training  programme which deals with all aspects of procurement and financial delegations  was developed and has been delivered to all senior staff in NI Water. An  external review of the adequacy and competence of the NI Water internal audit  function has been completed, and a report is due to be finalised very soon. A  new procurement compliance officer was appointed on 20 August.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Making wide-ranging changes to structures will extend  beyond the present Assembly term. I also need to allow for the conclusions of  the Public Accounts Committee&rsquo;s inquiry. Going forward, I will work within  existing structures and with stakeholders to ensure that the most appropriate  controls and accountability are in place. Those controls need to reflect the  reality of continued majority public funding of water and sewerage services. I  am clear that arrangements need to reflect public sector disciplines and  standards.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I recognise that there are tensions between the company&rsquo;s  freedom and flexibility to deliver services to customers and regulatory  requirements and public expenditure rules. However, that should not compromise  accountability for use of public resources, including reporting to the  Assembly. Where there is a lack of clarity or unavoidable tension, public  sector requirements should take precedence. If necessary, I will bring forward  proposals for legislation to clarify that position. In particular, I will  consider whether I should have a power to direct the company to adopt policies and  procedures that reflect public sector disciplines. The company is also  subjected to regulatory controls, and I will consider whether I should have a  power to direct the regulator to investigate or take action under those  controls if the need arises. While the majority of funding continues to come  from government, I will also consider whether I need to have the power to  direct changes to the company&rsquo;s terms of appointment, which are commonly  referred to as the licence. The proposals will support my aim of ensuring that  public accountability is the key consideration, regardless of the mix of  regulation, company law or public expenditure structures that we inherited.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I made it clear in March, when I announced my decision to  remove four of the five existing non-executive directors from the NI Water  board, that the Department will take action to appoint a number of new  non-executive directors to the board on an interim basis. Given the urgency and  the need to bring some stability to the organisation, the Department secured  the agreement of the Commissioner for Public Appointments to run an emergency  process as a deviation from the Commissioner for Public Appointments&rsquo; code,  subject to a demonstrable level of independent participation and conditional on  the appointments being short-term in nature. That was done, and, as Members  will be aware, an interim chairperson and four interim non-executive directors  were appointed to the NI Water board recently.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I would like to express publicly my appreciation to each of  those individuals for offering their services at relatively short notice. It is  important to emphasise that those are interim appointments pending the running  of a full appointments process, which I intend to commence as soon as possible.  The full appointments process will take between six and nine months and will be  carried out in an open, transparent and independent manner in accordance with  the Commissioner for Public Appointments&rsquo; NI code.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Of course, no governance arrangements can rule out all  risks. However, I believe that these measures, together with the work of the  Public Accounts Committee, will resolve the situation in the interim until  longer-term solutions can be implemented.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Regional Development (Mr Cobain)</strong>: The Minister&rsquo;s  statement touched on many far-reaching issues. The statement has significant  implications for Northern Ireland Water, the Executive and the Budget, not  least what he is really describing: the renationalisation of Northern Ireland  Water.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I do not think that anyone would disagree that Northern  Ireland Water has had a difficult history. Significant governance issues have  to be addressed, and confidence in Northern Ireland Water has to be restored.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">However, the question of Northern Ireland Water&rsquo;s future  has been with the Executive since the publication of the independent water  review team&rsquo;s report in early 2007. What do the Executive propose to do to  resolve the issues that the Minister identified as tensions in his statement?  Is this a matter for the Executive, or is it a matter for him and his  Department?</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Significant amounts of money have been spent transforming  the Water Service into Northern Ireland Water as a Go-co. Will more money be  spent in achieving the new governance arrangements that the Minister talks  about? What guarantees do we have that it will not be a case of throwing good  money after bad?</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Finally, the Minister mentioned the need for legislation to  provide clarity. Does he propose to bring forward legislation in this mandate?  If so, when and how does he propose to engage with the Regional Development  Committee?</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I thank the Chairperson of the Committee for his  statement. He is quite correct in identifying significant implications for the  future of NI Water, and he shares my view that it has a troubled history. It is  appropriate that we look to correct the serious failures of governance. In the  longer term, there are financial implications for the Executive in changing the  status of NIW, because HMRC could increase NIW&rsquo;s costs by between &pound;45 million  and &pound;55 million per annum. That would depend on the precise status of the water  and sewerage undertaker, and it would have to be considered in longer-term  proposals. Therefore, there would be implications in respect of tax, VAT and  other issues for the Executive, and, naturally, the Executive would want to  consider that. The Chairperson asked whether there would be a further cost in  that, and it is my intention over the coming period to develop ideas and bring  them to the Executive.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Obviously there is a limited time frame for longer-term  legislation. There are 300 articles and 13 sections in the legislation that set  up NIW, so it would be impossible to change that between now and the end of  this mandate. However, there are short-term measures. I want to ensure that  where there is a potential conflict between what company law requires and the  public sector interest in all of this &mdash; it is the public sector interest that  has suffered as a consequence of what we discovered was going on at NIW &mdash;  public sector interest overrules that. If it is necessary to make some  short-term amendments to ensure that that is the case in the interim, I will do  that. I will engage with the Chairperson and the Committee as I go along on  that process to ensure that they are fully informed and able to apply the level  of scrutiny that they have been doing.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  Given the recommendations made today about the way forward, when did the  Minister first have concerns about the Go-co model and how Northern Ireland  Water was being run, and when did the Minister last propose bonuses for the  chief executive?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: All parties expressed concerns about the Go-co model  in advance of 2007. As I said, it has been a controversial proposition. It was  part of direct rule. It was not simply about the idea of a separate double  taxation on water, which was part of the direct rule proposals, but there was a  very strong suspicion that NIW was being created as a company that was being  set up for privatisation. Therefore, there have always been concerns about the  Go-co model.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">What has specifically arisen as a result of this inquiry  are the ongoing governance issues at NIW. The issues that have been brought to  light, on top of other issues that gave concerns in the arrangements and  handling in NIW, have allowed us to look very carefully at those arrangements  in the short term to take whatever action is necessary &mdash; I listed a series of  actions that we have taken &mdash; and to make some proposals to the Executive. It is  up to an incoming Executive if they want to legislate properly for an entirely  new arrangement, but there are short-term measures that I can take.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I have made it clear many times that I am happy for the  Executive to look at the whole issue of pay, remuneration and bonuses across  the board. There is no point in doing it for one individual organisation in one  individual Department. The Finance Minister has also discussed those issues.  The sooner the Executive, particularly in the current climate, look at  salaries, bonuses and remuneration right across the board, the better for all  of us.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Leonard</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I welcome the statement, particularly  the indications for the longer-term structures, but how confident is the  Minister that the measures outlined today will help to resolve a lot of the  difficulties in the interim or shorter term?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I have already outlined actions that have been taken  on the back of the report from the independent team. That certainly increases  the Department&rsquo;s involvement in audit and its connection with NIW. Obviously,  there are measures that relate to procurement and advice to NIW senior staff  which I have listed. Certainly, as regards the potential conflict of a company  that is set up to operate under company law yet receives the vast majority of  its income from the Executive through public subsidy, I want to ensure that the  public interest in NIW takes precedence over any company law or regulatory  requirements in order to ensure that the public interest in the vast amounts of  money that NIW spends is maintained and protected. If necessary, I will take  measures in the short term to do that. Of course, I have outlined my view of  where NIW should go in the longer term as well.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I wonder whether the Minister remembers that he commissioned Professor Paddy  Hillyard to advise on the future of water services and accepted many of his  recommendations, not least that the Go-co structure would remain. Does he agree  that what he has announced today is, therefore, a total U-turn of his policy?  Does he accept that to come to the House during these times and admit to  exposing the region&rsquo;s taxpayers to potential costs of &pound;55 million each year is  probably not the best way to address what everyone agrees is a significant  crisis in Northern Ireland Water?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The Hillyard review was commissioned as soon as I  came into office. The Executive have had many discussions on NI Water. We have  discussed and accepted my proposition of deferral. That brings us into the  territory where we are at present. Of course, there are risks for NIW&rsquo;s  longer-term future with regard to the attitude that the Treasury might take to  it. The Executive need to discuss that issue. It is clear from the report that  I received, from the action that was taken and from the events that happened in  NI Water that it could not be left as it was. An option might have been to sit  and do nothing and, therefore, have no consequences flow from that. However, my  responsibility is to protect the public interest. I was elected to do so and  appointed to run the Department for Regional Development, of which NIW is a  component. Therefore, I need to highlight those issues, deal with them and take  action when evidence is presented to me. I must also discuss fully with the  Assembly, the Regional Development Committee and my Executive colleagues all  the consequences that flow from that.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: The  Minister has been fairly critical of NIW&rsquo;s current Go-co status. However, in  his statement, he acknowledged the company&rsquo;s achievements, which include  improved drinking water quality and waste water treatment and reduction in  leakages. Given that contrast, does he believe that another complete  restructuring of Northern Ireland Water is actually necessary?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Perhaps the Member is suggesting that NIW&rsquo;s  achievements would not have happened under any other structure: I believe that  they would have. As I said, we made a substantial investment of &pound;0&middot;75 billion  during the past three years. Any structure that operates in any way efficiently  to deliver projects on the ground would manage to improve the system. NIW has  done a good job to improve the water and sewerage infrastructure. That was  absolutely necessary. Continued investment is absolutely necessary. The issues  that have been thrown up, such as procurement; governance failures; the tension  between company law and the fact that NIW continues to receive the majority of  its money from the public purse, which was not the intention under direct rule;  and even the treatment of NIW as a Go-co under one sector and as an NDPB for  public expenditure purposes create a series of contradictions which I need to  address in the short term and either the current Executive or an incoming  Executive must address in the longer term.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bresland</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. There is considerable public concern  about what is going on in the Department. It is important for the Minister to  move to the appointment of new directors. What timetable and process does he  intend to follow?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I intend to start that process fairly soon. It will  take around six to nine months. It will be the standard process as approved and  laid down by the Commissioner for Public Appointments.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement,  especially the detail on the full range of issues surrounding the performance  of NI Water as a Go-co to date. I also welcome the fact that the Minister  intends to bring forward to the Executive proposals seeking cross-party support  on the future governance arrangements. The Minister&rsquo;s proposal to change the Go-co  to a public sector body which will operate on the basis of no household charges  and will not be set up to be privatised is also welcome news.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Please come to your question, Mr Boylan.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Will the Minister indicate when those proposals will be brought forward to the  Executive?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: There are short-term measures, some of which have  happened and some of which may require further action, including amendments to  legislation. I need to discuss those with departmental officials and with the  Regional Development Committee. It is important that we create some clear sense  of my view and the Executive&rsquo;s view on the longer-term future of NIW. There is  a time frame between now and the end of this mandate, during which I intend to  bring a paper to the Executive so that we can have a clear discussion on the  way forward.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  In his statement, the Minister referred to the interim appointments that were  made to the board, and he said that, due to the need for urgency in such  appointments, an emergency process that was subject to a demonstrable element  of independent participation was used. Will the Minister detail to the House  the exact process that was used in choosing those people? In response to a  question from my colleague Mr Bresland, the Minister said that the board  membership would be replaced in six to nine months.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Please come to your question, Mr McCrea.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  Will the Minister assure the House that that will take six to nine months  rather than the 14 months that it took to replace another member on the board?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The Commissioner for Public Appointments gave written  agreement to the running of an emergency appointments process for the interim  appointments, subject to a demonstrable element of independent participation  and the understanding that the appointments would be short-term. It was agreed  that a long list of possible candidates would be produced and potential  candidates would be contacted as soon as possible. The original aim was to get  four interim non-executive directors and an interim chairperson in place within  three to four weeks. If there was sufficient interest, a shortlist was to be  drawn up by a panel. The demonstrable element of independent participation was  to involve someone from outside the Department or outside NIW. Interviews or  conversations with a purpose would subsequently take place between the panel  and the shortlisted candidates and would be based on specific criteria. It was  emphasised that it was important to ensure that those individuals had a clear  track record of integrity, a demonstrable ability to challenge and no conflicts  of interest. It was hoped to find at least one individual with a strong public  sector governance background. Anyone being considered for the post of interim  chairperson also had to demonstrate strong leadership qualities and an ability  to deal effectively with external stakeholders. Recommendations were put to me  for consideration, and successful and unsuccessful candidates were notified and  appointments made.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">As I said to the Member&rsquo;s colleague, the intention is to  start the process for permanent appointments very soon. That will take six to  nine months and will be done in accordance with the procedures laid down by the  commissioner.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am grateful for the opportunity to ask the Minister a question on a statement  that was billed as one that would outline issues of governance in Northern Ireland.  Will the Minister justify how the statement has become almost a party political  manifesto with the objective of renationalising Northern Ireland Water? In view  of the fact that the mandate of this Assembly, the Executive and the Ministers  is due to end shortly and there are no guarantees that the Minister or his  party will continue to have responsibility for the Department for Regional  Development, how can the Minister justify the expenditure and the proposals  that he is outlining today?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I encourage the Member to finish.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  How can he do that not having acquainted any of his Executive colleagues of any  of that detail?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: As the Minister responsible, I am entitled to make  propositions in relation to an agency or an element or organisation in my  Department. That, as a political viewpoint, should not be surprising to the  Member, given that we all have political viewpoints to put forward.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The reason for bringing forward a proposition is quite  clear: all parties, including the Member&rsquo;s, took a position of hostility and  opposition to the creation of NIW and to the direct rule plans of which NIW was  a component part. The Executive have had many discussions about the matter,  and, since I came into office, I have had many discussions on it with the  Committee for Regional Development. Indeed, the Hillyard report provided one  such opportunity for discussion.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">There have been ongoing discussions about the deferral of  water charges and its consequences. The Executive will need to have continued  discussions on that matter. We are heading towards the end of this mandate, and  there is no certainty as to who will be in the Executive on the other side of  it or about which Executive positions they may take. Given the governance  failures that we have had, it is important to put matters right in the short  term. It is also important that the Executive take a clear view of how they  would like to see things happen in the longer term. That will be an important  base for any incoming Executive to start from.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as a r&aacute;iteas. I thank the Minister for his  statement. With regard to the referred-to independent review team on which he  based his decisions, will the Minister outline what declaration on any  potential for conflict of interest was either sought from members of that  review team by his Department or provided by them to his Department after or  before their appointment?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I sat down with the members of the review team before  I received the report. I was aware of some accusations, which have never been  substantiated and which, I noticed, the Member continues to promote, that there  was some lack of independence or some inappropriate relationships. I asked the  members of the review team clearly whether they were satisfied with the  independence of the report, with their ability to act independently and with  the evidence that they gathered and whether they could stand over any  conclusions that they reached. They assured me of all that.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. Will he give us details of any  conversations that he may have had with his permanent secretary about this  report when it was in draft form? Did any conversations take place? Did he ask  his permanent secretary whether the independent report needed to have much more  detail and specifics about who was at fault?</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Minister also talked about appointments that were made  as an interim measure, and he highlighted the fact that one of the criteria for  those appointments was that there should be no conflicts of interest. He used  urgent procedures to appoint an individual who had very clear connections to  his party. Is that not a conflict of interest?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: On the subject of conversations, when I asked for a  report from the independent review team, I was clear that I wanted a very clear  finding, whatever the consequences. I wanted people to have access to whatever  evidence they needed and to make very clear recommendations and findings on the  back of that. That is what I got.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The people who were appointed were asked whether they had  conflicts of interest in operating on the NIW board. If the Member wants to  start firing mud about some of the appointees, he should look into some of the  appointments that have been made by Departments run by his colleagues. People  had to demonstrate that they had no conflict of interest with the positions to  which they were appointed. I am satisfied about all that, and I am satisfied  with all five of the people who took up those posts. They have demonstrated a  high level of public service; those posts were not very easy to take up, and  the issue has been mired in a lot of difficulty. Those people are providing a  high level of service, and they will do so for the length of time that they are  required.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  The Minister&rsquo;s statement is to be welcomed. However, does he fully grasp the  situation and realise that we have a water service that, quite frankly, is not  fit for purpose? The Minister told us that the process will take between six  and nine months. It is a simple calculation to tell us that it will not happen  during this mandate. Can he assure us that he will place all resources at the  disposal of the Department to ensure that the consumer gets a water service  that is fit for purpose? After all, when the Water Service was reorganised some  few years ago, we were told that this was going to be a service that would  deliver. It is not delivering. I do not blame the Minister for that, because he  inherited the situation, but he should bring more pressure to bear to ensure  that the reorganisation and reform will be carried out during this mandate  rather than waiting for the next one.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The reports and the issue that we are dealing with  today relate to governance failures. At that level, there are failures that  need to be addressed, and we should not shirk dealing with them. We should  confront those failures and deal with them, whatever the consequences. NIW has  been doing a good job on the delivery of the water and sewerage infrastructure.  It certainly received a substantial amount of public money, but the water and  sewerage infrastructure has improved substantially, after decades of  underinvestment, and great credit is due to people in NIW for that.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Member spoke about the process of appointing permanent  directors taking six to nine months; that is not necessarily to do with the  process of changing the controls in the here and now. To legislate to undo the  substantial legislation that established NIW and all the processes around it,  which included some 300 articles, and to undertake the required consultation  properly would be beyond our time frame in this mandate. However, the Executive  should discuss and decide on what they consider to be a clear way forward so  that any incoming Executive have a clear picture about where to start.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  The Minister said that public sector interest overrules company law. That is a  sweeping statement that he needs to develop for the House to understand. He  previously stated that water charging is a decision to be taken by the  Executive; however, in his statement today, he clearly said that any new body  will not:</p>
<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;introduce separate water charges for households.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Is that a ministerial promise, or will it still be  left to the Executive to decide?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The Executive must decide on a range of issues. My  reply to the Member&rsquo;s first question about public sector interest outweighing  company law is that NIW was set up with the intention that it would be a fully  charging company early in the lifetime of this Executive. Therefore, the  regulations that apply to it were formulated on a basis that subsequently did  not happen. The substantial amount of money that NIW has to spend on water and  sewerage infrastructure comes from the public purse. Given that questions have  arisen about procurement practices and whether value for money is being  properly pursued by NIW and given that we are elected to protect the public  interest, we want to ensure that the substantial amount of money being given to  NIW by the Executive is properly scrutinised and accounted for. Therefore, the  public sector interest should take prominence.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I made my view clear and put a proposition to the Executive  for the continued deferral of water charges, which was supported, but there are  issues and consequences flowing from that that the Executive need to discuss  and decide on. I intend to bring some propositions to the Executive in the  coming period.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. The duty on the Minister is, first, to  protect the public interest by ensuring that there is a high-quality water  service &mdash; I notice that his statement refers to the need for continued major  investment &mdash; and, secondly, to protect the public purse. Can he convince the  Assembly that his longer-term intentions will satisfy both those issues? Is he  open to considering other models such as mutualisation? With the proposals that  he put forward today, is he not, in fact, committing to putting an additional  substantial charge for water on rates bills?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: No; I am not committing to anything of the sort. I am  committing to continuing to argue for investment in the water and sewerage  infrastructure because it is necessary. As I said and as, I am sure, the Member  will accept, there have been decades of neglect in our water and sewerage  infrastructure which had real environmental consequences for us as well as  consequences relating to the EU&rsquo;s imposition of fines for our poor standards.  It also had consequences relating to economic recovery because, if we do not  have the proper water and sewerage infrastructure, which is as important as all  other infrastructures, we cannot support economic recovery and growth. I will  continue to argue for investment for that. The steps that I am now taking and  the propositions that I intend to put to the Executive will secure the  protection of the public interest and of public finances in NIW, which will be  a matter for discussion in the longer term with my Executive colleagues.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lyttle</strong>:  The governance of NI Water has been of significant public concern in recent  times, so I thank the Minister for his statement to the House today. Does the  Minister believe that he can continue to deliver the improved service referred  to in his statement without the introduction of domestic water charges?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: As I said in my statement, &pound;0&middot;75 billion worth of  improvements have been delivered over the past three years without that.  Obviously, the finances available to the Executive are and will be challenged,  and they will want to discuss that issue. However, the need for continued  investment has never been disputed by any of my Executive colleagues during my  discussions with them. We are dealing with a legacy of underinvestment, and we  need to continue to invest because for a period we were one step ahead of  infraction costs from the EU. Thankfully, the investments that we have made  mean that we are somewhat clear of that now. However, there is not one MLA here  who has not written to me about some issue in and around water and sewerage  infrastructure and the need for improvements. That infrastructure is as  important as any other in assisting economic recovery.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Purvis</strong>:  The Minister referred to the independent review team, which I was assumed was  appointed by his accounting officer and the sub-accounting officer from  Northern Ireland Water. The Minister has clearly confirmed his support for the  independent review team and the outcome of its report. The report actually  states that governance frameworks were in place and that the board had driven  improvements in procurement and had received assurances from the executive  team. Given that the full board had just 10 meetings a year with Northern  Ireland Water, whereas the Department had over 80 meetings with it, and that  four audits, including an external audit, showed no issues with breaches in  procurement &mdash; this issue goes to the heart of future boards and public  appointments &mdash; will the Minister tell me, even though he sacked four out of the  five non-executive directors who were furthest removed from the actual  day-to-day running of Northern Ireland Water, what more the board could have  done in practical terms?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The Member quotes quite selectively from the report,  which states that over 70 contracts amounting to almost &pound;25 million were found  not to have been properly procured.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Purvis</strong>: <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Will the Member allow me to answer her question? I  consider that to be a very serious issue. I notice that the Member is shaking  her head. If she disputes the figures, perhaps she should come out and say  that. When those issues were put to board members and NIW as an organisation,  they were not disputed.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The central core issue is not and has not been disputed.  There has been a lot of innuendo, allegation and muck-slinging about the  independence and integrity of some of the people involved. However, the central  core issue that should concern the Assembly and any democratically elected  Member is that public money was being used to procure contracts not in the  fashion in which it was intended. That is of central interest to me. I am  elected to represent the public interest. Therefore, I undertook to have an  investigation and to deal with the outcome of that investigation, whatever the  consequences.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I appoint the non-executive directors to the board and need  to ensure that they represent the public interest through me on that board. I  must have confidence that they are doing their job and that when issues such as  that one are presented to them they will react correctly and responsibly and  will demonstrate their intention to continue to serve the public interest as  well as the interest of the Assembly and the people who elect us. I did not  have confidence in four of the five directors, and I took what I considered to  be appropriate action.</p>
<p class="H4StageHeading" style="page-break-before:always;"><a name="a6" id="a6"></a>North/South  Ministerial Council: Education Sectoral Format</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice from the Minister of Education that she wishes to make a  statement.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education (Ms Ruane)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. In advance  of my statement about the NSMC meeting in education sectoral format on 23 June,  it would be remiss of me as Minister of Education not to report to the Assembly  on the position regarding the security alerts and recent attacks on schools. I  am sure that all Members join me in saying that attacks should not be happening  in schools. I assure Members that my Department is doing everything that it can  to support schools in whatever they need and ensuring that all information is  provided to the PSNI. It is simply not acceptable that that happens in our  schoolyards and our children are put at risk. I thank the Speaker for his  indulgence.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">12.45 pm</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Le do chead, a Cheann Comhairle, ba mhian liom r&aacute;iteas a  thabhairt maidir le cruinni&uacute; de chuid na Comhairle Aireachta Thuaidh/Theas i  bhform&aacute;id na hearn&aacute;la oideachais. Tion&oacute;ladh an cruinni&uacute; seo in Ardscoil Naomh  Marcas, Rinn Mhic Giolla Ruaidh, ar 23 Meitheamh 2010.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I wish to make a statement on a meeting of the North/South  Ministerial Council in education sectoral format, which was held in St Mark&rsquo;s  High School, Warrenpoint on 23 June 2010. I extend my thanks to Michele Corkey  and her team for hosting us. I, as Minister of Education, represented the  Executive, along with the Minister for Employment and Learning, Reg Empey MLA.  The Irish Government were represented by Mary Coughlan, T&aacute;naiste and Minister  for Education and Skills. The statement has been agreed with Reg Empey and is  made on behalf of us both.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Tabharfaidh m&eacute; achoimre ar na pr&iacute;omhphoint&iacute; a ndearnadh pl&eacute;  orthu ag an chruinni&uacute;, thar na r&eacute;ims&iacute; comhaontaithe ar fad maidir le comhoibri&uacute;  san earn&aacute;il oideachais.</p>
<p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I will summarise the main points from the meeting, which  range across all the agreed areas of education co-operation. The North/South  Ministerial Council noted that progress had been made in a number of areas  relating to educational underachievement, including: the continuing work on  Traveller education, such as the conclusion of consultations with Travellers,  which will inform the recommendations of the task force on Traveller education;  the launch of preschool, post-primary and special toolkits for diversity to  support teachers in schools in meeting the needs of newcomer pupils and their  parents; the progress made by the joint working group on educational  underachievement, including an exploration of the scope to develop links  between schemes that involve business working with schools; the positive report  of the joint post-primary numeracy conference, which highlighted the benefits  of collaborative professional development and the sharing of best practice; the  progress being made to prepare for an all-Ireland children&rsquo;s book week in the  autumn; and the conference planned for 2011 on the theme of schools supporting  parents to support children&rsquo;s literacy, which will be a follow-up to the  children&rsquo;s book week.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We welcomed presentations from practitioners and officials  on targeted programmes aimed at tackling educational underachievement in  disadvantaged communities. The first was given by two of our outstanding head  teachers, Johnny Graham from Belfast Model School  for Girls and Jim Keith from Belfast Boys&rsquo; Model school in north Belfast, along with Gerry McMahon, project manager of the  Full Service Community Network in west Belfast.  They shared with us their thoughts on the role and on the success to date of  the network&rsquo;s programmes in helping children to achieve their full potential.  Jim Mulkerrins from the Department of Education and Skills gave a presentation  on DEIS, the delivering equality of opportunity in schools programme, which is  an integrated school programme for tackling disadvantage in the South.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Chuir an Chomhairle f&aacute;ilte roimh athbhun&uacute; an ghr&uacute;pa oibre  um ch&aacute;il&iacute;ochta&iacute; m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; agus an dul chun cinn at&aacute; d&eacute;anta cheana f&eacute;in le  comhoibri&uacute; a thabhairt chun cinn ar cheisteanna a bhaineann le hoideachas  m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; i gcoitinne agus go h&aacute;irithe i dtaca leis an Ghaelscola&iacute;ocht de.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Council welcomed the reconstitution of the teacher  qualifications working group and the progress already made in taking forward  co-operation on teacher education issues generally and on Irish-medium  education in particular. We welcomed the additional measures that are now in  place to strengthen co-ordination and co-operation on school leadership and  Irish-medium education, including a commitment to share, where possible,  materials and resources to avoid duplication.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Chuir na hAir&iacute; f&aacute;ilte roimh an r&oacute;l t&aacute;bhachtach at&aacute; ag  malartuithe idir na cigireachta&iacute; sa d&aacute; Roinn Oideachais a thaca&iacute;onn le forbairt  lean&uacute;nach chleachtas na cigireachta sa d&aacute; dhl&iacute;nse.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Ministers also welcomed the contribution of exchanges  between the inspectorates of both Departments of education to supporting the  continuing development of inspection practice in the two jurisdictions. We  noted that, in 2010, the Standing Committee on Teacher Education North and  South (SCoTENS) subcommittee approved seed funding grants for a range of  topics.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Chuir an Chomhairle f&aacute;ilte roimh an dul chun cinn lean&uacute;nach  at&aacute; &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh ag Ionad Uathachais Choillidh Chanann&aacute;in, lena n-&aacute;ir&iacute;odh:  athcheapadh an Bhoird go ceann tr&eacute;imhse eile tr&iacute; bliana; t&uacute;s le pac&aacute;ist&iacute; breise  oili&uacute;na ar fud an oile&aacute;in; agus comhairle agus treoir a tugadh do na  scoileanna, agus taigdhe agus seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; lean&uacute;nacha eolais agus dheimhnigh an  Chomhairle a taca&iacute;ocht lean&uacute;nach d&rsquo;iarrachta&iacute; an Ionaid agus an d&aacute; Roinn  Oideachais le plean ilbhliant&uacute;il a cheapadh le haghaidh fhorbairt an Ionaid sa  todhcha&iacute;.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The council welcomed the continuing progress made by the  Middletown Centre for Autism, including the reappointment of the board for a  further three-year term, the rolling out of further training packages across  the island, and the provision of advice and guidance to schools and ongoing  research and information services and expressed its continued support for the  efforts of the centre and the education Department for a multiannual plan for  the development of the centre.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Thug an Chomhairle d&aacute; h-aire go n-&aacute;ir&iacute;tear athbhreithni&uacute; ar  chomhoibri&uacute; i r&eacute;imse na malartuithe oideachas&uacute;la sa chomhstaid&eacute;ar cuimsitheach  ar Chomhoibri&uacute; Thuaidh/Theas san Oideachas at&aacute; faoi l&aacute;nseol agus t&aacute; an  Chomhairle ag tn&uacute;th le tuairisc chun d&aacute;ta a fh&aacute;il ar an dul chun cinn sa r&eacute;imse  ag cruinni&uacute; eile amach anseo.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The council noted that a review of co-operation in  education exchanges is included in the comprehensive joint study of North/South  co-operation in education currently under way and looks forward to receiving a  further update on progress in that area at a future meeting. We also noted the  engagement between the two Departments and the IBEC-CBI Joint Business Council  in developing an enterprise strand in the dissolving boundaries project and the  fact that both Departments are planning to conduct an evaluation of the  programme, including its outcomes and benefits. We agreed that the next meeting  of the North/South Ministerial Council in education sectoral format should take  place in November 2010.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Ar deireadh, shocraigh muid gur ch&oacute;ir an ch&eacute;ad chruinni&uacute;  eile den Chomhairle Aireachta Thuaidh/Theas i bhform&aacute;id na hearn&aacute;la oideachais  a thion&oacute;l i m&iacute; na Samhna 2010.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind Members that questions to the Minister should be on the  statement made today.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education (Mr Storey)</strong>: I add my words of condemnation  to those of the Minister about the recent attacks on the schools in Antrim and  the attack on a young boy by other pupils in Coleraine. What happened in that  particular incident will become clearer over the next few days. All those  attacks are to be condemned and should not be taking place.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">With regard to the Minister&rsquo;s statement on the meeting of  the North/South Ministerial Council in education sectoral format, I note the  progress that the Minister claims for the joint working group on educational  underachievement, including numeracy. However, will the Minister tell the House  the current status of that scheme and what information she conveyed to the  joint working group at the meeting in September about the revised literacy and  numeracy strategy for pupils in Northern    Ireland, given that we have been waiting one  year and 11 months since the public consultation of that strategy? Does the  Minister still believe that she has an important input to the North/South  Ministerial Council meeting and that she has relevant information to bring to  it on numeracy and literacy?</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Middletown Centre for Autism is an issue of grave  importance to many Members. The Committee for Education received a written  briefing from education officials last week. They reported that only two of the  four planned services at Middletown  are operational and that the key educational assessment service has yet to  commence although the centre was given the go-ahead for that back in 2002.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Committee also heard that a capital bid for Middletown  of &pound;3&middot;2 million has been included in the Minister&rsquo;s spending plans for 2011-12,  yet the Department of Education and the Department of Education and Skills in  the Republic are still reviewing their capital spend, and the latter has not  confirmed its 50% commitment to the capital contribution for Middletown. Will  the Minister inform the House why her officials and Department are undertaking  a review of the Middletown Centre for Autism if, as the report before us today  tells us, progress is being made?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Go raibh maith agat as na ceisteanna sin. I join the Member in  condemning any attacks on children, regardless of where they emanate from. If  the Member has information on such attacks, I would like him to bring it to me  and to the relevant authorities at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">As the House knows, since becoming Minister, I have made it  a priority to tackle underachievement, promote equality and raise standards in  all our schools. I am pleased that we are making progress and that standards  are improving. In 2006, before I took up office, over 12,000 young people a  year left school without having achieved five or more good GCSEs, including  English and Maths. The data from 2009, which is the most recent available,  shows that that number fell to around 9,500. That is still far too high, but  there has been a significant decrease because of the range of policies that I  have put in place. We need to close the gap, and I have been in schools  throughout the summer, some of which have increased the percentage of children  who achieve five good GCSEs to 88%. That is a phenomenal performance by those  schools, but, sadly, there are still schools that are not achieving the  standards that they should, because of systemic failure in the past.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We need to ensure that we raise the standards of  performance by all our young people in all our schools. As Members know, I am  putting in place policies aimed at raising standards for each and every child  and tackling underachievement wherever it exists. Those policies include the  school improvement policy. Members will be glad to hear that I met Bob  Salisbury last week to discuss the literacy and numeracy report, which was  written by the task force that he chaired. Other such policies include Every  School a Good School; transfer 2010, which is tasked with ending the deep  inequality in our system; the revised curriculum and entitlement framework; the  literacy and numeracy strategy; the review of special educational needs and  inclusion and the early years strategy; support for newcomer and traveller  children; the extended and full-service programmes; and the Achieving Derry and  Achieving Belfast programmes.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Through the North/South Ministerial Council, I am working  to tackle educational underachievement, because underachievement is an area of  co-operation. Some of the best events and sharing of good practice have taken  place on a North/South basis in such places as Sligo,  Cavan and Enniskillen. Those events brought together teachers to look at  specific issues, such as numeracy in primary schools, teaching maths in a way  that keeps children stimulated, literacy and the sharing of good practice  between teachers across the island.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Members know that research into literacy and numeracy has  shown the powerful impact of parental involvement. Even the simple act of  reading to a child is powerful. It is important that each of us uses our good  offices to encourage parents to engage with their children every night, to read  to them and to encourage them to develop a love of books. That is important  because 70% of a child&rsquo;s learning takes place in the home and in the community,  whereas 30% takes place in schools. There must be partnership between the  school, the home and the community. That is what is very beneficial about the  Full Service School Network in west Belfast and  in the Belfast model  schools, where the three areas come together.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I will publish the revised literacy and numeracy strategy  in the coming weeks, and I look forward to Members&rsquo; support for that important  document. We have taken the time to make sure that we get that important  strategy right. We have been working hard to address the issues raised during  the consultation, and the Education Committee has already seen a summary of the  consultation responses. We have also been working to align the strategy with  other key developments, including the introduction of place assessment  arrangements to support the revised curriculum, and those have a specific focus  on progress in literacy and numeracy.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">In relation to the Member&rsquo;s third question, the Middletown  Centre for Autism is a very important project, and, as the Member knows,  funding for the purchase and running costs of the centre has been provided on a  50:50 basis.<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
<p class="B3BodyText">My Department&rsquo;s expenditure on the project currently stands  at approximately &pound;2&middot;36 million revenue and &pound;1&middot;79 million capital, and there are  &pound;428,000 of project costs from 2001 to date. As agreed at the North/South  Ministerial Council meeting in Limavady in December, the two Departments are  working on a phased, multi-annual plan for the future development of the centre.  My officials have met with their counterparts in the Department of Education  and Skills on a number of occasions to discuss the development of this plan,  and they will continue to do so to progress this issue as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I remain committed to the Middletown project so that we can offer much  needed educational support to some of the most vulnerable children, and I look  forward to having the support of all parties and Members. The centre already  provides two services: first, a training and advisory service for parents,  teachers and other professionals; and secondly, the centre&rsquo;s training schedule  for the current academic year continues with over 4,000 individuals, mainly  educational professionals and a number of health professionals and members of  the voluntary sector. Many of us heard the reports this morning of the young  man with Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome and the questions that were asked as to whether  his needs are being met. A project such as that in Middletown is a very valuable project-sharing  practice across the island. It also has a research and information service. It  was planned that the Middletown  centre would provide two further services &mdash; an education assessment service and  a learning support service. In advance of the education assessment and learning  support services being rolled out, the centre is delivering advice and guidance  that is for the support of children in the North and that focuses on parental  training in the South. Members will be pleased to know that I will continue to  work very closely with my colleague in the South, Mary Coughlan, as well as  with my officials, to advance that project.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I think the Chairperson of the  Education Committee might have asked all the questions, if possible.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">1.00 pm</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Will the Minister outline further  what lessons have been learned from the full service network that is operating  in schools in Belfast  and in Deis schools, which are operating across the 26 counties? What further  lessons can we learn from those for education?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: As I said, at the North/South meeting, we had a very good  comprehensive report from some of the best school leaders right across the island of Ireland. In the North, as you know, we  have the full service concept, which is designed to improve the educational  outcomes and life chances of disadvantaged children and young people through  the delivery of integrated support services and interventions that help to  overcome barriers to learning.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">My Department is funding the Belfast Education and Library  Board and CCMS to pilot two full service programmes as part of our continuing  efforts to address the needs of disadvantaged communities and to narrow the  achievement gap. The first programme is the full service school at the Belfast  Boys&rsquo; Model School  and the Belfast Model  School for Girls in north Belfast, and the second is  the full service community network in Ballymurphy. The provision goes beyond  extended school programmes by enabling key agencies and services to come  together to maximise services not just for schoolchildren but for their  families and the whole community.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Both pilot programmes offer access to cohesive and  integrated specialist support services that are aimed at addressing the  particular needs of pupils, their families and the wider community on a range  of social issues. They are delivered collaboratively with other schools and  with a range of statutory agencies and voluntary and community groups. The  Model schools employ a more reactive approach, in that they organise and bring  together appropriate sources of professional help and support in response to identified  needs. The full service network in Ballymurphy has a slightly different  strategy, in that key stakeholders across the statutory, voluntary and  community sectors are involved at the outset, playing an active role in the  planning of full service activities and services through representation on the  full service community network project board. The principals on both projects  work closely together so that they can learn from each other.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">An Deis in the South has a slightly different approach, but  again, it does similar work. It works in schools in disadvantaged areas to make  sure that they have breakfast clubs, school book schemes and that they  encourage whole school approaches to literacy and numeracy. &ldquo;Deis&rdquo; is the Irish  word for &ldquo;opportunity&rdquo;. I speak for Reg Empey and me when I say that I think  that everybody found the presentation very useful. We have a lot of lessons to  learn.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The key issue is parental involvement. If we could get one  message out to every parent, it would be that their role in school education is  fundamental. It makes a difference to the young people who achieve and to those  who do not. We must provide more support to parents.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I will start by saying how pleasant it is to be back in the bosom of my  colleagues.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  Your one colleague. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I join other colleagues in condemning absolutely the atrocious attacks on  schools. None of us thinks that that is the way forward, and we are together in  dealing with the issue.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Minister brought up the issue of education  underachievement. She mentioned that she had received a number of interesting  presentations from very learned people. Will she tell us what she learned  specifically from those presentations, because this is all a bit woolly? What  key elements did she take from those presentations? Does she think that they  will change her position on the early years strategy?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I thank the Member for his question and for his well-made point.  The key element that I took out of the presentations, as did the principals of  the schools from very disadvantaged areas across the island of Ireland,  is having a targeted, strategic approach. It is about schools, community  groups, parents and young people working together. Young people are at the core  of that.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The other element that is coming up with many principals  and which they are raising with me is that, in the North, we do not have a  revised curriculum that is corrupted by transfer, and that young people are  learning in a more stimulated, rather than high-pressure, way. We are already  starting to see some of the benefits. We have now had two years without  transfer and without the key primary-school years being used to distort the  curriculum, which placed some children at the back of the class and others at the  front being drilled for tests that many of us believe they should not have been  doing in the first place. The key approach is to have agencies working together  from the earliest point.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I am not sure that I understand the second part of the  Member&rsquo;s question about the early years strategy. We all know that the key  point is early intervention. It is about all Departments working together to  tackle underachievement and deal with raising standards, whether it is the  Departments of Health, Education, or the Department for Social Development.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her statement. The SDLP joins everyone in condemning  the attacks on schools and incidents of assaults on pupils.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Minister mentioned investment in the Middletown Centre:  the figure that she referred to was close to &pound;5 million. Will she acknowledge  that many parents with autistic children are very frustrated at the lack of  support in schools in relation to statementing and other classroom support, and  lack of support in the home where necessary? The development of the Middletown  Centre seems a very long way from where they are. A new plan has been agreed:  will the Minister tell us whether, in a year from now, the parents that I refer  to will see any appreciable difference in their circumstances?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: First, I acknowledge a lot of the good work that is being done  in our schools on autism and for children on the autistic spectrum. Of course,  there is not enough work going on.</p>
<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">We need to continue to train professionals and to  have multidisciplinary teams so that teachers, classroom assistants, parents,  children and psychologists can work together in a strategic and co-ordinated  way, because that, ultimately, is how we will achieve real changes and enable  young people on the autistic spectrum to reach their full potential. That is  what a parent wants for his or her child. To do that, we must continue to  invest in special education needs, the Middletown Centre for Autism, school  psychology programmes and in the range of programmes that are in place.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I look forward to the support of all Members when I ask for  resources from the Executive, on which all of the parties here are represented.  We should prioritise funding to ensure that it goes to front line services,  whether those are in health, education or other Departments. The key test of  the Executive will be their targeting of front line services and ensuring that  young disadvantaged people do not bear the brunt of difficult times. I look  forward to Members&rsquo; support in that regard.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: I  join other Members in condemning the attacks on schools in the past week or  two. The Minister confirmed that she is satisfied with the progress to date on  the Middletown Centre for Autism and with the commitment of both Governments. Does  she share the concerns, to which Mr Gallagher referred, of parents and  representative organisations, such as Autism NI? They still fear that Middletown may not be the  ideal model.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: It is not a one-size-fits-all model; the boards use many  different strategies. We work on a North/South basis and share good practice in  dealing with young people on the autistic spectrum. Many parents believe that  it is essential for some of the most highly trained professionals to be  involved in the approach that is taken to their young people. Any parents to  whom I have spoken want a co-ordinated approach among teachers, classroom  assistants, education psychologists, health professionals and services that are  provided by boards or any other organisation. That is the key intervention that  must happen.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">My Department works closely with its counterpart in the  South of Ireland to ensure the expansion of the services that are provided. I  said that I was pleased with the first two areas that we have brought forward  in relation to the training of the 4,000 professionals. Parents are also pleased,  and they are already reaping the benefit. However, parents and I want the  development of the centre to continue, along with various approaches in other  parts of the North of Ireland. My Department works with various organisations  that represent parents.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: There has been a full round of questions from all of the parties,  and I have been fairly lenient on statements and questions. However, Members  should speed up the process through asking precise questions.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  Have key performance indicators been set for the incoming board of the Middletown centre? If so,  are they challenging? Will the Minister clarify whether her Department is  undertaking a review of the centre? Finally, have the Government of the Irish Republic  confirmed their 50% capital contribution?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Given that we are under time constraints, I will answer the  first question: my Department always sets challenging targets for any board  that is appointed.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle &mdash;</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: Answer the second question. This is  absolutely pathetic.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  The Minister&rsquo;s statement referred to developments on teacher qualifications and  superannuation. Will she provide the House with an update on any progress on  initial teacher training programmes in the Twenty-six Counties?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: At present, the Teaching Council in Ireland  recognises Irish-medium programmes that are delivered by St Mary&rsquo;s University College  and some courses that are delivered by the University of Ulster.  Teachers who graduate from other teacher education courses in the North are required  to pay an additional fee to the Teaching Council of Ireland to have their  qualifications accredited and recognised. I have written to the Teaching  Council of Ireland regarding the matter, and the teaching councils North and  South are exploring the possibility of introducing a more streamlined process  to recognise each other&rsquo;s teaching qualifications.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">1.15 pm</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">In relation to the Member&rsquo;s question about teachers&rsquo;  superannuation, recent additions to the list of qualifying recognised overseas  pension schemes and reciprocal developments in the South of Ireland should  facilitate the transfer of the value of teachers&rsquo; accrued pension entitlements  from one jurisdiction to the other, and information plans have been drawn up to  assist teachers in weighing up their options. The North/South secretariat has  since facilitated an information event, at which the two education Departments  outlined the most recent information to the main teachers&rsquo; unions in all of Ireland.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>:  The Minister will be aware that a number of primary schools in my constituency  are home to the children of quite a large number of British Army personnel. The  Minister touched on working on the education of Travellers. Does she recognise  the transient nature of Army personnel and the difficulties that that creates  when their children arrive late in schools? Furthermore, allowing schools to  accommodate such short-notice changes creates funding problems. In the  consultation on transient children, what efforts has the Minister made to work  with the British Army to address the problem?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: The Member will be aware &mdash; or, by the sound of his question,  maybe he is not &mdash; that schools that have children with parents in the British  Army get extra money. On my watch, all children will be treated fairly. I draw  the Member&rsquo;s attention to the fact that it is not a North/South issue, because,  thankfully, we do not have the British Army in the South of Ireland. My  statement was a North/South report.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Will the Minister confirm that the Irish Government will provide 50% of the  capital funding? In the interests of speed, a yes or no answer will be fine.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: T&aacute; m&eacute; ag obair leis an Roinn sa Deisceart, agus t&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go  mbeidh an t-airgead ag Rialtas na h&Eacute;ireann agus ag mo Roinn.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Is that a yes or a no?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I will explain what I said. I am working with the Government in  the South of Ireland, and I hope &mdash;</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Is that a no?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: No, it is not a no. I have said clearly that I believe in the  importance of the centre, and I look forward to working with my colleagues in  the South to continue to expand it. Sin &eacute;.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  Following the evaluation of the Dissolving Boundaries programme, what can the  Minister tell us about funding for the project? Will she assure Members that  funding will not be cut?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Both Departments are planning to evaluate the Dissolving  Boundaries programme. The Education and Training Inspectorate (ETI) has already  scheduled its evaluation, which will commence in September/October 2010, and it  hopes to have the draft evaluation as soon as possible after that date, possibly  in early November. The Department of Education and Skills in Dublin will undertake a similar evaluation of  schools in the South, and, as part of that process, it will liaise with the  inspectorate. The ETI report will be made available to DES inspectors in due  course, and both Departments will liaise on the evaluation reports. The  programme is very important, and some very interesting work is going on.  However, I am sure that the Member is not asking me to pre-empt an important  evaluation.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  add my name to those who condemned attacks on schools and pupils. The Minister  spoke about educational achievement. Before recess, the Chairman of the  Committee for Education and I visited the nurture unit in Ballysally Primary School  in Coleraine. That project is very cost-effective and successful. At the NSMC  meeting, did the Minister discuss nurture units or similar projects, and what  is her view of them?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Obviously, I will not comment on individual schools. Suffice to  say I have very good memories of my visit to Ballysally Primary School,  and I wish it all the best in the new year. As the Member knows, my Department  wants to hear from all Members; it wants people to participate actively in  providing what people here believe are good approaches for early years. I am  not going to comment on specific approaches. However, it is essential that we  prioritise resources going to early years. Members will be aware that we added  extra money on top of the money that we approved this year. Again, we should be  focusing on North/South issues: we have an awful lot to learn from what is  happening in the South and vice versa. If the Member has any ideas on how we  can approach North/South issues and on how we can learn from each other, I  would very much welcome them.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Anderson</strong>:  For the third time, I ask the Minister to clarify whether her Department is  carrying out a review of the Middletown  centre.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I have already very clearly answered that question.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>:  I, too, want to be associated with the remarks made about damage to schools.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">There has been much talk about the underachievement of  young people. What percentage of young people is the Minister talking about?  The Minister should be careful about putting a label on any young person.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I never put a label on any young person, and I do not understand  where the question is coming from. Our young people need to be at the centre of  education provision. Everyone needs to be working for them, rather than the  other way round or having them fit into any type of institution. We need to  meet the needs of every child in our system so that they can reach their full  potential. I have never labelled any child, nor will I.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: At  the risk of doing what Jeremy Paxman did to Michael Howard, for the fourth  time, I ask the Minister to answer with a straight yes or no whether her  Department is undertaking a review of the Middletown  centre? Make it easy and just answer yes or no.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: My Department is working with the Government in the South of  Ireland so that we can carry forward the centre at Middletown.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">T&aacute;im ag obair leis &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I do not think that people should be playing politics with  special needs children and this important North/South project.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. The Minister has the Floor to answer questions, and Members  have the Floor to ask questions. We cannot have interruptions across the Floor.  I ask Members to abide by the rules.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lyttle</strong>: I  strongly agree with the Minister that improving parental involvement is key to  tackling educational underachievement. I welcome the announcement of the  all-island children&rsquo;s book week. How will details of that week be communicated  to local schools? Will organisations such as Booktrust be involved?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: The book week will feature events and workshops that engage  pupils and their parents in reading. I absolutely agree with the Member that it  is essential for parents to be involved in reading with their children. Plans  for the week, which will take place from 18 to 22 October, are close to being  finalised, and I will forward information to all Members shortly. If the Member  would like me to forward information to any groups, I will be happy to do so,  and he should give their addresses to my Department.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Speaker</strong>: That concludes questions to the Minister on her statement.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Today, before the House commenced its  business, the Speaker clearly indicated that when a Minister makes a statement  to the House and Members ask questions of that Minister, he expects questions  and not statements. An exception would, perhaps, be made for the Chairperson of  a Committee, who would be allowed some latitude. That was a timely reminder,  particularly as we return from the summer recess, because Members might be  prone to forgetting the protocol of the House. However, does the same rule  apply to ministerial replies, or do Ministers have latitude in that they do not  have to answer questions or can take as long as they like to answer them? I  would like a situation to develop whereby Ministers answer questions as  succinctly and precisely as possible. Obviously, that is not happening.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: My understanding is that an attempt was made to place a time limit  on ministerial replies but that that was not agreed to. The Member will know  that the Committee on Procedures is considering the issue of ministerial replies.  However, the current procedure is that questions are asked of Ministers, and  they reply to them.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">A number of times today, I asked Members to ask questions  rather than making statements, and, after the first round of questions to the  Minister, I made Members aware that I would not be as flexible as I had  previously been. I hope that that answers the Member&rsquo;s question.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  Further to that point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, I hear what you say.  However, do you not have considerable discretion in reminding Ministers that  they are here to answer questions? Do you not also have the discretion to  ensure that Ministers answer questions as succinctly as possible and do not  give the House, with all due respect, the load of waffle it sometimes receives?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: My hands are tied as to how anyone answers a question in the  House. The Speaker&rsquo;s remarks earlier today were addressed to all Members.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: Further to that point of order, Mr Deputy  Speaker, will you refer to the Speaker your comments on interventions and the  latitude that you claimed to have given to Members? You have a list of the  Members who were to be called to speak, and I request that the Speaker looks at  the comments that you made and what the Minister subsequently said.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. The Member should resume his seat. I am not questioning the  Speaker&rsquo;s ruling. The Speaker&rsquo;s door is open to anyone who has a query on  anything that he or I have said. I am certain that he will take up the matter.</p>
<p class="H4StageHeading" style="page-break-before:always;"><a name="a7" id="a7"></a>Review of Access to  Justice</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I have received notice from the Minister of Justice that he wishes  to make a statement.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice (Mr Ford)</strong>: With permission, I wish to make a statement on access to  justice. The devolution of justice powers offers Northern Ireland many benefits and  opportunities. Among those are the opportunities to identify local solutions to  local needs and to look afresh and to adopt approaches that will better serve  our community. Ultimately, it gives us the opportunity to reshape our justice  system to fit the needs of Northern    Ireland. With that in mind, and as Members  will know, I indicated my intention on 7 June to commission a fundamental  review to help to develop our thinking on how best to ensure access to justice  for the least well-off in our society. At that time, I undertook to set out my  plans for that review to the Assembly, and my statement today fulfils that  commitment.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I want to build a system of justice in Northern Ireland  that meets the needs of everyone. In criminal cases, we need and deserve a  system that works for all &mdash; victims, witnesses and defendants &mdash; and which gives  everyone confidence that the system works. I welcome the announcement by the  Lord Chief Justice last week that he wants to hear what people think about  sentencing for certain types of crimes, and I support his initiative. We also  need and deserve a civil justice system that provides an effective and accessible  way to resolve many different kinds of legal disputes. Of course, criminal and  civil cases need to proceed without delay.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Members will be aware that work is already under way to  address the urgent need to align legal aid expenditure with the available  budget for it, and, in the coming weeks, I intend to commence public  consultation on proposals to achieve that. I am grateful to the Bar Council and  the Law Society for their engagement on that issue, which has helped us to  develop home-grown proposals that provide a best fit for Northern Ireland.  I hope that the consultation exercise will achieve the highest level of  agreement on how to secure the required reduction in expenditure. I also  welcome the Bar Council&rsquo;s initiative to encourage its members to undertake  cases under the existing arrangements, thereby avoiding any disruption in the  courts.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The review that I am announcing today is more fundamental  than an exercise in cost control. Rather, it is an exercise to examine how best  we can help people to secure access to justice. Fair and effective access to  justice is an essential element of getting justice right. It is also critical  in building confidence and is an important part of our vision for a future  justice system. Our present system is built around providing financial  assistance to those who could not otherwise find the money to pay for legal  representation. However, there may be other approaches and better ways to use  the available funds.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">1.30 pm</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The terms of reference that I have set for the review are  as follows: to review legal aid provision in Northern Ireland and to develop  proposals to improve access to justice that will: ensure that defendants have  adequate representation to secure the right to a fair trial in criminal cases;  in civil cases, provide adequate, appropriate, efficient and cost-effective  mechanisms for resolving legal disputes, whether by action in the courts or  otherwise; examine previous review work to determine what recommendations and  proposals remain relevant; examine the scope for alternative approaches and  structures, as set out in my speech of 7 June; make proposals for an efficient  and cost-effective system of administration to develop policy and support  access to justice; and make proposals to achieve value for money in the use of  public funds within the available budget, including the identification of  possible future savings to reduce the legal aid budget.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased to inform the Assembly that the review will  commence today and will be carried out by Mr Jim Daniell, who is standing down  as chairman of the Legal Services Commission to lead the review. As Members  will be aware, Mr Daniell previously chaired the review of criminal justice in Northern Ireland  which flowed from the Good Friday Agreement. That, and his more recent  experience of chairing the Northern Ireland Legal Services Commission, makes  him the ideal person to carry out the review.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Although I have set the terms of reference of the review,  it will be independent. I have asked for a preliminary report to be provided by  the end of February 2011 and a final report by the end of May 2011. I  particularly want the review to consider new ideas and new ways of doing things  and to include thinking that is radical and innovative. I want to look at how  we help people solve problems and disputes, without necessarily bringing those  disputes into the courts, and how we can support people through the justice  process. Although we must ensure that access to legal representation will  always be available to those who need it, we should try to find ways of  avoiding the costly, adversarial and often stressful experience of a court  hearing in favour of alternative methods of resolving disputes.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I want the review to consider ideas, proposals and  constructive criticism from as many people, groups and organisations as  possible. I know that the voluntary sector will have an important contribution  to make to the review, as will the legal profession and the statutory agencies  that are involved in the justice system. However, I want everyone to have a  say, because everyone should have a voice in how the justice system works.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The review of access to justice will play an important part  in developing our vision for justice in Northern Ireland and in securing  justice for all. I look forward to bringing its conclusions to the Assembly in  due course.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Justice (Lord Morrow)</strong>: I thank the Justice Minister  for his statement. I also thank him for making the statement available very  early for Members to look at. That is a good habit that he will perhaps  continue, which is important.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Justice has spent considerable time over  the past months considering the current proposals to reduce legal aid  expenditure. We have one of the most expensive legal aid systems in Europe, which is obviously unsustainable.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is conscious of the need to ensure that the  principle of access to justice is central to any proposed changes. I am,  therefore, concerned that the Minister referred to the current proposals to  reform the legal aid system as &ldquo;an exercise in cost control&rdquo;. Will he assure  the House that the proposed changes are not just a money-saving exercise and  that full account has been made to ensure fair access to justice? I am sure  that the Justice Committee will consider that point carefully when we look at  the proposals.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I will move on to the fundamental review that the Minister  has just outlined. What account will Mr Daniell take of the available legal aid  budget when carrying out the review and reaching his conclusions? Will he be  restricted to ensuring his findings can be delivered within the available  budget, or has he been given a blank sheet or a blank cheque? Also, is Mr  Daniell completing the review on his own, or will he have assistance? If it is  the latter, what size of team will be appointed and what is the estimated cost  of the review, including accommodation and secretariat support?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I thank the Chairman for his kind words. Ministers do not always  receive such words at the start of a response to a statement. It is certainly  my intention to ensure that Members get details of statements with as much  notice as possible. However, I cannot promise that my staff will always supply  the questions and answers at the end of it.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">At the moment, we are in slight difficulty. Today, I am  announcing a fundamental review of legal aid as we are proceeding through the  process of dealing with the necessary cuts in legal aid expenditure that flow  from the agreement between the First Minister and deputy First Minister and the  former Prime Minister last year that led to the devolution of justice. As  Members will be aware, that agreement requires legal aid expenditure to be cut  from &pound;104 million to &pound;79 million by 2013-14. That issue is absolutely clear,  and it has to be addressed at the present time.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The review is not a cost-cutting measure, and no  instructions to that effect have been given to Mr Daniell. The terms of  reference include value for money but specifically make it clear that we want  to find appropriate and better ways to ensure access to justice in both civil  and criminal cases in the future. We will, obviously, take account of the  question of costs as we seek to explore future budgeting arrangements in the  Department of Justice and everywhere else.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Lord Morrow asked a specific question about cost. My  understanding is that the estimated total cost will be &pound;142,000, including Mr  Daniell&rsquo;s salary, various expenses, two members of staff and the necessary  accommodation for them to support him in his work.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as a  r&aacute;iteas. I thank the Minister for his statement. I must have got the second  draft because the questions and answers were not supplied at the end. The  review is welcome, and we wish Mr Daniell well. In the terms of reference, the  word &ldquo;adequate&rdquo; is used in relation to criminal and civil cases. I want to  ensure that we have safeguards, because there is a difference between adequate  representation and best representation. What steps will the Minister take to  ensure that adequate is not seen as the lowest common denominator?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I thank the Deputy Chairperson; he makes a fair point about the  difference between adequate and best representation. I suspect that the problem  is that, given the financial circumstances in which we live, we simply cannot  afford to say that everybody will get the best possible representation.  However, as far as I am concerned, the word &ldquo;adequate&rdquo; must mean more than the  bare minimum. Representation must be adequate to ensure a fair trial in  criminal cases and a fair exploration of the issues in civil cases. That will  be easier to explain when we look at the detail rather than in two or three  words in the terms of reference of a review.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>: I  welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement, which says</p>
<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I want to build a system of justice in Northern Ireland  that will meet the needs of everyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">In light of the Minister&rsquo;s statement on access to  justice, he will be aware of my correspondence about a constituent of mine who  is having difficulties with that issue. Will the Minister agree to meet with me  and my constituent as a matter of urgency to find a swift resolution to the  problems that he has experienced?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I cannot give such a commitment to any Member in the House. There  are aspects of the justice system for which I bear responsibility and on which  I am prepared to meet Members. Other aspects fall to the independence of  agencies such as the police, the Public Prosecution Service or the judiciary. I  am not in a position to promise ministerial interference in any of those areas.  I oppose that in any circumstances.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I declare an interest as a member of the Bar. I thank the Minister for his  statement, and I welcome the review. However, I want to question why Mr Daniell  has been appointed to carry out the review given that he was chairperson of the  Legal Services Commission. I do not have any objection to the man personally,  and I am not suggesting that there were any demerits in his conduct as  chairperson of that commission, but he was in charge of a system when the  build-up of legal aid expenditure happened.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I question whether he is the most appropriate person to be  put in charge of a review of the system that he operated. Although I wish Mr  Daniell and the Minister well in the review, I have a question mark against  whether Mr Daniell is the most suitable person in the circumstances. Would it  not be better to have someone coming from outside to give a more radical  approach to reviewing the present system?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I thank Mr Maginness for his further positive comments. He asked  whether someone from outside might be in a position to carry out a more radical  review. Of course, it might also be argued that Mr Daniell&rsquo;s recent experience  chairing the Legal Services Commission has given him the inside track that  would also allow him to be radical. In his work on the criminal justice review,  he clearly indicated his ability to carry out that level of a review, looking  at some fairly fundamental issues, in a detailed and positive way. That has led  to the system of government under which justice has been devolved.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">It is never an easy decision to determine how to appoint  someone to such a post. I viewed the appointment as a matter of urgency, which  precluded any question of public advertisement. On that basis, Mr Daniell has  shown the expertise that is required for the review, and I believe that he will  do a very good job in carrying it out.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  also welcome the statement and the potential for some innovation in policy in  the Assembly. Will the Minister confirm that he would wish to carry out the  review in any set of circumstances, notwithstanding the current financial situation?  Indeed, will he confirm that, rather than being about the system itself, the  review is about making the system work better for the individual citizen in Northern Ireland?  Will he confirm that any conclusions from the review will have to ensure that they  are consistent with equality and human rights legislation, both within the  jurisdiction &mdash;</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I must intervene, because I have said previously that we want  questions to the Minister&rsquo;s statement, not statements from Members. I will  stick rigidly to that, so I ask the Member to come to a question. The same  applies to all Members: we want questions to the Minister.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  asked a question, and I am finished.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I am not sure how to respond to your intervention, Mr Deputy  Speaker. I think that I identified four questions, and you do not seem to have  identified one yet.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The fundamental question with which my colleague started  was: did we want to carry out the review anyway, and the answer is yes. As I  said during the statement and in one answer, the issue is not about cost  cutting. It is about ensuring better access to justice. To digress; in my  professional career as a social worker, I saw many cases in which issues about  access to justice were not particularly well solved by legal aid being  available solely for adversarial court proceedings. The real issue is how to  ensure that every citizen gets proper legal aid and proper advice in ways that  assist in resolving problems, not in ways that sometimes create complications.  Clearly, there are cases that will have to go to court, and there are other  cases where alternative methods and better application of the funding that is  available for legal aid might produce some benefits for individual citizens.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">On the final point on which you cut off Dr Farry, it is  clear that anything that will flow from the review will have to satisfy fully  the equality and human rights legislation under which every part of these  institutions works.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  I also welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement and the review that is to be conducted  by Mr Jim Daniell. Many people in Northern Ireland are concerned  about the pace of the judicial process and the delays in several areas. Will  the review, which is to examine a number of areas, examine an area that is of  concern to many people? I refer to the seemingly long delays by barristers and  other legal professionals for what appears, to many people, to be to their  benefit when their clients are in receipt of legal aid.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I thank Mr Buchanan for that question. Dealing with delays in the  legal process is not specifically an issue for the review, but, undoubtedly,  many people are concerned by delays that may be financially advantageous to  members of the legal profession. Never mind this fundamental review, through  some of the reforms that are currently being made in the way that legal aid is  paid, there are decreasing benefits for those who would seek adjournments in  the way that might have been perceived a few years ago as being potentially  financially beneficial.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">That is part of the other key proposal that I have put  forward in my time as Minister: to speed up justice. It is absolutely clear  that justice in this region is significantly slower than it ought to be. We  need to ensure that every part of the justice system works together to improve  the service that our citizens receive.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">1.45 pm</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The points that I wished to raise  have been covered.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. He said that he is grateful to both the  Bar Council and the Law Society for their degree of engagement in developing  home-grown proposals. Does the Minister accept that many of the rules of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s expensive legal aid system,  which is three times more expensive than Scotland&rsquo;s  and twice as expensive as that in England  and Wales,  were home-grown? Will the Minister ensure that Mr Daniell conducts a clear  trawl of the rules and regulations in the rest of the United Kingdom  when he carries out his review?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I thank Mr Spratt for that general point. However, I am not sure  that, having set up an independent review, I should now engage in telling the  reviewer what he should do. I have absolutely no doubt that Mr Daniell will  look at those issues. Indeed, the kind of concerns that Mr Spratt raised are  being addressed already. Mr Spratt referred to the issue of what is home-grown  and what is not. Work is ongoing to look at the current operation of the legal  aid system, and I hope to take that to the Committee for Justice and the  Executive shortly. Part of that work aims to ensure that we make cuts in a way  that ensures that expenditure is best used for the benefit of our people. That  is part of what I described as a home-grown solution. Most of the current  system effectively follows the England  and Wales  processes, although some of the ways in which it is carried out have turned out  to be more expensive here.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am grateful to the Minister for his statement and for what I perceive to be  his assurance that he will ensure that he will be a driving force in ensuring  meaningful reform, particularly in light of the current economic climate. How  optimistic is the Minister about the timescales that he indicated?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I remain ever the optimist; otherwise, I do not think that I would  have taken on this post five months ago. Of course, the issue is not just the  timescales in which the review is carried out but the timescales for the  implementation of that review. That is where our people will start to see the  benefit, and that may well require primary legislation. If that was an offer  from Mr Kennedy of his and his colleagues&rsquo; assistance in ensuring that the  legislation that flows from the review goes through the House speedily, I  accept it gratefully.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s acknowledge&shy;ment of a clear link between access to  justice and social policy. Will the Minister inform the House why there was not  a point in the terms of reference that requires Mr Daniell to look specifically  at those direct links and consider issues under the purview of the Department  for Social Development, perhaps, as well as under that of the Department of  Justice?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: Mr McDevitt makes a reasonable point. However, I am not sure that  I could have included every conceivable item of social policy across a range of  other Departments. He highlighted the Department for Social Development, but  there might be concern if we were to start to stray into other Ministers&rsquo;  territory. There may be implications for a number of Departments besides the  Department for Social Development. Mr Daniell has been given fairly  wide-ranging terms of reference. If policy issues that flow from the review  affect other Departments, it will fall to me to discuss that with the relevant  Ministers.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: In  respect of legal aid expenditure, does the Minister share the public&rsquo;s concern  about one barrister&rsquo;s receipt of &pound;1&middot;4 million of public money in one year at a  time when the jobs of teachers, doctors and nurses were under pressure? Will he  assure us that the excessive gravy train will not continue into the future?  Given the accountability procedures that we now have as a result of the  devolution of policing and justice powers to the House, is it right that the  identity of someone who took &pound;1&middot;4 million of public money should remain a  secret? To the best of my knowledge, that person&rsquo;s identity has remained a  secret.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I will take up Mr Bell&rsquo;s final point. I gather that the issue of  the anonymity of barristers who received legal aid payments is still under  discussion, and I hope that it will be resolved in a way that will give greater  public satisfaction.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The issue of the total amount that is paid to any  individual relates to whether they have satisfied the necessary rules to show  that they have produced the necessary work which justifies those payments. All  that I can say is that that particular payment was made before I became  Minister, and it is not a payment for which I bear any responsibility. However,  it is absolutely clear, as Members will see when we look at the current  proposals for the immediate reduction in legal aid costs, that it is unlikely  that the same level of funding will still be around for the same number of very  high-cost cases, which is where some of those issues have come up. In  particular, we will have a much more transparent system, which will ensure that  payments are much more easily justifiable on both sides of the argument.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I also welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement and include in that the efforts that he  has made to get us this far. Is there research establishing the percentage of  cases where, without legal aid, a victim pursues a non-molestation order by  independent means? Even without such facts, will the Minister give a commitment  that the review can assure that the most vulnerable will not be denied access  to justice due to financial considerations?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I thank Mr McNarry for his positive comments. The specific issue  of non-molestation orders causes me a degree of concern at the moment. Although  I am not in a position to make a formal announcement, I can say that the issue  of how funding is being given for non-molestation orders and other particular  difficulties arising out of issues such as domestic abuse is under  consideration as a discrete issue, separate from any other concerns about legal  aid, because I believe that it is something on which the House would wish me to  respond speedily.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement and welcome the review. The Minister  mentioned that the voluntary sector has an important contribution to make to  the review. Will the Minister look at enhancing the voluntary sector and  organisations such as the Law Centre and Citizens Advice in their taking on an  intermediary role to resolve disputes instead of those going straight to court?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: Yet again, my colleague, in her charming way, is encouraging me to  go further than I should do having set up the review. I will merely say that I  am seeking to see engagement in the review, not just from the obvious bodies in  the legal profession and related bodies but on the widest possible scale, so  that Mr Daniell has a well-informed view of public opinion. I believe that if  we are going to look at alternative methods of resolving disputes, one of the  issues that will have to be considered is which particular organisations are  best placed to do that. However, I fear that if I do anything further I will  tread on Mr Daniell&rsquo;s toes.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lyttle</strong>: I  also welcome the review and the fact that the Minister has made improving  access to justice a central aim of his Department. Is the Minister confident  that the review will result in tailored and specific recommendations for this  region?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  That is a new plant.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: Mr Kennedy is well aware that I do not get plants from my  colleagues. Normally, I get only difficult questions from them.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">From a brief, informal discussion that I had with Mr  Daniell, in which I outlined the terms of reference to him, I am satisfied that  he will ensure that there is innovative and radical thinking which puts the  needs of Northern Ireland at the key. The key question for the Assembly  subsequent to that &mdash; I have my party&rsquo;s support as well as that of Mr Kennedy&rsquo;s  on this matter &mdash; is to ensure that any radical and innovative thinking that  comes from the review will be carried as speedily as possible through the  House.</p>
<p class="H4StageHeading" style="page-break-before:always;"><a name="a8" id="a8"></a>Intergovernmental  Agreement in Criminal Justice Co-operation</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I have received notice from the Minister of Justice that he wishes  to make a further statement.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice (Mr Ford)</strong>: With your permission, Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish to make a  statement about a ministerial meeting that I had with Dermot Ahern TD under the  auspices of the intergovernmental agreement on co-operation on criminal justice  matters, in Carlingford on Friday 9 July. Although I met Mr Ahern during my  first week in office, our meeting on 9 July was the first formal ministerial  meeting under the inter&shy;governmental agreement since devolution of policing and  justice matters on 12 April.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Devolution of policing and justice powers provides an  opportunity to further enhance working relationships between and across  criminal justice agencies on both sides of the border in seeking to make both  jurisdictions better and safer places for people to live in, free from crime and  from the fear of crime.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Criminals work across borders. The only recognition that  they give to them is as an opportunity to make more money from illegal  activities. Therein lies the imperative that we who are tasked with tackling  such criminality also work across borders. I am determined to make the most of  opportunities, be they North/South, east/west or beyond these islands, to work  together where that makes sense, to benchmark our work against best practice  and to share on the international stage exemplars of work in the justice  system, as we have been able to do with youth conferencing recently.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">By way of background, the intergovernmental agreement is an  agreement between the UK  and Irish Governments and provides a framework for co-operation on criminal  justice matters. The agreement, which existed prior to April 2010, has been  adjusted to reflect the devolution of justice powers to the Assembly. It  supports at least one meeting each year between the justice Ministers North and  South, as well as a working group of officials from both jurisdictions that  meets at least twice each year. The working group is supported by ad hoc  project advisory groups, of which there are currently six, that are tasked with  criminal-justice-related work strands that are of mutual interest North and  South.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The intergovernmental agreement is not intended to provide  for discussion of cross-border security issues. However, I have cause to  discuss such matters regularly with Mr Ahern. I used the opportunity of our  being together on 9 July to discuss those other important issues. The meeting  provided a constructive opportunity to discuss many criminal justice issues of  mutual interest under the auspices of the intergovernmental agreement.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Mr Ahern and I discussed a range of cross-border issues,  including supporting public protection, management of sex offenders, support  for victims of crime, youth justice, forensic science and promoting social  diversity. We also received an update from officials on the project advisory  groups that cover those areas. In particular, we noted the good channels of  communication that exist between criminal justice organisations on both sides  of the border to ensure that criminals do not use the border to escape justice.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">A future work programme prepared by the working group under  the terms of the intergovernmental agreement was also agreed. It sets out a  number of priority areas for action by summer 2011. I have placed a copy of  that report in the Library. Planned actions to promote co-operation include  work to agree a shared approach to implementing two EU framework decisions on  the transfer of prisoners and probation supervision; reviewing processes for  returning sex offenders to their home jurisdictions; assessing the  responsiveness to victims of criminal justice agencies on both sides of the  border; development of a memorandum of understanding between forensic science  laboratories in each jurisdiction to provide mutual support in the event of  sudden loss or damage to facilities; reviewing approaches for dealing with  priority young offenders; and promoting social diversity, with focus on scoping  and identifying examples of best practice in tackling hate crime.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Progress against the work programme will be monitored by  the working group, which will report to Dermot Ahern and me at our next  meeting, which is planned for November. With the Speaker&rsquo;s agreement, it is my  intention to update the Chamber following that meeting and also after future  ministerial meetings that are held under the auspices of the intergovernmental  agreement.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Finally, I also took the opportunity when I met Dermot  Ahern to discuss an issue that is not in the intergovernmental agreement. We  agreed in principle to hold a trilateral meeting with Kenny MacAskill, the  Scottish Cabinet Secretary for Justice, to enable discussion on matters of  common interest across the three jurisdictions. I hope that such a meeting can  be arranged soon.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Justice (Lord Morrow)</strong>: I thank the Minister for his  statement to the House and for the promptness with which he made it available.  I hope that he continues that practice throughout his tenure as Minister of  Justice.<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
<p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I note from the Minister&rsquo;s statement that he intends to  make the most of opportunities to enhance working relationships. When does he  intend to hold similar individual meetings with his relevant Scottish, English  and Welsh counterparts? Will he make oral statements to the Assembly on the  outcomes of those meetings? Did the Minister take the opportunity provided by  the meeting of 9 July to discuss the heinous crime of human trafficking? Has  any consideration been given to whether legislative change is necessary in  either or both jurisdictions to enhance co-operation, to ensure robust and  speedy action and to ensure that prosecutions take place and that there is no  hiding place?</p>
<p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Speaker in the Chair)</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I will now ask a question not as Chairperson of the Justice  Committee but in my capacity as a Member who represents the border constituency  of Fermanagh and South Tyrone. Was the dissident threat discussed in any way at  that meeting? In his statement, the Minister said:</p>
<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Criminals work across borders, and the only  recognition they give to them is as opportunities to make more money from  illegal activities.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I hope that the Minister will be able to answer in the  affirmative. I look forward to hearing his response, because he is acutely  aware of the threat that exists and the mayhem that dissident republicans have  caused in recent months. I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s views on the  matter.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I thank Lord Morrow for what were, again, complimentary remarks.  He raised the issue of the nature of the reporting of the meeting of 9 July and  asked about meetings with other Ministers. The position, as I chose to  interpret it, is that the intergovernmental agreement (IGA) is not the  North/South Ministerial Council but is, in many senses, analogous to that. I,  therefore, believed it appropriate to seek permission to make a statement on a  formal meeting under the intergovernmental agreement.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I do not view meetings with other Ministers in quite the  same way, as they do not fall under the same formal procedure. My first  informal meeting with Dermot Ahern took place outside of any formal procedures.  However, in answer to the question, I had a meeting in the early part of the  summer with Mr Kenny MacAskill, the Scottish Cabinet Secretary for Justice,  and, last week, I met the Home Secretary and the Lord Chancellor/Secretary of  State for Justice in Whitehall, who, in some  respects, are English Ministers and UK Ministers. At the moment,  justice matters have not been devolved to Wales, so I have not had any  meetings with any relevant Welsh Minister.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We did not have detailed discussion on a number of issues  at the meeting, but some issues, of which human trafficking is one, are  becoming more significant, in the same way as, for instance, smuggling is.  Smuggling is an issue that some of our working groups are taking forward. I  imagine that we will be having a more detailed discussion on trafficking in  November.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">As I said in my statement, although the IGA was not set up  to deal with terrorism-related matters specifically, it would be inconceivable  for the Justice Ministers, North and South, not to discuss at any such meeting,  formal or informal, the threat that is being faced in cross-border areas and  elsewhere. We discussed those issues, and those discussions centred very much  on co-operation between the PSNI and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in dealing with that  threat.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as a  r&aacute;iteas. I thank the Minister for his statement and welcome its timeliness. I  have one question on the protocols around the agreement. Given the fact that  the powers have been transferred, is the Minister satisfied that the protocols  are in place to allow co-operation to continue without hindrance or gaps?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I thank Mr McCartney for his question. I met Dermot Ahern on, I  think, my fourth day in office; it was certainly in my first week in office.  The meeting was held in Castle Buildings. I was accompanied by the Chief  Constable and the deputy chief constable, and Mr Ahern was accompanied by the  Garda Commissioner and the deputy commissioner. There was a sizeable delegation  from the two Departments on either side, and it was made absolutely clear to me  at that meeting, and has been on a number of occasions since, that all the  necessary protocols are in place to ensure the fullest possible co-operation in  all North/South matters, particularly those led by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the  PSNI, but also in relationships between other agencies. I believe that, at  present, we have significant and full cross-border co-operation that serves us  and those on the other side of the border extremely well.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I declare an interest as a member of the Bar.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister for his statement. It is obvious that  some very good work is going on in relation to the intergovernmental agreement  and co-operation on criminal justice. It makes good sense to co-operate North  and South. However, as the Chairperson of the Justice Committee said, it is  important that co-operation take place on a number of issues, but, in  particular, on human trafficking, which is a criminal activity that affects  both sides of the border. I hope that that co-operation can be deepened.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Further to that, in relation to forensic science, which the  Minister mentioned in his statement, there should be &mdash;</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member must come to his question.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  There should be greater co-operation and pooling of resources, particularly in  relation to forensic science, which is capital intensive and requires great  expertise. Will the Minister reassure the House that that co-operation will be  deepened?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: The Member highlights human trafficking, which is an issue that  causes significant concern to all of us. The most recent episode of  trafficking, as I understand it, was largely between Northern   Ireland and Scotland,  with some possible implications for England. However, there is full  co-operation between the PSNI, the UK Border Agency and the Garda National  Immigration Bureau in dealing with cross-border trafficking issues. That should  provide a measure of reassurance to Members in that respect.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  welcome the statement and invite the Minister to confirm that his attitude and  approach is that he will seek to represent the interests of Northern Ireland with all our neighbouring  jurisdictions and, indeed, Europe,  irrespective of any particular institutional format, whether through the  intergovernmental agreement or the North/South Ministerial Council? It is the  nature of the interaction that matters, not the precise structures.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I am aware that there are Members who believe that it would be  better if justice fell under the aegis of the NSMC. As far as I am concerned, I  am seeking to promote the widest possible co-operation between the agencies in  Northern Ireland and those of our neighbours, whichever jurisdiction they fall  within, and, indeed, at times, those agencies beyond these islands. If the  Executive choose to recommend to the Assembly different formats in which I  should operate, I will be prepared to carry out the Assembly&rsquo;s wishes in so  doing. However, it is vital to ensure that we have the maximum possible  co-operation among all the agencies that deal with organised crime, such as  trafficking or smuggling or a range of other offences, and which also work  together to defeat the terrorist threat, which is a threat to every part of  these islands at the same time. If that is the case, the issue of the precise  institutional structures is far less important than maximising co-operation.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>:  Will the Minister tell us whether environmental crime was raised at the  ministerial meeting? It is obvious that, in the past, Northern Ireland was used as a dumping ground  for criminals in the Republic   of Ireland, which cost  taxpayers tens of millions of pounds. Where is dealing with the Republic of Ireland Government on the scale of  priorities, particularly around the fuel laundering industry that is prevalent  in the border areas?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: Those are, in fact, slightly different issues. As the Member says,  fuel laundering is prevalent in the border areas, but if that is the case, it  is a Northern Ireland  issue. My Department does not take the lead on the issue of illegal dumping;  the Department of the Environment takes the lead, as the Member may remember  from his previous life. Environment Agency staff, for example, play a role in  the Organised Crime Task Force in dealing with matters such as illegal dumping.  That is an example of what I have been talking about; practical co-operation  rather than particular concerns about institutional structures.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: I  welcome the statement and the positive work that is entailed in it. On the  intergovernmental agreement in relation to the dissident threat, did the  Minister take the opportunity to thank his counterpart for the positive work  that the guards have undertaken in stopping terrorism from being exported into  this part of the United    Kingdom? Secondly, should we move from using  the term &ldquo;sexual trafficking&rdquo;, which is a very sanitised term for what, in  effect, is sexual slavery? Will that be on the agenda for the tripartite  meeting with Scotland, given the Minister&rsquo;s earlier comments and concerns about  Scotland being used as a transit base for human beings for the purposes of  sexual slavery?</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Finally, in relation to sex offender management, is the  Minister satisfied that the current procedures are robust enough, given the  high levels of recidivism of sex offenders, particularly paedophiles who offend  against children? Are the procedures &mdash;</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I encourage the Member to finish.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: I  will close on this sentence, Mr Speaker. Are the procedures sufficiently robust  to prevent children being abused in the future?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I fear that Mr Bell did not listen to the Deputy Speaker&rsquo;s  injunction about the number of questions, but I will try to be generous. The  first question was did I take the opportunity to thank Dermot Ahern for the  role of the garda&iacute; in stopping what the Member described as the export of  terrorism? I do not need a formal meeting to thank Dermot when I see good work  being done by the garda&iacute;, and indeed I have had informal conversations face to  face and by phone that have covered those kinds of issues.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, I think that I have used the term &ldquo;slavery&rdquo; in  speeches, although I do not know that we could use that term to name the  offence. However, it is absolutely slavery in any meaningful sense. The Member  referred to Scotland being used for the latest episode of trafficking, whereas,  actually, Scotland and Northern Ireland were both being used, so let us not  suggest that we are pointing the figure at the Scots and blaming them for what  was going on &mdash; although I do not think he was doing that. Unfortunately, there  are people in this society who are prepared to pay for the sex trade in a way  that puts young women, older women and young men at serious risk. That applies  in Northern Ireland, the  Republic, Scotland, England and Wales, and therefore we need to  ensure that we have the most joined-up approach possible to deal with it.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Member also asked me about robust procedures for  ensuring that sex offenders cannot reoffend. I think if he thought back to his  previous professional life he would find it difficult to justify how we could  ever say that those things would not happen. What I can say is that I believe  that we have robust procedures. In the context of my statement about the  intergovernmental agreement, I think we have procedures that are as robust on a  cross-border basis as those that exist within each of the two jurisdictions  separately. I am certainly keen to do all we can to enhance that robustness.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: In  relation to human trafficking, I would like to make a further point and then  ask the Minister for a further reply. Human trafficking is a growing problem in  the North and South of Ireland, but often Northern Ireland, particularly  Belfast, is being used as a transit route to traffic people from Dublin to the  rest of the UK, or vice versa. We have now seen three UK-wide operations by the  police to tackle human trafficking. Surely there should be some kind of  North/South united campaign or operation to crack human trafficking here.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: It is noticeable that a number of questions this morning have  dealt with the issue of trafficking. It shows the concern about it that exists  in the Assembly. There is no doubt, certainly judging by some of the  information I have seen on the most recent case, that people have been  trafficked into Northern Ireland, used as sex slaves &mdash; in Mr Bell&rsquo;s terminology  &mdash; within Northern Ireland, then trafficked out to other regions of these  islands. There is undoubtedly an extreme example of organised crime, which is  causing massive human misery. So, yes, my colleague is absolutely right. We  must ensure that we have the most active possible intervention to stop that  happening.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Those who use the sex trade should recognise the reality of  what they do, and those who have concerns about what is happening in whichever  jurisdiction should inform the relevant authorities, because, without proper  information, the police cannot take action. It is clear that a strong working  partnership exists. The institutions, especially the different police services,  recognise fully the concerns that exist and the depths of that crime. However,  public support is required to act against it to the fullest possible extent.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lyttle</strong>: I  join my colleagues in welcoming the Minister&rsquo;s statement, which shows extensive  co-operation in dealing with some international issues. On that note, the  statement refers to exemplars of youth conferencing in the justice system. Will  the Minister share further information about the nature of that system?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I thank my new colleague for that question. I have heard of  Members being congratulated on their maiden speech, but for a Member to score a  hat-trick of questions on his first day in the place is novel. I am probably  mixing metaphors; the Member scored a goal against the media last week.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">On the substance of his question, Members will know that a  group of people with responsibility for youth justice in England and Wales  came to Northern Ireland  recently to examine our youth conferencing process, because they are keen to  implement something similar. That is the measure of what one of our justice  agencies is doing. The process is an exemplar of good practice on a world  scale. It has achieved significant progress in the operation of youth  conferencing since it was introduced in Northern Ireland, and it shows the  way to other parts of these islands and further afield.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">When talking about cross-border co-operation and  co-operation with other regions, we in Northern Ireland should not be shy  about pointing out that we are ahead of the field in certain respects, because,  unfortunately, others are keen to point out, on occasion, that we are behind  the field in others.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I congratulate my colleagues in the Youth Justice Agency,  in particular the recently retired chief executive, Bill Lockhart. He ensured  that young people in difficulty have an excellent service that makes a major  contribution to providing a safer society for all citizens.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  As Question Time begins at 2.30 pm, I suggest that the House take its ease  until that time. After Question Time, the Finance Minister will make a  statement.<span style="font-family:'ITC Franklin Gothic Demi'; "> </span></p>

<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. I remind new Members and, perhaps, other Members that it is important to  rise in your place continually if you want to ask a supplementary question. The  key word is &ldquo;continually&rdquo;, because some Members rise once and feel that that  should be enough, which tells us at the Table that their question has already  been answered. Therefore, Members should continually rise in their place if  they want to ask a supplementary question.</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Maze/Long Kesh Site</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-Question">1. <strong>Mrs M  Bradley </strong>asked the First Minister and deputy First Minister to outline the  decisions and actions taken since June 2010 in relation to the development of  the Maze/Long Kesh site. (AQO 1525/11<a name="AQO1525/11" id="AQO1525/11"></a>)</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-Question">7. <strong>Mr  McCartney </strong>asked the First Minister and deputy First Minister to outline the  main elements of the plan for the Maze/Long Kesh site following the recent  announcement on an agreed way forward on its development. (AQO 1531/11<a name="AQO1531/11" id="AQO1531/11"></a>)</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister (Mr M McGuinness)</strong>: With your permission, Mr Speaker, I will answer  questions 1 and 7 together.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">On 29 July, the First Minister and I announced our  intention to table a motion in the Assembly to debate the draft statutory rule  to establish the Maze/Long Kesh development corporation. I can confirm that the  Assembly debate on that issue has been scheduled for tomorrow, Tuesday 14  September. If the Assembly approves the motion, it is intended that the  corporation will be operational from 1 April 2011, subject to all the necessary  approvals and a chairperson and members of the corporation being in place by  that time.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Maze/Long Kesh programme delivery unit continues to  prepare the site for future redevelopment so that there is no loss of momentum  in preparing for the development corporation. That work involves continuing  with the development of a master planning framework for the regeneration of the  site, interim business plans, which are necessary to support the development  corporation&rsquo;s proposed future initiatives on the site, and the completion of a  major programme of decontamination.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I am delighted to report that the business case for the  establishment of the development corporation has been approved by the  Department of Finance and Personnel. The initial phase of the redevelopment  plan will be the master planning framework. That will include a draft  implementation strategy and spatial development framework, along with outline  plans for essential infrastructure provision.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Over the coming months, our Department will submit an EU  funding application to secure funding for a peace building and conflict  resolution centre on the site. In-depth discussions are also continuing with  the Royal Ulster Agricultural Society (RUAS) about its potential relocation to  the Maze/Long Kesh site.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">In the current economic climate, a phased regeneration plan  will be implemented by the development corporation to spread the cost of the  development of the substantial 347-acre site and help to attract the private  investment that will be needed. That will also help to create early progress at  the site. It will, of course, be essential for us to secure budget provision to  cover public sector development costs, and the appropriate financial bids have  been made.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Maze/Long Kesh presents us with a unique opportunity. The  site is a key regional-level asset, and its regeneration can be a catalyst for  economic development and contribute to the social good. We should not miss this  opportunity.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his reply. What is the time frame for the submission  of the business case and the application form to the European funding  programme? How will the commission be selected?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: That will happen over the next while. All that work is ongoing,  and some work has been done on the European application. Europe  is waiting for us, and, now that we have put the wheels in motion, it is our  responsibility to ensure that we act as quickly as possible. I can guarantee  that that will be the case.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The vast majority of Members will be pleased that, after  quite a long delay, there is finally movement on the site, particularly given  that the economic regeneration of the area will be critical not only for those  who will eventually work there but for the construction industry, which is  anxious to get on site.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We have had positive developments on the prospect of  European money. The RUAS is anxious to move, and I spoke to representatives of  that organisation at the Balmoral Show. I have also heard that the private  sector has made declarations of interest. People appreciate the fact that  Maze/Long Kesh is a key site, and it is important that we move forward as  quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We are proceeding with all haste to put together the  development corporation. If tomorrow&rsquo;s motion to establish the development  corporation is approved by the Assembly and the Maze/Long Kesh business case is  approved by the Department of Finance and Personnel, the corporation will be in  operation on 1 April next year.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire. The Office of the First Minister and deputy  First Minister is committed to maximising the economic, historic and  reconciliation potential of the site. Can the deputy First Minister outline  what he envisages for the listed and retained buildings? In particular, what of  the peace building and conflict resolution centre?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The peace building and conflict resolution centre will be a  unique facility promoting international exchange. It will be a hub from which  to share with other nations our experience in many areas, including the  achievement of political agreement, policing, government and community  expertise. The centre will also provide conferencing facilities; house  research, study and academic activities; develop a modern archiving facility;  be a place for reflection; and provide a shared space for visitor access,  performance events and exhibitions.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Many people understand the importance of the construction  of such a centre. There is worldwide interest in it. The European Union has  shown itself to be anxiously awaiting it. We have seen over the summer that  there are still those in our society who believe that conflict and violence are  the best way forward. Our message to all of them is that that is not the case  and that the best way forward is through the democratic process. The conflict  junkies who are out there, some in small unrepresentative organisations which  believe that that is the best way forward and others within the political  process who believe it, will all get a very profound message as this iconic  project moves forward.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>: I  welcome the response from the First and deputy First Minister on the issue.  Does the deputy First Minister agree that this is an opportunity to drive  forward to the future and create jobs, rather than look back to the past? I  recognise that the site was an important military site, used by the British  Army in the Second World War, and that the Ulster Aviation Society currently  uses the facility. Will that continue to be the case after the Order is passed?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: A lot has been written in the media, many statements issued and  suggestions made as to what this will be. I want it to be a shrine to peace and  the future. The development corporation will obviously have the responsibility  for it. It will be charged with the duty to take forward this work and ensure  that whatever is presented on the site is inclusive of everyone who has  participated on it. The Member has mentioned a number of organisations: I have  no doubt that those charged with taking this forward will do so because they  understand that, two or three years ago, there was an absolute consensus among  all the parties in the Assembly that, when the project came to fruition, it had  to be totally inclusive.</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Public Assemblies, Parades and Protests  Bill</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-Question">2. <strong>Mr  O&rsquo;Loan </strong>asked the First Minister and deputy First Minister to outline their  proposed amendments to the draft Public Assemblies, Parades and Protests Bill.  (AQO 1526/11<a name="AQO1526/11" id="AQO1526/11"></a>)</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The junior Minister, Mr Gerry Kelly, will answer this question.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister) (Mr G Kelly)</strong>:  A number of amendments have been made to the draft Bill following the  conclusion of the public consultation on 14 July. The key change has been the  removal of all public meetings from the remit of the legislation, in direct  response to the concerns raised by a number of individuals, community groups,  trade unions and churches during the consultation period. We have considered the  views submitted during the consultation and have amended the Bill accordingly.  The new legislation will be fully consistent with international human rights  standards.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I give Members notice that questions 9 and 13 have been withdrawn.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  As the junior Minister said, the Human Rights Commission and the trade unions  expressed serious concerns about public meetings, legitimate demonstrations and  protest meetings. Have those bodies indicated that they are content with the  proposed amendments? There may still be serious problems with the legislation.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr G Kelly)</strong>: Those issues, among others, were discussed at an  early stage in the consultation and brought to our attention, and we acted on  them. Most if not all of the stakeholders will be satisfied with the amendments  we have made.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am grateful for the answers provided by the junior Minister. Even at this  late stage, to avoid the ongoing failure to consult widely enough outside the  closed doors of the leadership of Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP, will he, on behalf of  the Department, take steps to involve all parties in the decision-making  process for major proposals on parades legislation?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr G Kelly)</strong>: We took the consultation process, which lasted for  12 weeks and was open to everyone, into consideration. There were approximately  410 responses to the wide-ranging consultation. Also, many groups,  organisations and individuals spoke to the working group.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lyttle</strong>:  May I seek confirmation that one amendment includes the removal of the  requirement for 50 or more people to apply for the right to public assembly and  that that will apply to organisations such as the Association of Old Vehicle  Clubs in Northern Ireland?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr G Kelly)</strong>: Yes; I can give that guarantee.</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Public Expenditure</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-Question">3. <strong>Ms M Anderson </strong>asked the First Minister and deputy First  Minister how the Executive intend to deal with the current economic downturn  and public spending cuts as discussed at their recent away-day at Greenmount College. (AQO 1527/11<a name="AQO1527/11" id="AQO1527/11"></a>)</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The Executive have taken and will continue to take a proactive  and focused approach to economic issues. Since November 2008, the challenge of  addressing the impact of the economic downturn has been a standing agenda item  at Executive meetings.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">In December 2008, the Executive announced their first  consolidated package of measures to address the local impact of the economic  downturn and to promote a return to sustainable growth. That package is now  complete, and all 76 credit crunch actions and sub-actions therein have been  taken forward. The package was developed through discussions in the  cross-sector advisory forum with an extensive range of stakeholders from the business,  trade union, financial, consumer, voluntary and community sectors.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Against that background, the Executive&rsquo;s special meeting at  Greenmount College on 6 July 2010 allowed them  fully to consider the magnitude of the fiscal challenge that faces society and  the economy in the coming years. The meeting also gave the Executive a focused  opportunity to start taking the necessary steps to plan to address those  difficult issues. It is clear that hard decisions must be made by all of us  over the coming months and years.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Executive&rsquo;s objective is to focus on growing the  economy while protecting the most vulnerable citizens, especially those at risk  of poverty. We recognise that it is vital to ensure a collective and corporate  Executive approach to ensure the best possible outcome. To that end, we agreed  at Greenmount that a Budget review group, made up of a ministerial  representative of each of the parties on the Executive, should be established  to oversee the development of our response to the significant budgetary  pressures that we face. The Budget review group includes the First Minister,  me, the Minister of Finance and Personnel, the Minister for Employment and  Learning, the Minister for Regional Development and the Minister of Justice.  Papers have been commissioned for that group on a range of issues related to  the budgetary and economic situation across government, and its first meeting  will take place soon.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms M Anderson</strong>: Go raibh  m&iacute;le maith agat. Do the First Minister and deputy First Minister have any plans  to meet the British Prime Minister and Chancellor to raise the special  circumstances arising from the years of underinvestment in the North,  particularly in the north-west?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The First Minister and I will meet the Secretary of State Owen  Paterson later this week. We plan to raise those issues with him and with  George Osborne and David Cameron, before the publication of the spending review  in mid-October. We all face a serious fiscal situation, and many threatening  noises have come from the coalition Government in London. The best approach is the one on which  the First Minister and I agreed, which is to place the development of the  economy at the front and centre of the Programme for Government. We must  continue to do that and, as best we can, to protect front line services and the  interests of those who are most disadvantaged in society.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I am absolutely convinced that we will go to those meetings  with a very united approach. There has been a lot of hot air in the media over  the last short while. At the end of the day, however, the knuckling down has to  be done, and we are prepared to do that. We are prepared to speak to the powers  that be in London  and put what we think is a very strong case on behalf of the Executive and  Assembly.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Have the Executive identified any ways in which departmental spending could be  refocused to counter job cuts in the public sector and give relief to the  private sector?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: All those issues represent a real challenge to us. In recent  years, we have all heard many comments about the unbalanced nature of our  economy vis-&agrave;-vis the public sector and the private sector. All our  Departments, without exception, are focused on the challenges that lie ahead.  At the end of the day, they will have to come to the Executive, who are the  body who will take the decisions about what is the best way forward. Obviously,  however, there is still a considerable amount of work to be done in the  intervening period. The meetings with the Treasury and David Cameron that we  have sought will be absolutely crucial.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  Will the deputy First Minister give us some indication of when exactly the  revised Budget will be in front of us, along with a Programme for Government?  Will he give a bit more detail as to how we will protect the essential front  line services that are feeling very threatened at the moment?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: It would probably take me from now to midnight to comment on the  Member&rsquo;s second question. The main point for all of us is that we face a  situation in which a Programme for Government and Budget have to be agreed in  the coming period. Ideally, we aim to ensure that the draft Budget is in place  before Christmas. However, we cannot do any of that until such times as we see  the outcome of the comprehensive spending review, and we will hear an  announcement about that on 22 October 2010.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  Will the deputy First Minister tell us whether he still agrees that the economy  should be and should remain the centrepiece for the recovery, as was envisaged  originally in the Programme for Government way back in 2008, assuming, of  course, that his powers of memory recall are now back in place?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: I agree with the Member, which is a first. There is no doubt  whatsoever that, if we are to ensure that we keep our economy on track and get  people into work, the continuing development of our economy is absolutely  vital. That is alongside the protection of front line services and the most  disadvantaged in our society. Those represent real challenges, but the First  Minister and I still believe absolutely that the continuing development of our  economy should remain front and centre of any Programme for Government.</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Budget 2010-11</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-Question">4. <strong>Mr F  McCann </strong>asked the First Minister and deputy First Minister what steps the  Executive will take to safeguard disadvantaged people who have been adversely  impacted by the recent Budget. (AQO 1528/11<a name="AQO1528/11" id="AQO1528/11"></a>)</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The total amount of funding that is available to the Executive  will be confirmed only when the outcome of the 2010 UK spending review is announced on  20 October 2010. Currently, Departments are developing their spending plans to  be considered by the Executive, and they have been asked to complete impact assessments  so that equality and good relations impacts are considered at the same time as  their proposals. It will be for the Executive to decide their priorities for  the new spending review period, and only following public consultation on the  Programme for Government, Budget and investment strategy and Assembly  endorsement will final allocations be confirmed.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly will be aware that, following the Executive  awayday at Greenmount, the First Minister and I made it clear that one of our  priorities would be protecting our most vulnerable citizens, especially those  who are at risk of poverty. In our bids for the forthcoming CSR, we have sought  funding to target some of our most disadvantaged areas and for a pilot project  in relation to earnings disregard.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Given what the deputy First Minister just said about the pilot project to look  at the impact of an increase in the earnings disregard, how does that approach  fit in with the OFMDFM Committee&rsquo;s inquiry into child poverty?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: I believe that that approach fits perfectly with the important  work that is being carried out by the OFMDFM Committee. Members will recall  that the inquiry report recommended that:</p>
<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;making work pay should be a specific objective within  the Lifetime Opportunities Implementation Plan&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Furthermore, the Committee recommended that a pilot  scheme, Better Off in Work, should be developed. Given OFMDFM&rsquo;s lead role, we  are taking on that challenge by seeking to ensure that those who suffer most  from disadvantage have an opportunity to take up work without being made worse  off by the current inadequacies of the benefits system.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  The deputy First Minister may recall that the Institute for Fiscal Studies said  recently that the Budget cuts are aggressive and are hitting our poorest  families, which are losing 5% of their net income, while richer families are  losing only 1% of their net income. Given that and the fact that more than  340,000 people in Northern    Ireland live in relative income poverty,  what steps will OFMDFM take to adjust its antipoverty strategy to meet that  challenge?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: Obviously, we keep the matter under constant review. The  hardship, poverty, debt and energy subgroup was asked to identify the best  initiatives to relieve social and welfare hardships and inequalities arising  from the economic crisis, as well as those that would combat things such as  illegal moneylending. It was also asked to help local people to manage debt.  The subgroup was established on 23 July 2009, and it met for the second time on  15 October 2009. It is chaired jointly by the junior Ministers. The subgroup&rsquo;s  work is complete, and its recommendations were submitted to the First Minister  and me.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Some of the measures that could be implemented most readily  include further work to investigate illegal moneylending; providing off-site  facilities to help with benefit applications; providing a central point of  information on sources of support to address poverty; continuing to promote  benefit entitlement; encouraging banks to address the financial exclusion of  younger people; implementing new powers to allow registered social housing  landlords to broker energy at a discounted tariff; continuing to implement  programmes, such as the warm homes scheme, to insulate homes; and aligning  local credit union functions with those in England, Scotland, Wales and the  South.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  All work that our Departments are doing to tackle disadvantage is to be  commended. As we all know, disadvantage is growing. Does that ongoing work  include reprioritising the Budget and the Programme for Government, or is that  a non-starter?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: I think that all Members understand the significance of whatever  announcement is made in October. Until then, I think that it is best that we  move forward with the present Programme for Government and Budget, to which we  all agreed. However, we are clearly moving into a new situation, and, given the  obvious challenges that we will face, the Executive as a whole will have to  consider and even reconsider their approaches to the Programme for Government  and the Budget. Nevertheless, as I said, to bring people out of poverty and to  move forward, we would like to continue to invest in people and jobs, because  ensuring that we grow the economy is critical to all that.</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Sustainable Development Commission</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-Question">5. <strong>Dr  Farry </strong>asked the First Minister and deputy First Minister to outline their  response to the UK Government&rsquo;s decision to abolish the Sustainable Development  Commission. (AQO 1529/11<a name="AQO1529/11" id="AQO1529/11"></a>)</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The Sustainable Development Commission has provided the Executive  with valuable support on sustainable development. In the light of DEFRA&rsquo;s  decision to withdraw funding from the Sustainable Development Commission, we  are considering a number of options for the delivery of the functions that have  to date been supported and carried out by that body. Our Department continues  to work closely with all parties involved to explore and take advantage of  potential opportunities for co-operation. Decisions must be taken against the  background of the current spending pressures faced by all Departments. Every  effort will be made to identify the most effective means of delivering  sustainable development priorities and objectives now and in the future.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Executive are committed to the principles of  sustainable development and to progressing the priorities and strategic  objectives set out in our new sustainable development strategy. All 12 Departments  have brought forward comprehensive programmes of activity supporting the  strategic objective of the Executive, as have a range of bodies outside government.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  thank the deputy First Minister for his detailed answer. I understand that Northern Ireland, Scotland  and Wales  were not consulted about the arrangement. It is not right that we are dictated  to by what happens in London.  Will this Administration liaise with their counterparts in Scotland and Wales to see whether we can find  some combined solution to bring forward this important agenda, not least given  the importance of energy efficiency in the public sector and the wider  development of the green economy?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: We were first informed of Caroline Spelman&rsquo;s intention to  withdraw funding from the Sustainable Development Commission on 15 July 2010.  Since that announce&shy;ment, officials have met counterparts in other Administrations  on a number of occasions to discuss a range of policy and logistical matters,  and more meetings are scheduled.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Can the Sustainable Development  Commission continue to function in the North without continued DEFRA support?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: As we all know, the work of the commission has been subsidised by  DEFRA and the different devolved Administrations for some years. In that  context, it is important to give careful consideration to how we can continue  to deliver the functions previously carried out by the commission that have  shown themselves to be critical with respect to affecting our ability to meet  our objectives while maintaining value for money for the Executive. An added  factor is that this matter is being considered against the background of the  current spending pressures faced by all Departments.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Given the delay in the OFMDFM strategy for sustainable development, does the  Minister believe that the commission was of sufficient challenge to the  Department in the discharge of the Department&rsquo;s duties?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The success was that we came to an agreement. Agreement, however  long it takes, is always very important. Given that our 12 Departments have  come forward with their proposals, there is no doubt that they were  sufficiently challenged.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert  Coulter</strong>: I thank the Minister for his answers. What economic impacts are  likely to be felt in the green jobs sector by the change in Government priority  suggested by the abolition of the Sustainable Development Commission?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: That remains to be seen. As far as we are concerned, what will be  critical, against the backdrop of the withdrawal of funding for the commission  by the coalition Government, will be how our budgetary situation will allow us  to take whatever advantage we can from a very real challenge, not just for our  society and Government but for all Governments throughout the world, of  recognising the importance of having effective, sustainable development  strategies.</p>

<p class="OralAnswers-Question">6. <strong>Mr  Storey </strong>asked the First Minister and deputy First Minister for their  assessment of the parading season this year. (AQO 1530/11<a name="AQO1530/11" id="AQO1530/11"></a>)</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: Thankfully and to put the issue in perspective, almost all  parades passed off peacefully this year. Great credit must go to the  communities that enabled that to happen. However, it is obvious from events at  some of this year&rsquo;s parades that we still have some way to go for the parading  issue to be resolved.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Executive are fully committed to building a future  based on tolerance, equality and mutual respect. In line with that thinking,  earlier this year the First Minister and I initiated the review process that  will consider all issues associated with the management of parades, with the  aim of establishing a framework in which solutions to the parading issues are  found. The new legislation will introduce improved methods for future  management and decision making relevant to parades.</p>

<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Schools: Diabetes</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-Question">1. <strong>Mr Frew </strong>asked the Minister of Education what training is provided to teachers and  school staff to raise awareness and to enable them to care for children with  health conditions such as diabetes. (AQO 1539/11<a name="AQO1539/11" id="AQO1539/11"></a>)</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education (Ms Ruane)</strong>: Chuir pr&iacute;omhfheidhmeannaigh na mbord oideachais agus  leabharlann in i&uacute;l dom go nd&eacute;anann na boird anail&iacute;s riachtanas bhliant&uacute;il ar an  oili&uacute;int a bheidh de dh&iacute;th ar scoileanna sa bhliain acad&uacute;il at&aacute; le teacht.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I have been advised by the chief executives of the  education and library boards that boards undertake an annual needs analysis of  the training required by schools for the forthcoming academic year. School  principals are responsible for determining the training needs of their teachers  and school staff, and they can avail themselves of the wide range of courses on  all aspects of special education needs, including diabetes, offered by the  boards. Training on health conditions is provided by the relevant health and  social care trust. That training is in line with the pupil&rsquo;s individual  healthcare plan and is subject to an ongoing review.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">In addition, the Department of Education, with assistance  from the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, issued a  guidance document entitled &lsquo;Supporting Pupils with Medication Needs&rsquo; to all  schools in March 2008. On foot of that, the Department of Education provided  funding to the boards to train principals of all schools during the 2008-09  academic year so that they can meet the needs of all pupils with medical needs,  including those with diabetes. The guidance and training have provided  principals with sound protocols to enable them to meet the medication needs of  their pupils.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">In February 2010, the Department of Health, Social Services  and Public Safety, in partnership with the Department of Education, developed a  further document entitled &lsquo;Guidelines for Management of Anaphylaxis in  Educational Establishments.&rsquo; That augmented the information contained in  &lsquo;Supporting Pupils with Medication Needs&rsquo; by outlining the specific roles and  responsibilities of schools, school meal services, parents and carers, pupils  and school health teams.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Frew</strong>: I  thank the Minister of Education for her answer. Is she aware that the  documentation she spoke about is extremely vague, apart from the clear message  that responsibility lies firmly with the parents and schools and that teachers  are not obliged to help in any way? There are two issues here: the provision of  insulin at lunchtime in primary schools and the end of discrimination &mdash;</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member should come to his question.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Frew</strong>:  Does the Minister aim to improve care for children with diabetes and end  discrimination against diabetic pupils who face exclusion from school trips and  extra-curricular activities as a result of their condition?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: No child should face exclusion from school trips or any other  activity for the reasons the Member referred to. I will bring the Member&rsquo;s  comments to the attention of my officials and those in the Department of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety, which takes the lead in that area.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Given that there is a threat of &pound;235 million of teacher redundancies next year,  does the Minister think that teachers will be able to undertake any additional  responsibilities other than those required under statute?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: It is important that we prioritise resources for front line  services in these tough economic times, and I ask my colleagues to support me  when I fight to protect those services. Our disadvantaged and vulnerable young  people should not be the ones affected during difficult economic times, and it  is important that all the different parties, the community, voluntary and  business sectors and the trade union movement come together to form a united  front and fight for the best possible deal for this part of Ireland.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  Will the Minister tell the House how many school nurses are on site and whether  there has been any reduction in the number of school nurses in the past year?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I do not have that information to hand, but I am happy to  forward it to the Member.</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Schools: Building Budget</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-Question">2. <strong>Mr G  Robinson </strong>asked the Minister of Education why she did not spend her full  school building budget for the 2009-2010 financial year when many schools are  in need of a rebuild or urgent repair. (AQO 1540/11<a name="AQO1540/11" id="AQO1540/11"></a>)</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Sa bhliain 2009-2010 caitheadh 100% den bhuis&eacute;ad deiridh  caipitil de &pound;242 milli&uacute;n.

<p class="B3BodyText"><span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: In 2009-2010, 100% of the final capital budget of &pound;242 million  was spent. Fifteen new schools were opened, representing an investment of  &pound;135&middot;2 million. So far this year, my Department has opened eight new schools  and eight more are under construction, representing a further investment in the  schools estate of &pound;225&middot;5 million. Furthermore, I recently announced a further  school project worth &pound;13 million, which will commence on site this financial  year at an estimated value of a further &pound;65&middot;5 million.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Since taking up position as Minister of Education, I have  spent the capital resources that have been available to me. I have proven that,  if I get the funding that is needed, I can spend it. I will continue to lobby  for more capital funding to bring the schools estate to an acceptable level,  and I will continue to lobby for more resource funding to ensure that our  school buildings are properly maintained.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Basically, the message I have is: give me the money, and I  will build schools and continue to maintain them. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Therefore, I call on the Executive to prioritise front line  services across the Budget 2010 period to ensure that an appropriate level of  funding is provided in order to allow me to effect real change in the condition  of our schools estate and to improve the educational experience of all  children.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">My record contrasts starkly with that of direct rule  Ministers, who handed back &pound;62 million worth of funding in 2005-06 and &pound;91 million  in 2006-07. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: We spent 100% of our budget this year.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  Given that the Minister handed money back during the spending rounds, will she  explain why a school in my constituency is still waiting for a new fire alarm  system to be installed one year on? I am sure that the Minister will agree that  that is a vital health and safety issue in that school.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Obviously, I am not going to get into individual schools here.  However, I will certainly write to the Member about that school.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I want to work with everybody here on school building  programmes. Members will be aware that I did hand back some of my capital  budget when money was needed to address swine flu. Therefore, I worked with  another Minister so that we worked as a team. Thankfully, I then fought for  more money, got more resources, and we are going to be building 13 new schools  this year. That is despite everyone in this House telling me that I would not  be building any more new schools.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Why did some of the schools that were only partially compliant get the go-ahead  when some schools that were fully compliant did not get the go-ahead recently?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: As the Member is well aware, all the schools that got the  go-ahead complied with the standards that were set by our Department. The  Member will also be aware that that money was made available through in-year  monitoring rounds. I fought my corner to get more money, which has to be spent  this year. Therefore, all the projects that got the go-ahead, which included  projects from every sector for every community, were ready to go on site.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  What is the Minister&rsquo;s assessment of the conditions in which the children in St  Clare&rsquo;s Convent Primary School in Newry are being  taught? Will she explain why the school was passed over for investment in her  recent announcements?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: As I said, I am not going to get into individual schools here. I  will certainly write to the Member about St Clare&rsquo;s. I visited the school,  which is doing tremendous work, and the Member will be aware that there are  complications as to how that school can move forward. My officials have been  working with that school. The Member will also be aware of the fact that two  schools in his constituency did get the go-ahead for funding. It is a pity that  he did not acknowledge that. I hope that the Member will join the boards of  governors of those schools in celebrating that.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. As a former Chairperson of the Public  Accounts Committee, I am aware of the sensitivities around an Audit Office  report.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">There was much media speculation and comment about figures  in that report, namely those that referred to money that had been returned.  Will the Minister tell us why money was returned to the centre?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Ba mhaith liom a thabhairt le fios sa d&aacute; bhliain ioml&aacute;na ina  raibh mise mar Aire, ba &eacute; an gannchaiteachas i gcoinne staid an bhuis&eacute;id  deiridh n&aacute; &pound;2 milli&uacute;n as &pound;441 milli&uacute;n; is &eacute; sin n&iacute;os l&uacute; n&aacute; 0 5.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">In the two full years that I have been Minister, underspend  has been &pound;2 million against a final budget position of &pound;441 million. That is  less than 0&middot;5%. In the previous years under direct rule Ministers, the  following delays in progressing capital projects were entered in the financial  years that are profiled in the report: review of economic appraisals in line  with revised DFP requirements, namely that economic appraisals must be no older  than 24 months; revision of long-term enrolment figures requiring design work  to be undertaken; and initial spend projections were based on overly optimistic  profiles received from project managers and education and library boards. The  problem was exacerbated in 2006 when the capital announcement included a number  of projects that were still at economic appraisal or at very early planning  stage with no reasonable expectation of work beginning on site for a number of  years.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Department reviewed all its major capital projects in  planning to take account of the recommendations of the Bain review. The  Department lost a legal challenge to the major construction framework. That  delayed a number of projects, which had to revert to conventional procurement  methods. I am pleased to say that we have moved many of those projects on.  There was also delay in acquiring statutory planning approvals, and problems  were encountered with acquiring sites due to the unavailability of suitable  land and fluctuating land variations.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">If Members look at the data from the past number of years,  they will see that underspend changes from &pound;43 million in 2005-06 &mdash; that does  not include money that was handed back early in the year &mdash; to zero underspend  in 2009-2010. In 2008-09, it was &pound;2 million. The trend is that underspend is  going down. That has happened because of a large number of people&rsquo;s very good  work, and I congratulate them for that. However, we cannot be complacent,  because loads of schools need money to build, and there is a pattern of  underinvestment in our schools. Give me the money and I will build the schools.</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Education and Skills Authority</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-Question">3. <strong>Ms N&iacute;  Chuil&iacute;n </strong>asked the Minister of Education how much funding has been lost to  front line education services as a result of the failure to implement the  Executive&rsquo;s decision to establish the Education and Skills Authority. (AQO  1541/11<a name="AQO1541/11" id="AQO1541/11"></a>)</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: T&aacute; m&eacute; bu&iacute;och de mo chomhghleaca&iacute; as an &aacute;bhar seo a ard&uacute;. Beidh a  fhios ag Comhalta&iacute; gur glacadh leis an mBille Oideachais sa Ch&eacute;im Coiste  beagnach bliain &oacute; shin, ag deireadh mh&iacute; Mhe&aacute;n F&oacute;mhair sa bhliain 2009. &Oacute;n am  sin, n&iacute; raibh an Coiste Feidhmi&uacute;ch&aacute;in in ann an Bille a chur ar aghaidh chuig  an gC&eacute;im Bhreithnithe.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I am grateful to my colleague Caral N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n for raising  this important topic. Members will know that the Education Bill passed its  Committee Stage almost a year ago, at the end of September 2009. Since then,  the Executive have not been able to progress the Bill to Consideration Stage.  However, financial projections for 2010 onward had already been made in the  expectation of forthcoming savings from the establishment of the Education and  Skills Authority (ESA). For example, in the current year, &pound;13 million has been  removed from the baseline for my Department. Those figures were already known,  and the reductions have been taken from expenditure that ordinarily underpins  support services and other non-schools expenditure.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">To date, no impact on front line services has been  realised, although the continuing delay and the financial prospects for future  years will mean that the threat to front line services will rise the longer the  legislation is delayed. My Department has continued to work to progress  convergence of services across all education and library board areas until such  time as the legislation is enacted to establish the unitary authority. I trust  that that work will enable front line services to be protected from the further  reductions that will inevitably follow. We have to stop spending money  unnecessarily on administration and make sure that we get much-needed money  into the front line.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. Will the Minister confirm whether any issues need to be  resolved between her and the Protestant transferors?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: No. To the best of my knowledge, all the issues raised by the  transferors have been resolved to their satisfaction.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I remind Members to stand in their places continually if they wish to ask a  supplementary question.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  If the Minister believes it to be the case that ESA is not coming into  existence because the issues of the Protestant  Church representatives have been  addressed, will she confirm when she last met with the Protestant Church  representatives to convey to them that their issues had been satisfactorily  resolved? Can she inform the House why she was not present at a meeting that  took place in June with the Protestant   Church representatives?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: The Member well knows that, with the political will and support  of the Assembly, ESA can come into being, and it is important that it does. In  my answer, I outlined the potential savings from the establishment of ESA, but  I also know, and Members will all understand, the importance of dealing with  underachievement right across the North of Ireland, in areas such as the  Shankill and the Falls. The longer that we delay the establishment of ESA, the  more that the parties that are delaying it are condemning future and current  generations.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Answer.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: As the Member well knows, I have met the transferors regularly.  I answered Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n on that matter.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  Have the potential savings that are anticipated by the emergence of the  education and skills authority been achieved already owing to the control of  vacancies? Does the Minister plan to relax such control now to provide  much-needed stability for the education sector?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I plan to continue with the convergence programme, but our priority  is the establishment of the education and skills authority.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>:  Given that every organisation of any significance in the education sector  thinks that ESA should go ahead and that the issues around the transferors&rsquo;  problems are resolved or are being resolved, what is her understanding of the  reasons for the delay?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I am ready. The legislation to establish ESA is ready to go  through the House, and it has been to the Executive. It is an Executive policy,  and it is unfortunate that it has not been introduced yet. It is the  responsibility of all Members not to block or delay the establishment of the  education and skills authority. There is no reason to do that. As the Member  correctly said, all the issues have been resolved.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We cannot continue the dreadful waste on bureaucracy at  this time. This morning, people were talking to me about the need to get money  to the front line. The same people are not dealing with the issue of ESA in the  way in which they should be. We need to get money to the front line, and we  need to stop squandering public money on too many different organisations that  are not fit for purpose. We need the education and skills authority. I am  ready, and my Department is ready.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I have listened carefully to the Minister&rsquo;s replies. She said that the  establishment of ESA is a matter of political will. Will she not sit down with  other Ministers and interested parties to resolve all outstanding issues and  remove all obstacles to the full implementation of ESA? If it is a matter of  political will, why does she not initiate a process to do just that?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: On the day and hour that I came into office, I initiated a  process on the establishment of ESA. The first time that the matter came before  the Executive was on 19 July 2007. My door is open, and I have engaged with and  told all Ministers that I am ready and waiting. I have told all parties that I  am ready and waiting. The outstanding issues have all been resolved.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  No.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: We now need to move forward and stop attempting to block  necessary reform. Explain to the children on the Shankill Road and the Falls Road why you  are blocking reform that releases money to the front line and that is crucial  for dealing with the significant levels of underachievement in the system.  There is no explanation for it.</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Department of Education: Procurement</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-Question">4. <strong>Ms  Ritchie </strong>asked the Minister of Education for her assessment of the  procurement process within her Department for capital projects. (AQO 1542/11<a name="AQO1542/11" id="AQO1542/11"></a>)</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Sna tr&iacute; bliana a chuaigh thart, tugadh 35 thionscadal nua  olloibreacha scoile chun cr&iacute;che, rud a sheasann d&rsquo;infheist&iacute;ocht de thart f&aacute;  &pound;300 milli&uacute;n in east&aacute;t &aacute;r scoileanna lena chinnti&uacute; go m&uacute;intear &aacute;r bp&aacute;ist&iacute; sa  timpeallacht is fearr is f&eacute;idir le haghaidh foghlama agus forbartha.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Thirty five new major works schools projects have been procured  in the past three years. That represents an investment of around &pound;300 million  in our schools estate to ensure that our children are educated in the best  possible environment for learning and development. The new schools will provide  our children with state-of-the-art accommodation, up-to-date technology and  enhanced information technology systems. My Department is clear on the need to  ensure that capital projects are carried out in line with public procurement  policy and in accordance with the principles of best practice and equality. It  has communicated that to all boards and non-departmental public bodies.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her answer. I listened carefully to what she said.  However, I want the Minister to explain what steps she is taking to ensure that  the procurement procedure is fast and efficient and that projects are delivered  without the inordinate delays that are still part and parcel of the process.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: As the Member will know, we have speeded up school-build  processes significantly. We have built more schools and spent more money in the  past two years than at any other time. As I said in response to an earlier  question, we reduced our capital build underspend to nought last year. However,  we cannot be complacent. There is historical underinvestment.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I will continue to ensure that we will continue to use best  practice. We meet the education and library boards and work very closely with  the Department of Finance and Personnel&rsquo;s Central Procurement Directorate. The  Department of Education&rsquo;s permanent secretary sits on the procurement board,  which sets out procurement policy for all Departments and oversees  implementation of those policies and associated procedures and guidance. The  Central Procurement Directorate issues approved procedures and procurement  guidance directly to the bodies that are procuring, which includes the  education and library boards. I have also increased the frequency of the  governance and accountability meetings with all non-departmental public bodies.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I agree with the Member. It is essential that we move  forward with our school builds. I am delighted that we were able to announce 13  new school builds a few months ago.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>:  What discussions has the Minister had with the Minister of the Environment and  her Executive colleagues with regard to speeding up the planning process for  new school builds?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: As I outlined in my previous answer, my officials work actively  as part of the Central Procurement Directorate team. We work closely with all  Departments. At Executive level, I have regular discussions about matters such  as this.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms M Anderson</strong>: What  assurances can the Minister give that the procurement process is being  undertaken appropriately?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Sin ceist an-t&aacute;bhachtach. That is a very important question. It  is very important that the money that we receive is spent well and used wisely  in a way that adheres to all our statutory duties, including our equality  duties. That is especially important given the underinvestment in the schools  estate. I hold regular accountability meetings with all non-departmental public  bodies. As I said, my most senior official sits on the procurement board and  meets officials from all the different sectors. Procurement and capital build  is top of my agenda in meetings with senior officials on a weekly basis.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  What steps are taken to ensure value for money in procurement? What is the  Minister&rsquo;s assessment of the use of PPPs and PFIs?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: All our schools are built on the basis of value for money and  the need for investment in our schools estate. I am not particularly in  agreement with PPP projects. I do not believe that they are the best value for  money. Since coming into office, I have not initiated any new PPP projects. We  need to devise better ways in which to use public money rather than leave  future generations in debt.</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Schools: Health and Safety</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-Question">5. <strong>Mr  McGlone </strong>asked the Minister of Education how many schools reported health and  safety issues in relation to school buildings and grounds in the last three  years. (AQO 1543/11<a name="AQO1543/11" id="AQO1543/11"></a>)</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: In the course of running any school, health and safety issues  will arise, and the majority of schools in the estate have reported health and  safety issues in recent years. The issues can range from a broken window to a  roof falling in.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Le tr&iacute; bliana anuas, t&aacute; &pound;80 milli&uacute;n curtha ar f&aacute;il agam le  haghaidh cothabh&aacute;la scoile. Cuireadh &pound;190 milli&uacute;n eile ar f&aacute;il le haghaidh  mionoibreacha, agus caitheadh cuid de sin ar ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; sl&aacute;inte agus  s&aacute;bh&aacute;ilteachta. In the past three years, I have provided more than &pound;80 million  for school maintenance. A further &pound;190 million has been made available for  minor works, some of which has been for dealing with health and safety issues.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The truth is that we need significant additional funds to  deal with the legacy of underinvestment. We need to ensure that priority be  given to investment in education and that sufficient funding be available to  bring our schools up to the standards that our children deserve. I will  continue to press for funding for the schools estate. I assure the Member that  if additional funding were made available to my Department, it would be used  effectively.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as ucht  an fhreagra sin. I thank the Minister for her answer, but I would like more  clarification. Were the &pound;80 million and the &pound;190 million that the Minister  mentioned exclusively spent addressing major reported health and safety issues  in the schools estate?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I will write to the Member with a detailed answer to that  question. Health and safety issues are prioritised in line with criteria that I  agreed for this financial year.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Cuirtear saincheisteanna sl&aacute;inte is s&aacute;bh&aacute;ilteachta in ord  tosa&iacute;ochta de r&eacute;ir na gcrit&eacute;ar a chomhaontaigh m&eacute; don bhliain airgeadais seo.  Urgent health and safety work will be carried out where a risk has been  identified and can no longer be managed.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  The Minister will be aware that I recently wrote to her about the Rainey  Endowed grammar school in Magherafelt, which is in my constituency. I am sure  that she is aware of the school&rsquo;s difficulties with health and safety issues.  Can she assure the House that when and if moneys become available, she will  give the prospect of the school getting a newbuild a fair crack of the whip?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I will not comment on individual schools, but I will write to  the Member on that issue. The Member will be aware that Magherafelt got some  very good news in the last monitoring round, including a new high school,  primary school and preschool. That is good news for Magherafelt. There are  obviously other schools that need funding and resources, and I will fight my  corner for that funding. However, I can assure the Member that all our  investment will be made on the basis of statutory duties and fairness.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am grateful to the Minister. Can the Minister confirm the current shortfall  on health and safety maintenance in schools, and can we get an answer to the  original question that Mr McGlone posed, which was how many schools reported  health and safety issues concerning school buildings and grounds in the past  three years?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I will write to the Member with the detailed information that he  requests. Is &eacute; an caiteachas ar chothabh&aacute;il le tr&iacute; bliana anuas n&aacute; &pound;81&middot;21  milli&uacute;n. The spend on maintenance over the past three years has been &pound;81&middot;21  million. Every penny that we can direct to that area has been utilised. The  spend on minor works in the voluntary and maintained sectors in the past three  years is &pound;94&middot;4 million. The spend in the controlled sector by the education and  library boards for 2008-09 and 2009-2010 is &pound;93 million, and 80%, which is a  significant percentage of that spend, is attributable to health and safety  works.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I am grateful for the opportunity to raise a  point of order on the unsatisfactory answers that the Minister of Education has  been providing, particularly in respect of the question tabled by Mr McGlone.  Clearly, it was a specific request for information. However, the Minister  refused or was unable to provide an answer to the Member&rsquo;s question, let alone  the supplementary questions that flowed from it. Will any representations be  made to Ministers in respect of answering questions that are properly put to  them?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I listened to the Member&rsquo;s point of order. I continually say in the House that  I cannot and will not sit in judgement on how a Minister might answer a  question. If a Minister were to get up and absolutely refuse to answer a  question, that is totally different. I might have some role in that regard.  However, if a Minister makes some attempt to answer a question, I cannot sit in  judgement on whether that is the answer that the Member expected to get.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I say to the Member and to the entire House: take up the  issue directly with the Minister. Following it up with the Minister is perhaps  the way forward.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Further to that point of order, Mr Speaker, I ask you to review proceedings in  the Hansard report, with specific reference to the question that was tabled and  posed by Mr McGlone, to see whether you find or are able to establish the  answer. It was fairly well hidden from me and, I suspect, from the rest of the  House.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  We continually have wash-ups with Hansard. I am happy to look at Hansard.  However, I warn the entire House that it is not my job as Speaker to sit in  judgement on how any Minister answers a question. I say that to the entire  House.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I want to raise the issue of Members&rsquo; conduct.  On this occasion, I refer specifically to Mervyn Storey. During Question Time,  it was difficult to hear the Minister&rsquo;s responses to questions because of  Members&rsquo; constant jeering, which, quite frankly, is bad behaviour in my book. I  ask you to make a ruling on that.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I thank the Member for her point of order. I hope that, as far as possible, I  have brought Members to heel on that issue on a number of occasions. Once  again, I continually say in the House that, irrespective of who a Minister may  be, when he or she is asked a specific question, that Minister should be  allowed to answer that question without interruption or shouting across the  Floor. I continually say in the House that, irrespective of who a Minister may  be, I will give him or her cover to make representations in the role that he or  she has in the House. It is unfair to interrupt a Minister. I appreciate that  it is a debating Chamber and that there are issues and debates that rouse  Members&rsquo; emotions. That is understandable. However, even when a Member is on  his or her feet, it is courtesy and good behaviour to allow that Member to  continue his or her remarks without interruption. That also applies to a  Minister, irrespective of who he or she may be.</p>
<p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="a11" id="a11"></a>Ministerial Statements</p>
<p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Public Expenditure: Provisional Out-turn  2009-2010 and June Monitoring 2010-11</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice from the Minister of Finance and Personnel that he  wishes to make a statement.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr S Wilson)</strong>: Thank you, Mr Speaker, for the  opportunity to address the Assembly on Departments&rsquo; spending performance in  2009-2010 as well as to provide an update on the outcome of the June monitoring  process.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, the update is rather late because the  Executive&rsquo;s endorsement of the June monitoring proposals was obtained only  after the commencement of the summer recess. I thought it better to leave it  until now for Members to hear my statement, rather than to bring them back from  their holidays. Had I decided to do that, I might have been unpopular. As a  courtesy, I have already written to Members to advise them of the main  conclusions. In a few moments, I will comment on those in detail.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">First, I want to update the Assembly on the current  position vis-&agrave;-vis preparations for the new Budget to take us through the next  spending review period, commencing in 2011-12. I know that it is an issue that  is at the forefront of many Members&rsquo; thoughts.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Over recent weeks, I have conducted an initial series of  Budget bilaterals with my Executive colleagues. Those meetings were to allow  Ministers to set out their strategic priorities for the coming years and to  gauge how they would address the consequences of the tighter spending  constraints that will have to be imposed. The bilaterals were, largely, helpful  in giving me a sense of departmental pressures and priorities, but I take this  opportunity to record my growing unease at what I call the disconnect that was  made evident by some Ministers.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">In some quarters, there appears to be an unwillingness to  address the serious financial questions that are being posed. Let us be clear:  we cannot dodge difficult decisions in formulating a new Budget. Delaying the  Budget process until next spring is not an option. All Departments need to have  certainty on Budget allocations for 2011-12 by early in the new year at the  latest. That will allow them to decide how to allocate budgets to various  bodies, trusts etc, and that planning process is the framework which determines  how Departments and the wider public sector deliver services to our communities.  They need to know how much they are getting and what functions that covers.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">It is clear that the public are aware of the difficult  times that lie ahead, and the message that I am getting from the Budget  pre-consultation exercises with key stakeholders is that there is a demand for  leadership from the Executive and the Assembly. I assure the House that I will  do my utmost to expedite the Budget delivery.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I turn now to departmental spending performance in  2009-2010. I am pleased to announce that, on the basis of the provisional  out-turn position that was reported to my Department, the Executive have  delivered significant investment in public services in 2009-2010, with current  expenditure of &pound;9&middot;5 billion and net capital investment of &pound;1&middot;5 billion. In addition,  even with the shortfalls in capital receipts, Departments managed to deliver  &pound;1&middot;7 billion in gross capital investment. That is a slight increase of 0&middot;5% on  the previous year. That should be regarded as a major achievement for the  Executive, given the current economic climate. That strong performance in  difficult times is evidence of the proactive management of the public  expenditure position by my Department through the in-year monitoring process  and of the improved financial management displayed by Departments in recent  years.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">In relation to current expenditure, the overall underspend  by Northern Ireland Departments in 2009-2010 was &pound;65&middot;1 million. That equates to  a rate of 0&middot;7%, compared with 0&middot;5% in 2008-09 and 2&middot;1% in 2007-08. Although the  level of current expenditure underspend is slightly higher than it was in  2008-09, it is within acceptable levels and represents maintained improvement  when compared with previous years. Of course, that does not mean that we can  become complacent. It is important that financial management in Departments  continues to improve. Some Departments have more to do than others in that  area.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Departments displayed an underspend of &pound;8 million in  capital investment. That equates to 0&middot;5% of their final position. That is an  improvement on last year&rsquo;s performance, where, worryingly, there was an  overspend in departmental capital expenditure. However, once again, performance  varies between Departments, and the Departments in which performance is below  average have some work to do.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Further details on the provisional out-turn are set out in  the tables attached to the statement, and Members can peruse those details. The  spending performance of Departments in 2009-2010 is further evidence that the  Executive are delivering against the plans set out in the Budget, and there  should be no doubt that that is making a difference to the lives of people in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I will now turn to the June monitoring position for  2010-11. June monitoring is the first opportunity that the Executive have to  reallocate resources within the 2010-11 financial year. The financial position  is very constrained. Members will be aware that we already had to produce a  revised spending plan, which took &pound;393 million from departmental baselines this  year. A further pressure of &pound;128 million was created as a result of the UK  Government&rsquo;s 22 June 2010 Budget, which, through the mechanics of the Barnett  formula, cut our Budget further. The commencement of the June monitoring  deliberations had to factor in the need to address that additional unforeseen  pressure.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The review of 2010-11 spending plans has allowed us to  start the year with no overcommit&shy;ment in respect of either current investment  or capital expenditure. However, there remain significant issues, including the  additional &pound;128 million pressure as well as the considerable shortfall in  capital receipts that have to be addressed in the in-year monitoring process.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Before we discuss how those issues will be addressed, we  must first consider the resources available to the Executive in this monitoring  round and the other pressures raised by Departments. There was a total of &pound;20&middot;4  million capital expenditure, and &pound;286&middot;6 million of capital investment reduced  requirements surrendered in this round. That is money that Departments had  identified that they cannot spend in this year. The significant level of  capital investment reduced requirements includes amounts previously identified  in respect of slippage in the strategic waste infrastructure fund and the Royal  Exchange projects.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The current expenditure reduced requirements include &pound;6&middot;9  million in respect of the centrally held reserve used to provide match funding  to Departments for EU programmes. There is also &pound;5 million arising because of  extra regional rate income that has been generated through additional work  being undertaken by Land and Property Services (LPS). That additional  revenue-generating work is being undertaken at a cost of &pound;5 million, thus  generating a net reduced requirement benefiting the Northern Ireland block. Full  details of the reduced requirements are provided in the tables attached to the  statement.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">In addition to those reduced requirements, funding has  become available because of Barnett consequentials from the previous  Chancellor&rsquo;s Budget in March 2010, combined with various technical adjustments.  Those changes bring the total funding available to the Executive to &pound;41&middot;2  million of current expenditure and &pound;283&middot;7 million of capital investment. My  strong view is that every effort must be made to address the &pound;127&middot;8 million  reduction in funding this year. However, in acknowledging that the Executive  have an option of deferring some or all of that pressure until next year, I  also considered it important to address some key issues that have arisen in  Departments. Therefore, I will now turn to the bids that were submitted by  Departments in the June monitoring returns.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We identified bids of &pound;132&middot;8 million in respect of current  expenditure and &pound;405&middot;3 million for capital investment. Those included some  pressures already identified in the review of 2010-11 spending plans. A full  list of the bids submitted by Departments and the proposed allocations agreed  by the Executive in respect of them is included in the tables attached to the  statement. The allocations made in this round include &pound;20 million current  expenditure for the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in  respect of its first call on available resources. That was agreed as part of  that Department&rsquo;s 2008-2011 budget settlement. The early provision of that  allocation &mdash; in other years, it has sometimes been spread over a number of  spending reallocation rounds &mdash; will provide the Health Department with clarity  on its Budget position and allow it to make effective use of the resources  available to it.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Some &pound;200 million of capital investment has been made  available to DARD to address the extensive shortfall in the capital receipts  anticipated for Crossnacreevy in the Budget 2008-2011 process. That issue has  been the subject of extensive discussions, and, during the review of the  2010-11 spending plans, it was envisaged that that pressure would be met from  the slippage in the strategic waste infrastructure and Royal Exchange projects,  as, in fact, has been the case in this round.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Some &pound;13 million of capital investment has been allocated  to the Department of Education to help to ensure that important capital  investment in that sector continues. An allocation of &pound;10 million of capital  investment has been made to DSD for urban regeneration projects. Some &pound;28  million of capital investment has been made available for launch investment for  the Bombardier CSeries project, which will make an important contribution to  the local economy, especially as high-value jobs will be associated with the  project. A further &pound;1<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; ">&#8729;</span>4  million of capital investment has been allocated for the Fermanagh flooding  task force, an undertaking that the Executive had already made to people  affected by floods in Fermanagh around this time last year.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Some &pound;2 million of current expenditure has been made  available to DARD for animal disease compensation, which is a statutory  function and, therefore, represents a significant and inescapable cost. A total  of &pound;1 million of current investment and &pound;3&middot;6 million of capital investment has  been allocated to DARD for modulation match funding, which is required to fund  the Northern Ireland rural development programme, and &pound;2 million of capital  allowance has been made available to DOE to allow it to provide assistance to local  government for the costs of recycling and composting infrastructure, thereby  helping to avoid infraction fines from Europe.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We have also been able to provide funding to Departments  facing additional costs as a result of the devolution of policing and justice;  to DOE to help to address the shortfall in planning receipts and facilitate the  completion of the e-PIC project; and to DFP to enable it to carry out the 2011  census. An allocation has also been made in respect of the accommodation costs  of the Northern Ireland Civil Service office estate, which will be of benefit  to all Departments.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">In addition to the changes already detailed, in order to  further facilitate sound financial management within Departments, the Executive  have also allowed Departments to move resources across spending areas where the  movement reflects a proactive management decision taken to enable the  Department to better manage emerging pressures within its existing baselines.  Those Departments are to be commended for the actions that they have taken to  address pressures in that way. It has also been necessary, largely due to  technical issues, to reclassify some amounts between different categories of  expenditure, and details of those changes are provided in the tables attached  to Members&rsquo; copies of my statement.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I want to turn to the &pound;127&middot;8 million reduction in funding.  As I indicated, we are facing an additional pressure as a result of the  announcement by the UK Government that public spending would be reduced by &pound;6  billion this year. That reduction consists of &pound;89&middot;6 million in current  expenditure and &pound;38&middot;2 million in capital investment. Of that amount, &pound;22&middot;6  million relates to Barnett consequentials arising from reductions to policing  and justice-related functions in Whitehall Departments and, as it has already  been agreed that the Department of Justice&rsquo;s budget is to be ring-fenced in  2010-11, it falls to the Department of Justice to address that pressure. That  leaves a residual &pound;73&middot;8 million of current expenditure and &pound;31&middot;3 million of  capital investment to be addressed by the Executive. Using the residual funding  that was available after making allocations from the reduced requirements to  offset the pressure reduces those figures to &pound;64&middot;2 million of current  expenditure and &pound;10&middot;6 million of capital expenditure.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We have decided that the &pound;10&middot;6 million in capital  represents a reasonable level of overcommitment at this stage of the financial  year. Therefore, we are taking no action to deal with that at present. However,  it would not be prudent to leave the entire current expenditure pressure of  &pound;64&middot;2 million unaddressed at this time. Therefore, it has unfortunately been  necessary to apply reductions to departmental budgets in respect of that.  Although the preferred approach was to target low-priority areas, the reality  is that we simply did not have the time to pursue such an approach, and the  reductions have therefore been applied on a pro rata basis.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I felt that it was appropriate to consider how that should  apply to the Department of Health and the Department of Education when I was  determining the proposed approach to those reductions. In the case of the  Department of Education, it is clear that that sector underpins much of what  the Executive are seeking to achieve in social and economic cohesion. Where the  Department of Health is concerned, although that sector was afforded full  protection from in-year cuts at GB level, consideration must be given to the  relative efficiency of the Health Service here in absolute terms and relative  to the position in GB. Indeed, while acknowledging the needs of the health and  education sectors, it is important that the incentive for and likelihood of  increased efficiencies in those key spending areas are maintained and, if  possible, enhanced. In the light of that, I have proposed that the Department  of Education and the Department of Health be exempt from their share of the &pound;64  million reductions on the understanding that the respective Ministers agree to  work with DFP and commission PEDU to undertake work in the scope for and  delivery of significant cost reductions across both those sectors.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">In order to minimise the impact of that proposal on other  Departments, the reduction that would have fallen to those Departments &mdash; &pound;45&middot;1  million &mdash; has not been distributed across them but is instead being held  centrally for management throughout the remaining monitoring rounds of this  year. In other words, the remaining reduced requirements that will be  identified in the remaining monitoring rounds this year will have to cover that  central &pound;45 million pressure, with the safeguard that the option remains for  deferring any remaining balance to next year, should that not prove possible.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Many have questioned the rationale of the in-year  monitoring process. However, this monitoring round has allowed the Executive to  take measures to address a significant and unforeseen pressure arising as a  result of UK Government decisions while still making allocations of almost &pound;295  million to Departments.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Nevertheless, no matter how high the level of allocations,  there will always be areas where we would like to have done more or where  individual Ministers will say that we should have done more. However, with  current constraints on public expenditure, it is just not possible to provide  funding for every purpose. Ministers must take action to live within their  existing budgets. Efficiencies and savings will have to be made, and Ministers  will have to prioritise their spending plans to ensure that the limited  resources available are put to the best possible use. That is true of not only  the current year but the upcoming Budget period.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We are all aware of the difficult times that lie ahead, and  the time has come for the Executive and the Assembly to come together to make  the difficult decisions that are required to deliver the best possible outcome  for the people of Northern Ireland. I, therefore, commend the June monitoring  position to the Assembly.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel (Ms J McCann)</strong>: Go raibh maith  agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his statement. DFP had the  highest underspend for current expenditure of all the Departments, with a rate  of 3&middot;4%. Given that and given that that Department should be leading by example  in financial forecasting and management, what steps is the Minister taking to  ensure that a similar situation does not arise in the current financial year?</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">There are two parts to the statement, so I also wish to ask  a question about the June monitoring round. As regards the required additional  savings, what does the pro rata reduction equate to for DFP and what plans will  be put in place to deliver those savings in this financial year?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The Chairperson of the Committee is correct to say  that the underspend for DFP was 3&middot;4%. That was due to a combination of two  things. First, there were some non-cash costs due to depreciation on the cost  of capital, land and buildings, which would have been extremely hard to  forecast because of the timing of some of the work that was done. Secondly,  because of a good result for the Northern Ireland Budget involving some of the  central services that DFP looks after &mdash; namely HR Connect, Account Northern  Ireland etc &mdash; we reduced the costs of those services and, therefore, the spend  was not as high as was anticipated. There were savings to be had, hence the  underspend. Part of the underspend was due to good news. However, as I said, we  want to be able to manage budgets so that we do not have huge amounts of  underspend. I assure the Member that I asked exactly the same question of  officials in the Department, and we will seek to ensure that there is a better  performance next year.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Off the top of my head, I cannot give the Member the figure  for the reduction that there will be in the DFP budget as a result of our  contribution to the savings that have to be made in this financial year. Given  that the &pound;20 million savings are to be shared between eight Departments, DFP&rsquo;s  proportion of that will be fairly small &mdash; I think that it is less than &pound;1  million &mdash; and will be saved across a number of areas in the Department. I have  no doubt that when we are before the Committee the exact figure can be given.  However, if the Member wishes to have it sooner than that, we can make it  available to her.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. As he revealed, the commissioning of  PEDU to conduct critical work in the Depart&shy;ments of Health and Education was a  condition for exempting those Departments from their share of this year&rsquo;s cuts.  Will the Minister inform the House whether discussions have happened with both  those Departments and whether terms of reference and areas for examination have  been agreed for driving further efficiency into those Departments?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The Member is quite right. The Health and Education  Departments will escape a &pound;45 million reduction in their current combined  budgets as a result of that decision, and the Executive attached the very clear  condition that PEDU would go in and do some work to identify savings, which  would then take effect from the beginning of the next financial year.  Discussions have already been held between officials in my Department and the  two Departments involved to look at the terms of reference and the areas that  may be studied to try to identify savings. Those savings will then be signed  off on, and the work will be commenced in the autumn.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Some Members and Ministers see PEDU as a bit of a threat. I  want to emphasise that the work that PEDU does is as a result of agreement  between DFP and the Departments into which PEDU goes. A report, which is agreed  by the two Ministers involved, will be made available at the end of the work.  However, make no mistake: the reason for and objective of that work is to deliver  real savings that will then be available to the Departments in the next  financial year.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I asked the Minister to look at the June monitoring round. In his letter of 3  August 2010 to all Members, he advised that after pro rata cuts have been made  across all Departments, with the exception, as we heard, of the Health and  Education Departments, there will be a residual pressure of &pound;41&middot;1 million.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">4.00pm</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">In light of the calculated assumptions that he is making in  advance of next month&rsquo;s Westminster announcement, what options may exist to  address that &pound;45 million in the remaining monitoring rounds this year, without  going into next year? Will he also confirm that all Departments are fully  apprised of his assumptions &mdash;</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I encourage the Member to come to his question, or finish.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  If you had not interrupted me, I was just about to do that, Mr Speaker.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. I may ask the Member to take his seat and we will move on. I will allow  the Member to continue.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I have finished.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I will make it clear, so that I am not accused of  misleading the House. The overspend, or the commitment that we are carrying  forward, is &pound;45&middot;1 million in respect of current spending, and also &pound;10&middot;5  million in respect of capital spending, which we have not covered. Therefore,  there is a total of &pound;55&middot;6 million there.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We will seek in monitoring rounds in September, November  and February to obtain the funding to cover that gap. The Government made clear  to devolved Administrations that there was the ability to carry over. However,  I take it from the Member&rsquo;s question that he agrees with me that, given the  constraints that there will be next year, it is important that we try to  address that pressure this year rather than next year. That will certainly be  my objective in looking at any reduced requirements in the forthcoming  monitoring rounds.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  thank the Minister for the statement. I want to ask about the June monitoring  round. Obviously, we have a duty to look at all Depart&shy;ments in the round, and  not argue the cause for or against any particular Department. However, the  situation regarding the &pound;200 million at Crossnacreevy calls out for some  explanation.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">A number of Departments suffered a loss in capital receipts  due to the property downturn. The error in relation to Crossnacreevy was quite  different: that was a grossly erroneous valuation of land. Where that error lay  between the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) and the  Minister&rsquo;s own Department I do not know, and he may care to assign or accept  responsibility.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I encourage the Member to come to his question.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  However, given that that loss occurred, why was that &pound;200 million replaced in  its entirety to DARD, when other Departments were not treated with the same  generosity?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The Member has to understand that regardless of the  reason for the problem now as a result of the capital receipt from  Crossnacreevy not being realisable, we have to deal with it. Given that the  capital budget for DARD is about only &pound;25 million, and that its budget was  predicated on a capital receipt of &pound;200 million being available, there is no  way that the deficit can be made up through DARD&rsquo;s capital budget, because it  is such a small capital budget. For those bookkeeping arrangements, therefore,  the &pound;200 million had to be allocated to DARD.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The alternative &mdash; and maybe this is what the Member is  suggesting, although I suspect not, given the rural base of the SDLP &mdash; would be  absolutely no capital spending by DARD this year, next year or any other year  if we went down the route that he is suggesting. Many farmers would not be too  happy with that sort of arrangement.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  welcome the June monitoring statement, albeit in September. Given the quite  considerable reallocations in the statement, is there a danger of sending out a  confused message to the public, and to his fellow Ministers, about how serious  the situation facing us will be? It will not be just business as usual.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">With regard to tackling the &pound;128 million, and looking to  the future, given that the Conservative/Liberal right-of-centre coalition are  talking about a 77:23 split between spending cuts and the raising of additional  revenue, is the Minister seriously suggesting that we address our problems  entirely through cuts in spending?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I will answer the Member&rsquo;s first point, which was  about whether the huge amount of money gives a false sense of security. In  relation to the total Budget, the reallocations in the June monitoring round  have been very small, and, had it not been for the capital reallocation of &pound;260  million from the Royal Exchange project and the strategic waste infrastructure  fund, there would have been very little money available for reallocation.</p>
<p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, the picture is probably skewed by the money from  those two big projects and should in no way give the impression that there is a  fairly relaxed financial position. I could be proved wrong, but, once the money  from those two projects has been taken out, the amount available in this  monitoring round could be one of the smallest of any monitoring round in recent  years.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Looking to the Budget in the future and the split between  filling the gap through revenue raising or spending cuts; in previous debates I  have made it clear to the Member that there must be a combination of the two.  It would send out the wrong signals if there were no revenue-raising element in  the filling of that gap. Once we come to the main debate about the Budget  proposals, that is something that will have to be considered in more detail by  Members and the Executive. The Member is right; there must be a combination of  the two.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McQuillan</strong>:  I also thank the Minister for his statement. The provisional outturn shows that  last year saw a record &pound;1&middot;7 billion of investment in capital. Given that it is  likely that the Tory/Liberal Budget will target capital for the severest cuts,  how can the Executive and the Minister ensure that important investment in our  infrastructure is maintained?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The Member is quite right. Over the next four years,  we are looking at a reduction in the capital budget of 30%, which is a  considerable hit and will have a big impact. Given that about 56% of employment  in the construction industry relies on public sector contracts, it will have an  even greater impact on that sector. However, we have to move away from the huge  dependence that there is on the public sector, whether it is in the  construction industry or across a whole range of industries.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">As regards what the Executive can do to ensure that the  capital budget is protected in some way; I think that there are a number of  things that can be done. First, we have to ensure that we get value for money  from the capital spend &mdash; and there still will be considerable capital spend &mdash;  that we undertake, especially as construction prices are going down. There is  some scope for getting better value for money and more projects delivered for  that money.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, we could change some money from current spending  to capital spending. That will be a choice that the Executive and the Assembly  will have to make. That will have an impact on some services.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Thirdly, we will have to look for more opportunities for  receipts. It might well be that we have to make a decision that, even though we  might not maximise the income from the sale of a particular asset, nevertheless,  given what we want to spend the money on, it will be worth selling it at a  lower price than we would like, because that would enable us to deliver on some  capital projects.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Fourthly, although it is difficult to do so under public  expenditure rules, we have got to look at other ways to get additional private  money into public sector projects or into the infrastructure.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">In respect of that, today&rsquo;s statement from the DRD  Minister, in which he talked about re-nationalising the water service, is a retrograde  step. If that were done, the opportunities to attract private money into the  huge infrastructure needed for water would become less likely.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  statement. With the Minister&rsquo;s indulgence, I will ask two questions. Over the  summer, the Minister for Social Development raised concerns about the lack of  money in his budget. Can the Minister of Finance and Personnel disclose any  unfunded commitments that have been made by the Department for Social  Development?</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">My second question is about the June monitoring round.  Given that some &pound;10 million capital has been made available for urban  regeneration, is the Minister aware of any bids for the continuation of  neighbourhood renewal beyond March 2011?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The Member refers to comments made by the Social  Development Minister about urban regeneration and commitments made to it.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Let me make something clear: first, an additional &pound;10  million in capital was made available to the Minister for urban regeneration  projects. The Minister is not totally responsible for it, but he inherited from  his predecessor a large number and a significant value of unfunded commitments  for urban regeneration projects. That is unfortunate. Do not forget that many  other Ministers, such as the DEL Minister and the DRD Minister, complained that  none of their bids was met in the June monitoring round. Despite that, we found  &pound;10 million for urban regeneration projects. I understand that the present DSD  Minister is not responsible for signing up to unfunded urban regeneration  projects; nevertheless, the job of every Minister to live within budget.  Whatever problems a Minister inherits, he must live with them. There will be  other monitoring rounds and no doubt bids will be made during them, but they  will have to be judged against all the other demands from Departments.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Employment and Learning (Mrs D Kelly)</strong>: I thank the  Minister for his detailed statement, on page 5 of which he highlights the  underspend in relation to match funding for EU programmes. Surely that  represents a lost opportunity. The Minister is aware that the Special EU  Programmes Body appears to be delaying the funding and decisions on many  cross-border bids. I must declare an interest as a member of the East Border  Region Committee, which tries to ensure that those bids are funded. They  represent economic projects, and it is disappointing that that money has been  redistributed.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member please ask a question?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Employment and Learning</strong>: I refer the Minister to the  paragraph immediately below that. I seek clarification on the &pound;5 million  highlighted as extra income from Land and Property Services (LPS), which,  coincidentally, will cost &pound;5 million to realise.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Let me deal first with match funding. There are  several reasons why it is anticipated that some of the money held centrally for  the match funding of projects might not be used this year. In some cases,  because of their nature, projects will stretch over more than one year. The  Member mentioned delays in assessing projects, in some cases because there is  an element of savings because of changes in the exchange rate. That could be  another reason for the delay; in other cases, the projects simply do not run.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">That does not mean that the money has been lost. In some  cases it is just a re-profiling of projects, or real savings are to be had because  of benefits that result from movements in the exchange rate.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The &pound;5 million for additional rates income that I referred  to is as a result of additional funds that were made available to LPS. We have  now identified properties that were previously vacant; been able to undertake  work to get some cases to court and more quickly recover debt; and liaised with  the Enforcement of Judgments Office. We have been able to raise the &pound;5 million  as a result of that.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lyttle</strong>:  Does the Minister have a timetable for a draft Budget in the coming months, and  how much will that be linked to a new Programme for Government?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: There is a timetable for the draft Budget, and I  hope that the process will be completed by the beginning of the next calendar  year in January. As I said in my statement, Departments need some certainty  because what their budgets consist of will depend on what trusts and other  bodies get. They have to plan their spending. It is one thing for a Department  to get a windfall at the beginning of the year in a time when there is plenty  of money, but if there is going to be a reduction, it is almost impossible to  plan for if that Department does not know what is going to happen until the  beginning of the financial year.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The timetable is roughly as follows. I hope that, as a  result of the discussions that we have been having with Ministers and  Departments, a Budget proposal can go before the Executive some time towards  the end of September; that the Executive will approve that as a draft Budget;  and that it will then go to the Committees for consultation. The Committees can  examine the particular Budget proposals for their Department and consult with  various interested parties during the autumn. We will then be able to bring the  draft Budget to the Assembly to be finalised at the beginning of the next  calendar year.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">That is the optimistic view, but we have to try to live and  work towards that. We cannot allow it to drift. Last year, the Budget was  finally approved in, I think, the second week of the financial year. That is  unfair. If we stagger along at that rate this year, all we will do is bring the  Assembly into disrepute. People will also be angry if they do not know what  money will be available to them and how they can plan. Let us face it: we know  that, in some cases, there will be redundancies and cuts in budget. People expect  at the least to know in advance, not at the beginning of the financial year, so  that they are able to plan.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: I  note that the policy of ring-fencing the Justice Department has worked against  it this year to the tune of &pound;22&middot;6 million. Did the Minister give any  consideration to alternative approaches, given the pressure on the police in  particular in dealing with the dissident threat?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: First, it is not right to say that the policy of  ring-fencing has worked against the Department of Justice this year. The Member  has taken a look at one particular period &mdash; the June monitoring round &mdash; and at  the &pound;127&middot;8 million in savings that have to be made for this particular year. He  should not forget that, equally, ring-fencing enabled the Department to be  safeguarded against any reductions that had to be made in the Northern Ireland  Executive&rsquo;s Budget. The ring-fencing also enabled us to have some leverage with  the Treasury when it came to the kind of issues that the Member has talked  about, such as increased security pressures.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">To be fair, I do not think that the Minister of Justice has  complained about ring-fencing working in that way. I think that that is because  he has looked at the whole picture and seen that the Department of Justice  still probably stands to benefit from the ring-fencing that has been agreed.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Will the Minister confirm that,  although we are talking about health and education, the performance and efficiency  delivery unit (PEDU) reports in respect of any Department will be the property  of the respective Minister? I understand completely why the Minister took the  opportunity to lean on his colleagues, but I am a bit concerned that there may  remain some residual resistance from other Ministers. Given that health and  education are the two largest-spending ministries, will he confirm that it  would be extremely surprising and disappointing if PEDU were not able to  identify some efficiencies and savings, and that that itself could become a  positive and very powerful incentive for the other Ministers to do likewise?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I thank the Member for the point that he made. I  have no doubt that once PEDU goes into both of those Departments, it will  identify savings to be made. That is a double advantage for those Departments  because they are exempt from the reductions that have to be made this year, and  there will be ongoing savings for next year. Once those savings are identified,  they will be available to the Departments year on year. That is a good deal for  the Department of Education and the Department of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Since the Executive are undertaking to finance and look  after that exercise and also expect &mdash; I have emphasised this point in the  answers that I have given &mdash; that real savings will be delivered, the ownership  will be with the Ministers and the whole Executive. However, I cannot conceive  of any situation in which a Minister, when presented in a time of financial  constraint with a report that identifies efficiencies and savings, would not  accept it.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Girvan</strong>:  In light of the forthcoming cuts and reduced funding, Executive Ministers have  been asked to submit savings plans in advance of the October coalition Budget.  How seriously does the Minister think that his Executive colleagues are taking  that important exercise?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: As I pointed out at the very start, I was  disappointed by some of the engagements that I had with Ministers during August  in respect of their spending plans and savings plans. It is not a universal  disappointment; some have been more responsible than others. I am being kicked  continuously on my left leg by the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment. However,  the truth is that although we expected to see Departments&rsquo; savings proposals,  most have not been forthcoming. There will be a role for the Assembly and its  Committees in that regard because, ultimately, that is where the real scrutiny of  those savings plans will happen. It is important that Ministers engage with  their Committees and that Committees hold their Ministers to account. We  cannot, and must not, stumble into some half-baked response to the deficit  reduction plans that will be imposed on us. It has to be done with proper  consultation with the Assembly, and Ministers must engage with those who are  meant to scrutinise their Departments.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: The  Minister noted that the essential skills course for information and  communication technology (ICT) was not successful. Given that some 72,000  people have undertaken the essential skills courses in literacy and numeracy,  does he share my concern that if we fail in the essential skill of ICT and  effectively turn away eight out of every 10 people who are going to attend  further education colleges to get the ICT qualification, we will have damaged  our chances of being a true knowledge-based economy?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Ministers made many bids that were not acceded to.  As I made clear in my statement and during Question Time, despite the fact that  the Member for North Down thinks that we are sending out the wrong signal  because of the amount of money that was available for reallocation, we had a  limited amount of money. Consequently, many Ministers have been disappointed by  the failure of their bids to receive the money that they had hoped would be  reallocated. There will be other monitoring rounds, and it is open to every  Minister to make a strong case for particular aspects of his or her  Department&rsquo;s work. Failing that, the alternative is for Ministers to look  within their departmental budgets, which, I am sure, the Minister for  Employment and Learning is doing already because I have had constructive  discussions with him. For example, if the ICT skills project that the Member  mentioned is a high priority, from where could money be switched?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I also thank the Minister for his statement. With respect to the &pound;22&middot;6 million  pressure that the Department of Justice has to address as part of the &pound;127&middot;8  million reduction in funding this year, the Committee for Justice was advised  by departmental officials that the Barnett consequentials for policing and  justice had been applied too early. In their view, the Department should not  have to meet those cuts, and representations were made to the Treasury. Will  the Minister outline his understanding of the position? What discussions have  taken place with the Treasury?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: In negotiations for the devolution of policing and  justice, a package for identifiable pressures was agreed, and provision was  made for pressures that could not be identified but that it was anticipated  might emerge. That is still the case. Therefore, if security pressures emerge,  a reserve fund can be drawn down, and there is still end-of-year flexibility  and so on. There was never any understanding that the Department of Justice &mdash;  or the Home Office, as it is in the rest of the United Kingdom &mdash; would be exempt  from Barnett consequentials because of changes in allocations. Even if policing  and justice powers had not been devolved, the Northern Ireland Office would  have taken that share of the reductions in the Home Office&rsquo;s budget. The  Department of Justice is still protected from the pressures that were  identified during discussions about the devolution of policing and justice and  the pressures that were not identified but for which allowances were made. It  would experience in-year changes whether or not devolution had occurred.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Doherty</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  statement. With respect to the June monitoring round and the Crossnacreevy  question, will the Minister clarify that he did not actually, physically give  the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development &pound;200 million but that it  was a financial correction? In addition, will the Minister verify that, in  2007, when all the financial issues about Crossnacreevy were being discussed,  it was DFP&rsquo;s valuers who put a value of &pound;200 million on it?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I can absolutely assure the Member that I did not  physically stick &pound;200 million in a bag and walk down to Dundonald House and  hand it over to Michelle Gildernew. He is quite right: it was a bookkeeping  exercise, whereby the &pound;200 million that was anticipated has not been received,  so the transfer was made to ensure that a &pound;175 million deficit does not appear  on DARD&rsquo;s capital budget.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Frew</strong>: The  Minister&rsquo;s statement reflects a slight increase in current and capital  expenditure underspend last year. Will the Minister assure the House that that  is a one-off and that the good financial management of recent years will  continue?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: There was an increase in the current expenditure  underspend, but we must put into perspective that it was 0&middot;2% against a total  spend of &pound;9&middot;5 billion. If the Member thinks about it, it is akin to managing a  household budget, which is significantly less. It is not always possible to be  exact. During devolution, financial management has improved. Do not forget  that, under direct rule, we regularly handed back more than &pound;300 million every  year. We are now down to single figures, and we sometimes beat ourselves over  the head because of that.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The financial management has been better, but, as I said,  we must not be complacent. Money will be tight, and, at a time of economic  stringency, when money is voted to Departments, they should use it.</p>
<p class="H4StageHeading" style="page-break-before:always;"><a name="a12"></a>North/South  Ministerial Council:<br>
  Trade and Business Development Sectoral Format</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Speaker has received notice from the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment  that she wishes to make a statement.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment (Mrs Foster)</strong>: With your permission, Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish to  make a statement in compliance with section 52 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998  on a meeting of the North/South Ministerial Council in trade and business  development sectoral format. The meeting was held in the offices of the North/South  Ministerial Council in Armagh on Wednesday 30  June 2010. The Executive were represented by me, in my capacity as Minister for  Enterprise,  Trade and Investment and by Conor Murphy MP MLA, Minister for Regional  Development. The Irish Government were represented by Mr Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe TD,  Minister for Enterprise,  Trade and Innovation. The statement has been agreed with Minister Murphy, and I  make it on behalf of us both. Minister O&rsquo;Keeffe chaired the meeting.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The chief executive of InterTradeIreland, Mr Liam Nellis,  presented a progress report on that organisation&rsquo;s performance and business  activities. In particular, he noted the generation of &pound;83&middot;5 million business  development value; a total of 3,329 firms accessing InterTradeIreland&rsquo;s  information and business advice services; and 461 firms participating in  InterTradeIreland&rsquo;s programmes. He also referred to continuing discussions on  country of origin food labelling and the actions taken by InterTradeIreland to  date to address that issue.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">We took the opportunity to raise with Minister O&rsquo;Keeffe  concerns over recent developments and the protectionist policies being  developed in the Irish   Republic to change the  Bord Bia food labelling policy. We explained that the protectionist policy in  the Republic of Ireland is detrimental to both  jurisdictions and a barrier to free and open cross-border trade.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Ministers also received a presentation from the chairperson  of InterTradeIreland&rsquo;s board, Dr David Dobbin, who provided an update on the  organisation&rsquo;s strategic priorities for the body&rsquo;s next corporate plan for  2011-13. The Council approved InterTradeIreland&rsquo;s 2010 business plan and noted  its plans to identify and help to realise opportunities to improve  competitiveness, generate economic growth and create sustainable quality jobs  through increased trade, co-operation on innovation and business development  opportunities.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Ministers received a presentation on the InterTradeIreland  quarterly business monitor and noted the useful information that it provided on  the impact of recent economic developments on the private sector, the shape of  the recovery and competitiveness issues.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Ministers discussed a presentation on co-operation on  innovation. They noted the collaborative work by Enterprise  Ireland, Invest Northern Ireland and  InterTradeIreland to identify possible sources of additional funding for  innovation programmes and to gain access to research institute resources.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Ministers noted the approval of five proposals with a total  value of &pound;10&middot;7 million under the US and Ireland R&amp;D partnership  and the plans to allow an expansion of the partnership topics to include  telecommunications and energy research. Ministers also noted that  InterTradeIreland will carry out an analysis of the innovation ecosystem and  that InterTradeIreland&rsquo;s draft accounts for 2009 had been submitted to the  Comptroller and Auditor General in both jurisdictions. I commend the statement  to the Assembly.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment (Mr A Maginness)</strong>: I thank the Minister for her  statement, which, as usual, was very comprehensive and detailed. The statement  highlights the work of InterTradeIreland, and the figures reported indicate a  good performance by that organisation. Will the Minister assure the House that  InterTradeIreland has her full support and continues to work well? In these  difficult times, the success of an organisation that promotes trade between  both parts of Ireland  makes a tremendous contribution to working a way through and out of recession.  I ask the Minister to comment on that.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Minister also rightly referred to the problems  encountered with country of origin food labelling. Will the Minister enlighten  the House as to how that issue will be fully resolved?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: I thank the Chairperson for his question. If I recall  correctly, he asked similar questions the last time I came to the House with a  statement concerning InterTradeIreland, and I say again that that body is doing  good work. However, as the Chairperson would expect, I will always provide a  challenge function to that work to ensure that companies in Northern Ireland  get the optimum amount of help from InterTradeIreland. The key point about  InterTradeIreland and what differentiates it from Invest Northern Ireland is its  function to help small businesses with their exports. Some people think that  there is duplication between those two bodies, and I am always conscious of  that. However, for many smaller companies in Northern Ireland, InterTradeIreland  offers an opportunity to experience an export market for the first time. That  is an important function of InterTradeIreland, and it can lead to some of those  companies exporting to the rest of Europe and  globally.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson rightly raised the issue of country of  origin food labelling, which has concerned me for some time. I raised it with  the Irish Agriculture Minister on the sidelines of an NSMC plenary meeting, and  I am waiting for him to come back to me on that. InterTradeIreland promotes  trade between the two jurisdictions on this island, therefore I raised the  issue with the chairman and the chief executive of InterTradeIreland. It is a  real issue for us because one third of all exports between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland  are food-related. I do not want the issue to escalate into something that could  cause real difficulties not just for Northern   Ireland but for the Republic of Ireland.  If Northern Ireland products  are not as competitive as Republic of Ireland products, it may be that producers there have  difficulties when they go to sell their products in the United Kingdom.  We certainly do not want the issue escalating into something that cannot be  handled, so I will continue to push InterTradeIreland to deal with it. However,  the Government of the Republic   of Ireland also have a  responsibility to ensure that the issue does not escalate into one that cannot  be dealt with.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Frew</strong>: If  the Minister can, will she comment on the PAC report on InterTradeIreland that  was published recently?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: Unfortunately, there is little that I can say about that report.  DETI has been through the report with DFP and has undertaken a detailed and  careful consideration of the points made by PAC.  A detailed response will be laid in the Assembly in the form of a memorandum of  reply, which will also be published on DFP&rsquo;s website. Suffice it to say that we  will deal with the issues raised in that report.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for her  statement. InterTradeIreland has published quarterly all-Ireland business  monitor reports since 2007. Its latest report stated that 50% of businesses in  both jurisdictions reported that the recession had impacted on them more  severely than at any time since the surveys began. Does the Minister agree that  both jurisdictions need to pool their resources and expertise in innovation,  because that is the way in which we will come out of the recession in a much  better position? There is also the issue of regulatory barriers deterring  businesses in both jurisdictions from developing on an all-Ireland basis.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: I will address the last point first: some programmes that have  been developed by InterTradeIreland are precisely to deal with any barriers,  perceived or otherwise. For example, there is the Network and Get Work  programme, and InterTradeIreland has run good procurement programmes. If the  Member is aware of any barriers that he thinks InterTradeIreland should deal  with, I am certainly happy to take those up with the chairperson and the chief  executive. InterTradeIreland is focused on dealing with those issues, which is  why it developed the programmes.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The business monitor is a useful early indicator of  business confidence. It gets information from around 1,000 senior executives &mdash;  500 from Northern Ireland  and 500 from the Republic of Ireland  &mdash; who are asked specific questions about how their businesses are doing and so  on. I recently had a conversation with the chairperson and chief executive  about the business monitor, and I think that the next business monitor will  look at access to credit and other such issues. I am sure that, over the  summer, Members will again have dealt with small businesses that are having  difficulties with access to credit and with banking, which is an ongoing issue.  I would even go as far as to say that it is an escalating difficulty for small  businesses. I want to know the scale of it in Northern   Ireland, and I am sure that Minister O&rsquo;Keeffe will want  to know the scale of it in the Republic   of Ireland. We hope that  the business monitor will take a brushstroke approach, as opposed to providing  qualitative data, about where business confidence is on banking. I hope that  the next business monitor will be able to deal with that.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Innovation is certainly a key priority for InterTradeIreland.  The Member may know that Minister O&rsquo;Keeffe and I hope to meet the European  Commissioner for Research, Innovation and Science, M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, in  the near future to find out what extra finances we can glean from European  funds to add to the funds that come nationally for innovation. We believe that  that is the way forward, and it complies with the independent review of  economic policy in Northern    Ireland. Innovation is what we want.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her statement, which was, as usual, very interesting. I  share the Minister&rsquo;s concern about protectionism. I was wondering what Minister  O&rsquo;Keeffe&rsquo;s response was to the Minister when she raised the issue of  protectionism. Did he say anything? The Minister&rsquo;s statement does not mention it.  I cannot help but contrast that with innovation, where there are examples of  intellectual property. Innovation can be a private issue for firms in the same  industry, and instances of competitive intellectual property can be involved.  The protectionist policy on food labelling is in contrast to what we are meant  to be doing through co-operation to drive businesses forward. Will the Minister  comment on that?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: The Member is absolutely right about innovation in that many  people do not want other people to see their ideas and what is going on. We  tried to widen the whole aspect of innovation through universities working with  small businesses so that they can grow those businesses to the next level of  research and development or through pure innovation. Much work is still to be  done on innovation, but some of the collaborative partnerships that developed  as a result of InterTradeIreland programmes work well.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">When I visited Augher creamery recently, I had the opportunity  to see the way in which the FUSION programme works very effectively. A graduate  from a technical college in the Republic of Ireland &mdash; I cannot remember which  one &mdash; was working in Augher creamery, and she had &mdash; I do not want to exaggerate  &mdash;transformed the way that that business works. We need to encourage such  practices and partnerships, which have worked very well.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I will continue to push on the issue of protectionism  because, if it gets out of hand, it will be a real problem for Northern Ireland.  I have already said that one third of all trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland  is in the food sector. Therefore, we cannot afford to allow protectionism to  grow to the next level. At present, there is a review of country of origin  labelling, and, when the review is complete, I hope that the right answer comes  out whereby this is all dropped and we continue to work on a free market basis.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her statement and am pleased to hear of her continued  support for InterTradeIreland. She provided statistics on the take-up of  InterTradeIreland&rsquo;s facilities and programmes and outlined the number of  companies that have got involved. Can she provide us with any breakdown of the  number of companies from Northern Ireland  and from the Republic   of Ireland that have  taken up use of the facilities?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: Unfortunately, I do not have that information in front of me at  the moment. However, I am happy to provide the Member with that and place a  copy of the letter in the Library for other Members to see.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for her  statement and welcome some of the comments in it, particularly those about  generating economic growth and creating sustainable, quality jobs through  increased all-island co-operation. Does she agree that a harmonisation of  taxation across the island would go a long way to breaking down those barriers  and developing trade and business?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: That is, clearly,  not a matter for me because fiscal policy resides at our national Parliament in  Westminster.  That being the case, we will continue to deal with policies that will help  Northern Ireland companies to develop, trade more with the Republic of Ireland  and, in doing so, hopefully increase the number of businesses that take up  InterTradeIreland&rsquo;s programmes. There are some very good programmes that are of  benefit to businesses in Northern Ireland,  and, as long as there is benefit to businesses in Northern Ireland, I will continue  to support them.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>:  Will the Minister give us an assurance that, at a time of severe public  pressure on our finances, any duplication between InterTradeIreland and her  Department or agencies such as Invest NI will not be tolerated?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: I raised that matter with InterTradeIreland when I came into my  post over two years ago. InterTradeIreland and Invest Northern Ireland have  very different remits and roles. Therefore, in theory, there should be no  duplication between the two bodies. However, I was concerned at that time, and,  because of that concern, I continue to keep an eye on it. It is helped by the  fact that the chairperson of InterTradeIreland, David Dobbin, is also on the  board of Invest Northern Ireland  and, therefore, has sight of everything that happens in both bodies. As well as  that, there is a system whereby senior Invest Northern Ireland  officials sit on the steering groups of InterTradeIreland&rsquo;s major programmes,  such as FUSION, which I have already mentioned, Acumen, INNOVA, Go-2-Tender and  EquityNetwork. Furthermore, there are Invest Northern Ireland  representatives on the steering groups for its major business and economic  policy reports. That reflects the fact that InterTradeIreland is trying to deal  with the concern of duplication because, in tightened financial circumstances,  we certainly do not want duplication in the work of two public bodies.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McHugh</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for her  statement. This NSMC meeting is probably one of the most important cross-border  meetings not only to monitor the recession but to monitor the economy, which is  an important area of work in the North and the South.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The banks&rsquo; current position is one of self-preservation in  which they refinance before releasing cash to small, new or innovative  businesses. Can the Minister say how much the recession and the position of the  banks will affect job targets and the number of jobs that will be created by  this work over the next few years?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: InterTradeIreland is  not principally a job-creation organisation, although that is a very helpful  by-product of trade activities between Northern   Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  Despite the fact that it is not a job-creation body, InterTradeIreland has  managed to create somewhere in the region of 211 jobs over the past year.  However, its prime focus is to ensure that companies that want to export into  the Republic of Ireland, and vice versa, will have the  tools to be able to do so in an important way. For those reasons, I have  specifically asked InterTradeIreland to ask senior executives in both the Republic of Ireland  and Northern Ireland,  in its next quarterly business monitor, about the banks, access to credit and  how that is affecting their businesses. We need to be told that.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">From an Executive point of view, the Minister of Finance  and Personnel, the First Minister, the deputy First Minister and I all meet the  banks. The banks tell us that they are lending, that they have never lent so  much, that they are open for business, and all of those things. However, I know  from speaking to colleagues &mdash; we are meeting small businesses on a day-to-day  basis &mdash; that that is simply not the case on the ground, whether it is because  the banks are increasing their fees, are cutting down on their overdrafts, or  are just not interested in financing start-up businesses.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">There is a disconnect between what we are being told by the  banks and by people on the ground. Something needs to be done about that. Our powers  are limited, given that we have no controls over the banks. However, we will  keep pushing the banks to ensure that we get some response from them in  relation to these matters.</p>

<p class="H4StageHeading">Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance (Lone Parents) (Availability for  Work) <br>
  Regulations (Northern    Ireland) 2010</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development (Mr Attwood)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
<p class="Q3Motion">That the Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance (Lone Parents) (Availability  for Work) Regulations (Northern    Ireland) 2010 be approved.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The regulations, which were laid before the Assembly on 1  April 2010, provide a guarantee that lone parents with a youngest child of 12  or under who receive jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance will have the right to restrict  their availability for work to their children&rsquo;s school hours. The regulations  augment other flexibilities, some pre-existing and others added by the recent  Welfare Reform Act (Northern    Ireland) 2010, which hope to strike a  balance between the requirement on parents to undertake work or work-related  activities and the need for children to be raised in a secure environment with  an involved parent or parents.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I am aware that, since I last spoke in the Assembly, there  have been many significant and profound welfare proposals and developments.  Indeed, some are of grave concern, and I may comment on those shortly. However,  for the purposes of these regulations, it is important to help more people to  find work, to move people out of poverty, to grow the economy to ensure that  people can achieve their aspirations and those of their families, and to  eradicate child poverty.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Jobseekers are normally expected to be available for work  for up to 40 hours a week. There are, however, a number of existing  flexibilities that qualify that requirement for certain people whose personal  circumstances may inhibit their ability to work full time or to look for work  on a full-time basis. In particular, the flexibilities for lone parents  claiming jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (JSA) were strengthened when the lone parent  obligations were introduced in December 2008. Those measures allow lone parents  to limit their availability for work, in discussion with a personal adviser, to  a minimum of 16 hours a week to take account of their childcare  responsibilities. The measures also allow them to refuse a job or to leave  employment if that childcare is not available.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">A further measure was introduced by the recent Welfare  Reform Act (Northern Ireland)  2010, which places a requirement on personal advisers to take the well-being of  any child affected into account when drawing up a jobseeker&rsquo;s agreement. Those  agreements frame the job-seeking action that follows, so this is an addition to  the safeguards. Such flexibilities and safeguards are essential. The efforts to  help people back into work would be damaged if the difficult social  circumstances in which many people find themselves were not recognised.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The regulations strengthen one of the existing flexibilities  for lone parents on jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance. They give eligible lone parents,  that is lone parents with a child of 12 years of age or younger, the right to  limit their hours of availability to their child&rsquo;s school hours. It puts the  power to determine their availability at the hands of lone parents, because  they are best placed to make judgements about their responsibilities and  lifestyles. It will assist lone parents who have predictable availability for  work because their children attend for conventional school hours, that is, a  regular daily pattern from Monday to Friday. That should cover the normal  experience of the majority of lone parents.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Lone parents whose children&rsquo;s school hours fall outside a  regular pattern of attendance for the time being, or perhaps permanently for a  particular reason, can instead make use of the flexibility which allows them to  reduce their availability for work in discussion with an adviser. If parents  have difficulty during the school holidays, they can make use of the  flexibility in the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance regulations, which enables parents to  be deemed unavailable for work during the school holidays if no appropriate  childcare is available.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">That is a simple change, but it could have a significant  impact on the lives of lone parent jobseekers all over Northern Ireland.  However, as Members know, there are far from simple changes being talked about  at Treasury, at the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) and in the London  Government. I have been warning that there is a clear risk that Treasury may  prevail over DWP in the current welfare debate. Whatever the intentions of the  Secretary of State for welfare, Iain Duncan Smith &mdash; some of which may be good &mdash;  his ambitions and intentions would be compromised en bloc by the welfare-slashing  intentions of the Treasury. That is why, over the past couple of months, I have  met the Welfare Reform Minister, Lord Freud, in London and the Secretary of State for  welfare, Iain Duncan Smith. I have made the argument that Iain Duncan Smith&rsquo;s  own institute in Northern    Ireland seems to adopt, which is that there  are particular circumstances and levels of deprivation, disadvantage and  poverty over the generations, compounded by emigration, and now complicated by  the legacy of conflict. As a consequence of that, when it comes to welfare  reform in the future, Northern Ireland must be treated as the particular case  that it clearly is.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I have also made the argument over the past couple of  months, and I will make it again now, that whatever the London Budget may or  may not mean in respect of the Northern Ireland block, when it comes to  decisions around the Executive table in Northern Ireland, we must not impose  upon those people who are already in need, stress and disadvantage any  additional burdens in this time of recession, which is going to continue at  least until the end of 2012. As a consequence of that, there will be no new  jobs in the context of potentially fewer public sector jobs.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Given the evidence that is beginning to emerge from the  Institute of Fiscal Studies in London in respect of the emergency Budget a  couple of months ago, in respect of the BBC report last week on of the impact  on the north-east of England in the event of public sector cuts where there was  a higher dependency on public sector jobs, and given the report in &lsquo;The  Observer&rsquo; yesterday about the potential cuts in welfare over the next period  beyond what we had envisaged, there is a particular responsibility in my view,  not just in London but in respect of this Executive, to protect those in need,  disadvantage and stress when it comes to the budgetary discussions. Without  prejudice to all of that, I beg to move the regulations.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development (Mr Hamilton)</strong>: The Committee for  Social Development considered the Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance (Lone Parents)  (Availability for Work) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2010 at its  meetings of 11 March and 15 April. As the Minister indicated, the purpose of  the statutory rule is to give lone parents on jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance with  children aged 12 or under a right to restrict their availability for work to  suit their child&rsquo;s school commitments without a loss of benefits. The rule may  be viewed as recognition that in the absence of so-called wraparound childcare,  lone parents who have young children cannot be subject to the same benefit  conditionality regime as other claimants.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">In response to queries raised by the Committee, I can  advise that the Department has provided assurances that during school holidays  the normal safeguards for lone parents exist, that is to say that lone parents  are eligible to claim JSA if they are available to work and are not obliged to  take up employment if they do not have access to childcare.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">As part of its deliberations, the Committee sought feedback  on the impact of the rule on lone parents. I recently learned from the  Department that, as the Minister has indicated, up until June 2010 only a small  number of lone parents have sought to restrict their availability for work. I  am glad to advise the Assembly that I understand that benefit agencies have  allowed those parents to restrict their availability without loss of benefits.</p>
<p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Committee agreed to support that beneficial statutory  rule. The Committee would also support the view that, in respect of welfare  reform measures for vulnerable groups, such as lone parents, extensive data  should be collected by the Social Security Agency on the impact of such  reforms. In this case, such data could usefully inform the development of a childcare  strategy for Northern    Ireland.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, given the beneficial nature of that particular  rule, the Committee is happy to recommend that it be confirmed by the Assembly.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: As  the Committee Chairperson stated, the Department was asked to provide  information on the impact of the rule before its confirmation by the Assembly.  The Department advised that it was unable to provide detailed data. For various  reasons, 141 lone parents sought to restrict their availability for work. The  Minister stated that that flexibility was allowed.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">As the Minister is aware, Sinn F&eacute;in is unhappy with many  aspects of the Welfare Reform Bill. My party put forward a number of proposals.  It is parity legislation. Presumably, parity, by definition, means to compare  like with like. Unfortunately, much of that legislation does not compare like  with like. The Minister states that this particular rule will provide for lone  parents whose youngest child is 12 years old or under. Obviously, further down  that road, lone parents whose youngest child is five years old or, possibly,  one year old will have to satisfy requirements for work. In fairness, the  Minister has stated that he will bend flexibility as far as possible within the  context of parity.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">For many lone parents, the difficulty lies with other  benefits that are available, such as working tax credit. Before I am told that  that is not within the Minister&rsquo;s remit, I will point out that I understand  that. However, it is difficult to make legislation that affects lone parents  without addressing other issues, such as the childcare element of working tax  credit.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The Committee has examined the rule in some detail. As the  Chairperson said, it agreed to recommend the rule, although some members were  unhappy to do so. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>:  Although the issue attracts strong opinions, the regulations that are before  the House are straightforward. Those regulations are designed to ensure parity  between Northern Ireland and  Great Britain.  As a unionist, I am committed to ensure that the parity principle is  maintained, especially in these times of financial constraint.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the easements that the regulations will  establish. In light of the fact that childcare is limited in Northern Ireland,  the ability to restrict availability for employment to a child&rsquo;s normal school  hours is a welcome step. That will help single parents to gain jobseeker&rsquo;s  allowance. It will also help them to gain employment, and I believe that  everyone would agree that that is the best way to address poverty &mdash; especially  child poverty &mdash; and cycles of deprivation.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Although these regulations will not increase the  availability of work, they are a welcome piece of the wider jigsaw of helping  people to get jobs, grow the economy, and break cycles of poverty. I welcome  the regulations.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  It takes a great deal of money to fund such measures. Have the Education or  Health Ministers considered giving additional funding to help with that?</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  want to thank the Minister. He is sympathetic to communities. I look forward to  hearing more positive results from his discussions with Westminster.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Earlier today, I consulted Gingerbread about the  legislation. It certainly welcomes the establishment of those easements. It  says that that is one area in particular that must be dealt with through  regulations. As other Members said, the lack of available childcare continues  to cause difficulties for many lone parents. There are access and affordability  difficulties, and parents constantly struggle with parenting and working. The  regulations are compassionate and more flexible for lone parents, all of whom  want to work. However, their priorities are often with their children, and  rightly so. Children&rsquo;s welfare must be paramount in our policies and decisions.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Those of us who are parents, and who know how difficult it  is when children are young and when parents are struggling with work and  looking for help with childcare, should recognise the work of parents who are  at home looking after children. Those parents bring up decent young people, and  that is a contribution that they make to society.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I call the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety.  I beg your pardon: I call the Minister for Social Development.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I have slightly more hair.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  He looks like the Health Minister.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I do not behave like him, though. I welcome the  consensus in the House for the regulations, and I thank the Committee for the  positive way in which it dealt with them. I am sure that that will be a  template for our relationship over the next nine months.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I want to stress a number of points. Mr Brady and Mr  Hamilton referred to how the lone parent obligations have operated since their  introduction in December 2008. It is worth emphasising what the Committee  Chairperson and Mr Brady said: any lone parents who want to restrict their  availability are able to do so. There were 141 requests, and all requests were  allowed. That says a number of things about the welfare system in Northern Ireland.  First, it says that there is a level of understanding in the Social Security  Agency around lone parent issues and around the need for flexibility when  dealing with lone parents&rsquo; care and responsibilities. Secondly, it says that  the training and direction worked itself through the agency to produce a  situation in which 141 requests were allowed.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">It also reflects something that was said by Eileen Evason,  whom I consider to be the foremost expert on welfare and child poverty in Northern Ireland.  She has been saying that, whatever the character and gravity of welfare reforms  that might have been rolled out to date, the Social Security Agency and its  staff have measured up in their obligations to the customer, particularly to  those in most acute need, as is evidenced by the operation of the lone parent  regulations.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">That emphasises another point. When it comes to the Budget  negotiations, it is not only the teacher and the nurse who should be seen as  providing a front line service in Northern Ireland but the people who  work in child maintenance, social security, the Housing Executive and  neighbourhood renewal. They need to be protected, because the nature of their  work is to help people who are in need, stress and disadvantage and who are  looking for opportunity.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">Mr Brady and Mrs Bradley raised the issue of childcare. I  compliment Mr Brady on his neat use of language. He said that he was unhappy to  agree to the regulations. I think that I will use that form of words in future  when it comes to &mdash;</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  I thought that you used that form of words regularly, Alex.</p>
<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Not quite those words, but I will use those words in  order to demonstrate my distance from welfare reform proposals in London.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The broader issue is that flexibilities around access to  affordable childcare are built into the welfare benefit system, because access  to affordable childcare in Northern    Ireland is restricted to around 20% of those  who seek it. That is unlike the situation in parts of Britain, especially in parts of England where  accessibility is up to 80%. Although it is difficult to roll out a childcare  strategy, and although it is very expensive, which is, presumably, one of the  reasons that, thus far, the structures in the Executive dealing with the issue  have yet to produce the final result, we cannot put it off for ever and a day.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">To answer Mrs Bradley&rsquo;s question more directly, and I will  be very frank, as I tend to be with the Assembly, it was put to me that in  considering my budget bid, I would want to look at the funding that the  Department for Social Development provides for projects that include childcare  provision. I was asked whether I would want to reconsider that, and I said that  I would not. I know that Mr Hamilton thinks that that is a big part of my  savings plan, but in the big Budget bid that was put in five or six weeks ago,  I made a bid for the continuation of DSD funding for projects that include  childcare. In the absence of an overarching interdepartmental agreed strategy  with the money to fund childcare, it falls to each Department to measure up as  best they can, rather than to let childcare provision go to the wall, which is  the danger.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">I stress that, beyond the lone parent regulations that are  being approved today, other flexibilities in the social security system that  relate to the needs of parents cover quite a number of bases. Just as there  have been 141 requests for restricted availability for lone parent obligations,  there are wider flexibilities for all parents. I trust that each of us, through  our offices and through the system generally, will exploit those opportunities  so that we can deal with whatever may come across the Irish Sea from London. Indeed, I will  negotiate hard with London  to resist much of that if I am able to, and I am sure that I will be supported  by the Assembly, the Executive and the Committee for Regional Development in  that. Nonetheless, a number of flexibilities remain that people in the  community and those giving advice should exploit to the full to ensure that  parents, not least lone parents, get the benefit of the system rather than be  impeded by it.</p>

<p class="Q3Motion">That, in accordance with Standing Order 33(4), the period  referred to in Standing Order 33(2) be extended to 17 December 2010, in  relation to the Committee Stage of the Commissioner for Older People Bill [NIA  Bill 21/09].</p>
<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Commissioner for Older People Bill passed its  Second Stage on 7 June 2010 and was referred to the Committee for the Office of  the First Minister and deputy First Minister (OFMDFM) on the same day. The Bill  is a piece of legislation that seeks to provide for the appointment and the  functions of a Commissioner for Older People for Northern Ireland. The Bill has 29  clauses and three schedules. The clauses establish the Commissioner for Older  People and set out the principal aim of the Commissioner. The clauses also set  out the functions of the Commissioner.</p>
<p class="B3BodyText">The OFMDFM Committee has considered the Bill on a number of  occasions, and has received written and oral evidence from a number of  stakeholders in the sector and from the Department.

The Committee is seeking an  extension until 17 December 2010 to allow it to fully scrutinise and consider  possible amendments to the Commissioner for Older People Bill. The extension  would allow the Committee to deliver on other commitments and Bills scheduled  to come to the Committee shortly. I ask the Members for their support.</p>
