	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 10.30 am (Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr  Dallat] in the Chair).</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="1"></a>Assembly Business</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. The material that I have before me is  not an alternative to the newspaper that the Member for West Tyrone Mr McElduff  accused me of reading in the Chamber yesterday. Rather, it represents the  amount of written material that I received from the Assembly in the two weeks  before the Christmas recess. The material stands 1 ft 8 in high &mdash; I have a  ruler with me should I need to prove that. It follows that, if a full month&rsquo;s  material, multiplied by 108 MLAs, were stood end to end, we would need a  bookshelf that stretched from one side of this Building to the other &mdash; 365 ft &mdash;  to facilitate it all.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to raise with the Assembly  Commission what we can &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Mr Wilson.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  &mdash; do to avoid that waste of paper, because I understand that all this material  is available online.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: We have now gone metric, Mr Wilson. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.] I shall make two points: first, Members are not permitted to use visual aids in  the <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">Chamber; and, secondly, you are probably  embarrassing the Minister of the Environment. I shall continue.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: On  a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I raised a point of order yesterday, but,  unfortunately, the Speaker had just left the Chair. It related to an important  issue, however, not only for me but for the entire Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">During questions to the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development after her statement on the  December Fisheries Council meeting, I asked a question that contained  not one, not two, not three but four separate questions. I have the Hansard  report in front of me, and it is very <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">clear  that I asked four questions. The Minister&rsquo;s response was that she did  not hear a question, and, therefore, she refused to respond to any of the  points that I had made. <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">She did not fail to  hear; rather, she did not want to hear, because she was embarrassed by  the questions that I had asked.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, what was even more worrying was the Speaker&rsquo;s  response that he did not hear any questions either. If Ministers are able to  hide behind awkward, difficult questions simply by saying that they do not hear  them, that is a very dangerous precedent for the Assembly to set. Ministers  must be held to account; they must answer questions, even those that they do  not want to answer.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is unfortunate, Mr  Deputy Speaker, that the Speaker does not appear to have ruled on that  issue, so I ask that you convey my sentiments to him and ask him to rule on  this important matter as quickly as possible.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I will certainly do that. The good  news is that the Speaker is aware of your point of order and will be in touch  with you, so it is happy days.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: I  am delighted.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McIlveen</strong>:  I wish to raise a point of order in relation to yesterday&rsquo;s Question Time. I  asked a valid question of the Minister of Education regarding how she  prioritises her budget. Is it in order for her to label my comments as  sectarian, when they clearly related to the budget?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I will certainly pass your comments to the Speaker, who will, no  doubt, be in touch with you, as with Mr Wells.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="2"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">North/South Ministerial Council &mdash; Institutional Format</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I have received notice from the Office of the First Minister and  deputy First Minister that the deputy First Minister wishes to make a statement  regarding the North/South Ministerial  Council meeting in institutional format.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. In compliance with  section 52C(2) of the Northern Ireland Act  1998, I wish to make a statement on the meeting of the North/South  Ministerial Council (NSMC) in institutional format that was held in Stormont  Castle, Belfast on 17 December 2007.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Junior Minister Paisley and junior Minister Kelly, who  attended the meeting, have approved this report and I make it on their behalf.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive were represented by junior Minister Paisley,  junior Minister Kelly and myself. The Irish Government were represented by  Dermot Ahern TD, Minister for Foreign Affairs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">At the meeting, the  Council approved the appointment of members to the management boards of  the Trade and Business Development Body, the  North/South Language Body, the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights  Commission, and to the advisory board to the Food Safety Promotion Board,  including chairpersons and vice-chairpersons, with effect from 13 December  2007, and the appointment of a board member  of Foras na Gaelige to serve as vice-chairperson of that body.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council also approved the appointment of the board  members, including the chairperson and vice-chairperson of Tourism Ireland Ltd,  with effect from 19 December 2007.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The joint communiqu&eacute; from the NSMC institutional format  meeting, with a list of new boards, including chairpersons and  vice-chairpersons, was placed in the Assembly Library on 17 December 2007.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The remuneration of chairpersons, vice-chairpersons and  members was also agreed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council thanked outgoing board members and recognised  the key role that they played in developing the North/South bodies and Tourism  Ireland Ltd. They also congratulated the new board members on their  appointments and wished them well in their work. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson of the Committee for the Office of the  First Minister and deputy First Minister (Mr Kennedy)</strong>: I thank the deputy First Minister for his statement.  Although brief, its content is important, and I request on behalf of my Committee  that full details of the list of appointees to the various boards and bodies be  provided.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Moreover, I ask the deputy First Minister and the Office of  the First Minister and deputy First Minister to provide detail on the  background to the appointment process, perhaps indicating how appointments were  arrived at and made. Was any interview process undertaken for any of the  appointments? Were any of them subject to what might be termed &ldquo;political  patronage&rdquo;? I also ask the deputy First Minister to indicate how long each  individual is expected to serve on each body.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The full membership lists of the boards are available. If any  Member does not have a copy to hand, we can furnish him or her with the  information.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The term of service is four years, and it is important to  say that the work to establish those bodies has continued over almost eight  years. Under the Imple&shy;mentation Bodies Agreement of March 1999, the  North/South Ministerial Council appoints management boards to the Trade and  Business Development Body, which operates as InterTradeIreland, the North/South  Language Body, which consists of Foras na Gaelige and the Ulster-Scots Agency,  the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission, and to the advisory board to the Food Safety Promotion  Board.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Overall, the boards of those bodies comprise some 60  members. The Special EU Programmes Body and Waterways Ireland, which is the  inland waterways body, do not have boards. Tourism Ireland Ltd, which was  established as a company that is limited by guarantee, has a board that  comprises 12 directors, who were appointed by the NSMC.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Effectively, the terms  of office of the current members of all the boards, including the  chairpersons and vice-chairpersons, ended in December 2007. Given that most of  them had served two terms, they could not be reappointed. Many of the outgoing  chairpersons, vice-chairpersons and members served on the boards for almost  seven years, and I should add that the members of the outgoing boards made a  sustained commitment to the work of the bodies.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive and the Irish Government made the  appointments to the new boards on a 50:50 basis, and the full list of  membership of all the boards has been placed in the Assembly Library for  Members to access at their own convenience. Those who were appointed to the  boards come from a range of backgrounds and bring with them extensive  experience and knowledge of the business and voluntary sectors.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Essentially, the appointments were made in accordance with  the rules, and we used exactly the same process that David Trimble and S&eacute;amus  Mallon used when they occupied the roles of First Minister and deputy First  Minister.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Moutray</strong>:  Members will have noted Tourism Ireland  Ltd&rsquo;s recent announcement that it will change the way in which it  markets Northern Ireland  so that it reflects aspects of Ulster-Scots heritage and culture, including the  Loyal Orders. Does the deputy First Minister agree that that change will  benefit Northern Ireland  in that more visitors will be attracted here? Was that matter discussed at the  meeting on 17 December 2007?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: That specific issue was not discussed at the meeting. I  appreciate that Tourism <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">Ireland Ltd&rsquo;s  responsibilities include a clear duty to reflect culture and tourism opportunities for the benefit of those in the  international community who are considering whether  to holiday in this part of the world.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For example,  during the Smithsonian event in Washington,   DC, which Ministers from  different parties and I attended, individual  members of the Ancient Order of Hibernians (AOH) objected to the presence of Orange Order  representatives who were explaining the background to their organisation  to the Irish-American community. I came out very strongly against the attitude  of those members of the AOH who were trying  to prevent the Orange Order representatives from describing the Order. I  think that I won the argument, given that I received all sorts of letters of  support from other members of the AOH in the United States of America who  believed that I was absolutely correct. Therefore, it is a good thing, and it  is something that is well worth promoting.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh r&aacute;iteas an  Aire agus roimh an tuairisc. Rinneadh obair th&aacute;bhachtach i rith an chruinnithe  seo i m&iacute; na Nollag.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. Mr Kennedy, in his  capacity as Chairperson of the Committee for the Office of the First Minister  and deputy First Minister, has already asked  several of the questions that I intended to ask. However, will the  deputy First Minister tell me whether the meeting in December concerned itself  in any way with developing further the roles of the North/South implementation  bodies and expanding areas of co-operation?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: All Members know that a review is ongoing to examine objectively  the efficiency and value for money of the existing implementation bodies. That  review will also consider the case for creating additional bodies and areas of  co-operation within the NSMC framework in matters where mutual benefit would be  derived.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The first meeting of the review group took place on 31  October 2007. In addition to senior officials from the Executive and the Irish  Government, the group comprises an advisory panel of four expert advisers, two  of whom were nominated by the Executive and two by the Irish Government.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The group undertook intensive work in November and  December, and a progress report will be made at the NSMC plenary meeting in  February.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I join the deputy First Minister in welcoming the appointment of the new board  members and thanking the outgoing members for their years of service. The deputy First Minister rightly said  that these people have been appointed for four years. Of course, the elephant in the Chamber is the review to  which the deputy First Minister has just referred. We have learnt from  one unionist party this week that its intention is that North/South  developments should not expand and deepen in the next phase of politics on this  island.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Can the deputy First Minister, arising from what Mr  McElduff said, confirm that the review will complete its work by the spring, as  originally intended? When will the Assembly have the opportunity to discuss  fully the review&rsquo;s report and, I hope,  endorse recommendations for a broad extension of areas of co-operation  and implementation on the island   of Ireland?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: It is not my place, with the review ongoing, to pre-empt its  outcome, except to say that it is the very firm intention of the North/South  Ministerial Council that this work should be completed in time for its next  plenary meeting. At this stage, the sensible thing is for all of us to bide our  time. There will be a plenary meeting on 7 February, at which the report will  be considered. Until then, we should allow the review body to get on with its  work.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: The  reconstitution of the five boards is a step forward in the normalisation of  politics. However, even by the standards that we have come to expect from NSMC statements, this one was  remarkably thin. While there was a lot about membership, there was  nothing about achievements or future challenges, even in the context of the review that is under way. Does the  Minister agree that if we are to have these statements on a regular basis &mdash; and  we are obliged to do so under the agreement &mdash; it would be a more productive use of his time and that of the House  to have a bit more substance in them, rather than a mere list of facts  that have already been placed in the Library?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The Member has made his  point, and no doubt the powers that be in the NSMC will consider what he  has said. I agree with him: there are many achievements that we could boast  about regarding the effectiveness of the bodies, which have clearly been  beneficial to both the Irish Government and to us. The Member&rsquo;s point will be  taken on board.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. An estimated 9&middot;1 million visitors  came to the island   of Ireland in 2007, generating  a forecasted &pound;3&middot;1 billion &mdash; equivalent to  &euro;4&middot;6 billion. That represents a 7&middot;5% increase in tourism revenue. Does  the deputy First Minister believe, as I do, that Tourism Ireland Ltd is  delivering sufficiently sustained revenue and visitor growth in the tourism  industry on the island   of Ireland? I hope that  the new chairperson and vice-chairperson will be able to enhance those figures.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: Tourism Ireland Ltd has been a huge success. The figures from the  tourist boards suggest that last year &mdash; sorry, the year before last; I keep  thinking that this is 2007 &mdash; there was a huge increase in the number of  visitors from North   America. That is very  encouraging, and is primarily because of the changed political  circumstances here and the promotional work done by Tourism Ireland Ltd in North America. Tourism Ireland Ltd also has a responsibility  to ensure that that progress continues. All <span style="letter-spacing:-.3pt; ">the indicators from the powers that be in tourism suggest that we are on an  upward trend.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  Following on from what Mr Ford said, and given the standard of previous reports  to the Assembly about such meetings, today&rsquo;s report is extremely brief. I must  ask a question &mdash; and it is a question, Mr Deputy Speaker: is today&rsquo;s report a  full report of what happened at the meeting? If it is, the meeting lasted  around five minutes. I notice that it was held just before the Christmas  recess: was it a case of having a five-minute meeting followed by a two-hour  Christmas lunch at the taxpayers&rsquo; expense, or did more business take place that  has not been reported? If today&rsquo;s report represents all the business that was  carried out at that particular event, then it was not really worth having the  meeting.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: Well, LeasCheann Comhairle, it will not be surprising that I do  not agree with the Member. The meeting was very important as the purpose was to  appoint important boards under the auspices of the North/South Ministerial  Council. The purpose was not to deal with the work of the boards. The meeting  did take a very short time.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  How long did it take?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: It lasted an hour at the most. The cost to the Executive was  approximately &pound;250, and there was no Christmas lunch.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: That is very sad indeed.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I am sure that I will be forgiven for being naive but when the deputy First  Minister refers to the &ldquo;powers that be&rdquo;, I would have thought that he would be  included in that phrase when it comes to directing work programmes for the  Executive and the Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Were there any discussions about the Executive&rsquo;s failure to  establish the Civic Forum, and were any concerns raised by the Irish Government  about the future of the all-Ireland consultative forum?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First Minister</strong>: The Republic   of Ireland&rsquo;s  Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dermot Ahern, did not raise any issue regarding  the consultative forum. I stress again that the sole purpose of the meeting was  to appoint the boards of the NSMC; it was not held for any other purpose.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas  leis an Aire as a r&aacute;iteas.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the deputy First Minister outline whether there will  be proper resources for the boards &mdash; and perhaps enough money for the odd  Christmas lunch?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: We are in danger again.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The NSMC is satisfied that there are enough resources for the  boards. We can be well satisfied that huge progress has been made given the new  political circumstances. We can expect the boards to go from strength to  strength; and as they do, the Irish Government and the Executive will have to  consider whether to put further funding into them. That decision will be taken  jointly by the Irish Government and us.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  In his statement, the deputy First Minister referred to the North/South  Language Body. In Northern    Ireland, promotion of Irish and Ulster Scots  has been completed: what is being done in the South to promote the Ulster-Scots  language? As an Ulster-Scots language enthusiast, I am quite keen to know that  something is being done by the South to promote it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, there has been great disquiet in the unionist  community concerning Tourism Ireland Ltd&rsquo;s ability to deliver for tourism in Northern    Ireland. With the intro<sup>&shy;&shy;</sup>duction  of the new board, my party and the people whom I represent wish to be assured  that Tourism Ireland Ltd can deliver on tourism for the entire Province.  Confidence needs to be restored to the unionist community on that matter.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: During the course of my contribution today, I stated that we, as  an Executive and as members of the NSMC, are satisfied that the work of Tourism  Ireland Ltd is benefiting every section of the community, and that those  appointed to the board will endeavour to continue to ensure that the upward  trend in tourism continues, which is to the benefit of everyone.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">During Executive visits to the United States, we talk  constantly about what the North has to offer and the spectacular scenery in  places such as north Antrim, the Sperrins, County Down, the lakes of Fermanagh,  the streets of the Bogside and the Shankill Road. Tourists from all over the world visit the North to see  those sights.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I listen attentively to radio programmes about Ulster-Scots  issues, and often people from County Donegal and County Monaghan  contribute to those debates. The Ulster-Scots Agency has an office in County Donegal.  Everyone takes Ulster-Scots issues seriously, not least members of the  Executive.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  Will the deputy First Minister inform the House how many North/South  Ministerial Council sectoral meetings have been held during this mandate? When  is the next sectoral meeting due to be held?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First Minister</strong>: The following meetings were held in  sectoral format in 2007: transport on 14 September; inland waterways on 17  October; language on 26 October; environment on 26 October; Special EU  Programmes Body on 7 November; tourism on 8 November; agriculture on 9  November; education on 14 November; Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights  Commission on 21 November; and health and food safety on 28 November. It is anticipated that the meeting in the  trade and business development sectoral format will take place as soon as  possible. The next NSMC plenary meeting is scheduled for 7 February 2008 in Dundalk.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>: I  thank the deputy First Minister for his statement and his ministerial  colleagues for their work on the NSMC meeting in its institutional format.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The deputy First Minister stated that the meeting focused  on appointments to boards. Was the creation of boards for, for example, the  Special EU Programmes Body or Waterways Ireland discussed, or is that issue  being left to the review? If the opportunity did not arise in this instance to  discuss cross-sectoral meetings, for which there is provision, will the deputy  First Minister and his colleagues use February&rsquo;s plenary meeting to set up such  meetings? We have an agenda for innovation and competitiveness, and the South  has established its ambitions in the national development plan, and  cross-sectoral meetings would be useful in progressing that work.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The appointment of boards for the Special EU Programmes Body or  Waterways Ireland was not discussed at the meeting. In my opinion, that issue  is best left to the review. We should consider the establishment of future  cross-sectoral meetings.</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="3"></a>North/South Ministerial Council &mdash; Health and Food  Safety Sectoral Format</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName" style="margin-top:4.95pt;"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: I have received notice from the Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety that he wishes to make a statement on  the North/South Ministerial Council meeting in its health and food safety  sectoral format.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName" style="margin-top:4.95pt;"><strong>The Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr  McGimpsey)</strong>: I wish to make the following statement on the North/South  Ministerial Council meeting in its health and food safety sectoral format. It  took place in Dublin   Castle on Wednesday 28  November 2007. This was the first such meeting since the restoration of the  Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">11.00 am</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText" style="margin-top:4.95pt;">The Executive were represented by  myself, as Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, and by  Michelle Gildernew MP MLA, the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development.  This statement has been endorsed by Minister Gildernew.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText" style="margin-top:4.95pt;">The Irish Government were  represented by Mary Harney TD, Minister for Health and Children. Minister  Harney chaired the meeting, which opened with a progress report on the five  formal areas of co-operation in health, highlighting some of the key  developments since the previous meeting in 2002. Those matters included  co-operation on cancer research; planning for major emergencies; pandemic flu  planning; health promotion; and co-operation on a number of localised  cross-border projects.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText" style="margin-top:4.95pt;">We  also referred to a joint feasibility study, established by my Department  and the Department of Health and Children, which has been tasked with  identifying the potential for a more strategic approach to co-operation in  health and social well-being. That is particularly relevant in view of the  recent and ongoing reorgan&shy;isation and reform programmes in both jurisdictions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText" style="margin-top:4.95pt;">I turn to the current and planned  activities in the aforementioned five areas  of co-operation. The Council received a report on the continuing  co-operation on accident and emergency services. We noted and welcomed two  pilot projects, commissioned by Cooperation and Working Together (CAWT) for a  cross-border GP out-of-hours service.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText" style="margin-top:4.95pt;">Ministers also welcomed ongoing  work involving co-operation on paediatric and congenital cardiac services between the Royal  Victoria Hospital  in Belfast, and Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital for Sick Children in Dublin. We requested that officials report on  the further development of those services at the next sectoral meeting.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council welcomed co-operation on training and planning  for major emergencies. We were briefed on a major  cross-border emergency-planning exercise, which took place in April  2007, and a further emergency-incident exercise, which is planned for 2008. The  close co-operation among the two  Departments and the Health Service Executive on infectious-disease  emergency planning was also welcomed. We noted plans for a possible cross-border exercise on pandemic flu  planning, as part of an EU-wide exercise.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted the high level of co-operation between  the respective fire and rescue services in dealing with emergencies and road  accidents in the border areas. We also agreed that first-responder schemes,  which have been piloted, should be managed by the ambulance services in both  jurisdictions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council considered a report on high-technology equipment, which focused on the provision of  improved access to radiotherapy services. We were pleased to note the  implementation of an agreement among Belfast  City Hospital,  Altnagelvin Hospital  and the Health Service Executive in the Republic to provide cancer patients from County  Donegal with radiotherapy  treatment at Belfast   City Hospital.  It was also agreed that the development of additional radiotherapy capacity  should be progressed in parallel with work on the aforementioned joint  feasibility study, taking into account the scope for further co-operation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the area of cancer research, we received a presentation  from the two Chief Medical Officers &mdash; Dr  Jim Kiely of the Department of Health and Children, and Dr Michael  McBride of the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety (DHSSPS)  &mdash; on the work of the Ireland-Northern Ireland-National Cancer Institute Cancer  Consortium. The Council recognised the successful implementation of programmes  on cancer research, as well as the continuing expanding activity under the  auspices of the consortium. Such activity  includes the development of common protocols, definitions and datasets by cancer registries; the running of a  cancer prevention programme and training workshops for cancer researchers,  doctors, nurses and scientists throughout the island of Ireland and in the USA;  the use of Telesynergy teleconferencing and diagnostic links with the US to aid  the diagnosis of rare conditions and for research collaborations; and the  operation of a cancer clinical trials co-operation group.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council welcomed the broad range of co-operation on  health promotion in key areas, such as tackling obesity, research,  health-promoting hospitals, training, smoking, workplace health promotion,  men&rsquo;s health, mental health and breast feeding. We also noted the work of the  All-Ireland Institute of Public Health, particularly in relation to tackling  health inequalities. We also noted joint working in regard to the promotion of  mental health and, in particular that an all-island suicide prevention action  plan has been developed and agreed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In discussions, we also agreed that aspects of the Internet  played a significant negative role in relation to suicide, and we confirmed  that we would work together to influence change in that area.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the second part of the meeting, we addressed the work of  the Food Safety Promotion Board, which trades under the name Safefood. The  Council received and noted a progress report from Martin Higgins, the CEO of  Safefood. We welcomed the wide range of promotional activities that it had  undertaken and the support given to the food laboratory sector over the past  five years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted the plans for Safefood for 2008-10. The  plans included the rolling out of five major consumer information campaigns;  the delivery of a joined-up approach to food safety and healthy eating in  partnership with sponsor Departments, other food safety bodies and other  responsible agencies; the establishment of a collaborative forum to tackle  obesity; and the development and maintenance of in-house knowledge and  expertise to reliably interpret the scientific evidence to inform its  activities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We approved the Safefood corporate plan for 2008-10 and  business plan for 2008, subject to the agreement of the respective finance  Departments, as well as the budgetary considerations by the Executive and the Irish Government. The Council noted  Safefood&rsquo;s annual report and accounts for 2006, which will be laid  before the Assembly soon.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We also considered a proposal from Safefood on enteric  reference services &mdash; expert analysis, inter&shy;pretation,  advice and samples related to diseases affecting the gastrointestinal  tract &mdash; for the island   of Ireland. The proposal  summarises possible options regarding the provision of enteric reference  laboratory services to meet the needs of  service users in both jurisdictions and to further enhance public health. Following consideration of the paper by experts and the two sponsor  Departments, a report will be brought to a future sectoral meeting. The  Council agreed to meet in the health and food safety sectoral format in spring  2008.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mrs I Robinson)</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. As he knows, the Committee for Health,  Social Services and Public Safety is undertaking an inquiry into the prevention of suicide and self-harm in Northern Ireland,  and I note that the Minister referred to the development of an all-island  suicide prevention action plan. Can the Minister provide any further update on  the action plan, and inform us of whether  it includes any specific targets?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  Members are aware that there is a strategy to counter suicide in Northern Ireland.  The Republic of Ireland also has a strategy to deal with  suicide in the Twenty-six Counties. The all-island action plan looks at ways  that the two plans can work together; for example, by keeping each jurisdiction  informed of the other&rsquo;s strategy, as well as sharing information and good  practice.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">No specific action has  been devised that can prevent suicide, and, therefore, each jurisdiction  is developing menus and sharing good practice. As part of this joint strategy,  a representative from the Irish Republic attends the meetings of the strategic  implementation body in Northern    Ireland and shares this information with our  counterparts in the South.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We also have an all-island public information campaign  known as &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Me&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Box&rdquo;. This involves adverts running in the North  and the South as part of a campaign to promote good mental health and to  counter suicide. As part of this, we also have the five nations working group,  which involves the sharing of good practice as well as discussing the harm  being done by the Internet in this area.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, although there are action plans in both Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic,  the all-island action plan is about seeing how the two can complement each  other.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as ucht a r&aacute;itis.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister may know that I take a particular interest in  the two pilot projects, com&shy;missioned by Cooperation and Working Together, for  cross-border GP out-of-hours services. I understand that those projects are in  the Derry/Inishowen and Keady/Crossmaglen/Castleblayney areas. Will the  Minister tell the House whether any consideration is being given to further  expanding that necessary cross-border service? There is a perfectly good  out-of-hours health centre in Strabane, for example, that can benefit people  living one mile away in Lifford and who instead are being encouraged to go to  Letterkenny, 15 miles away. That would be a practical outworking of a necessary  project, and I would like to see it expanded into the Lifford/Strabane area  and, indeed, to other areas along the border. It makes sense to have a seamless  provision of health services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister also  comment on the implementation of the agreement between Belfast City  Hospital, Altnagelvin  Hospital and the Health Service  Executive to provide cancer patients from Donegal with radiotherapy treatment at Belfast   City Hospital?  Is there a move to provide services either at Altnagelvin or Letterkenny for the benefit of people in the  north-west?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>: Cooperation and Working Together &mdash; an organisation that,  through funding from the EU, examines marginalisation in border areas &mdash; is  looking at GP out-of-hours services. A pilot project has just been completed in  the Londonderry/Letterkenny area and is being evaluated. Another pilot has been launched in the Keady/Castleblayney area.  Once those pilots have been completed and the evaluations carried out,  we will be in a position to determine how we should respond. If there is good  practice and the need is there, that will inform our response.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to the arrangements for radiotherapy treatment,  cancer patients from Donegal can access the service at the cancer centre in Belfast City Hospital.  That has been agreed between my Department and the Department of Health and  Children in the Republic. Approximately 50 patients a year from Donegal use  that service. As Members will be aware, the cancer centre in Belfast will have reached capacity by 2015.  There are eight radiotherapy machines at present, and the facility can take two  more before it reaches capacity. The question then is how do we expand after  that &mdash; and that is looking purely at Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">One of the suggested options is to develop a subregional  centre at Altnagelvin, which would work closely with, and be integrated with, Belfast City Hospital.  That raises the question, which the Dublin  Government have asked, of whether the capacity could be built in to allow  patients from Donegal to access the service. The Republic would pay for the  capacity and for its patients to access it.  It is an ongoing programme, and I am discussing the matter with Mary  Harney. The planning has to start now because it will take from now to 2015 to  get everything in place.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert  Coulter</strong>: I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement, particularly the reference to  the activities of the Food Safety Promotion Board. Will the Minister give  Members some enlightenment on the work of the board in connection with the use  of pesticides in food that is grown in both sections of our country? Will he  also tell us whether any tribute was paid to Mr Bertie Kerr, who for eight  years was chairman of the Food Safety Promotion Board? There should be some  recognition of the excellent work that he did in leading the board from its  inception to the present time.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  We paid tribute to Bertie Kerr at the meeting. He has been in post for nine  years, and he did not expect to be doing the job for that long when he took up  office. He has worked very hard and diligently and has been a strong promoter  of the work of the Food Safety Promotion Board.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Pesticides and food form part of the remit of the Food  Safety Promotion Board, which aims to ensure that  food safety is promoted and that food is not polluted by pesticides, for  example. The board is keeping a very close watch on that issue, and it keeps up  to date on best practice in other areas of the UK  and Europe. That is why the Food Safety Promotion Board is an important body that  does important work, and why it has been one of the most non-contentious areas  of cross-border co-operation from its inception. I believe that it will go from  strength to strength.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. I welcome the number of areas on which  work is being undertaken. Although I have my own contact with our opposite  numbers on the Committee on Health and Children in the Republic, I would  welcome more detail and feedback on those matters.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister&rsquo;s statement addressed the challenge of  lifestyles. Will the Minister inform the House whether alcohol abuse, binge  drinking and the associated problems, such as family breakdown and attacks on  health staff, were mentioned during discussions?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  I take Mrs Hanna&rsquo;s point about information, and, of course, I am happy to  undertake to provide whatever information that I can.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This was our first meeting since restoration, but health  promotion and alcohol abuse will certainly form part of our discussions &mdash; as  will suicide prevention, which was raised by Mrs Robinson, and the other  lifestyle issues with which we are familiar, such as obesity and family  breakdown, which were discussed, although only in general terms, at the  meeting. I have no doubt that we will rise to the task ahead.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Deeny</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. I am pleased to hear that the first  health and food safety sectoral meeting has taken place. That is important for  all of us, particularly those of us who live in the border counties.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I concur with my West Tyrone colleague Barry McElduff, and  I encourage the Minister and his counterpart in the South to continue with the  GP out-of-hours centres on either side of the border so that it will not matter  where one falls sick, because a patient will be seen in the most convenient GP  centre.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">One of the five areas  that the Minister mentioned is emergency care, which I have been talking  about for some time. Do the Minister and his counterpart recognise that when  planning for major emergencies, the roads that offer access to accident and  emergency departments play a major role? On the north-west road from Dublin, there is not one  accident and emergency department. Since the closure of the Omagh and Monaghan  hospitals, there is also no accident and emergency department on the N2 from Dublin, which becomes the  A5 at Aughnacloy. There is no provision until one reaches Derry,  where there is an accident and emergency department at Altnagelvin. There is  another at Letterkenny.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That is a major road of about 175 miles that is  increasingly used by many people on the island  of Ireland to travel between Dublin and the north-west  &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Dr Deeny, please ask your question.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Deeny</strong>: Is  the Minister, or his counterpart in the South, Mary Harney, not aware of the  glaring absence of an accident and emergency department on a major route from Dublin to the north west of the island of Ireland?  What happens if a major incident occurs on that road? That is a glaring  deficiency in emergency medical care. Has no one, North or South, been made  aware of that?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  Dr Deeny will be aware that the one-hour rule operates in Northern Ireland.  Therefore, everyone living in Northern    Ireland is within one hour of an accident  and emergency department, and it is my responsibility to deliver on that rule.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Discussions have taken place and operations are under way  on cross-border planning for major emergencies. For example, last year &ldquo;Exercise Medical Bridge&rdquo;  required ambulance services, military personnel and police from both  jurisdictions to work together in response to a supposed major medical  incident. We are also examining co-operation on a possible pandemic flu  outbreak in the UK, on the island of Ireland  and in Europe, as such outbreaks are not only  regional: they can be on a national and international scale.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We are reviewing fire and ambulance services in border  areas, in particular the first responder scheme. We are also looking at road  traffic accident hot spots and how emergency services can respond and deliver support  and medical assistance as and when it is necessary.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Twelve Members are still on the list to ask questions. I ask  Members to be brief when asking their questions.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  Although the matter has already been referred to, will the Minister tell me who  will be responsible for funding radiotherapy treatment for patients from County Donegal?  Will he confirm that cancer patients in Northern Ireland will neither lose  out nor be placed on longer waiting lists as a result of the agreement? Will he  inform the House of the current waiting times for patients in Northern Ireland  requiring that treatment?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  There are no waiting times for radiotherapy treatment: patients are seen  immediately. As Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, my  responsibility is to deliver services for the people of Northern Ireland.  As capacity in the radio&shy;therapy centre in Belfast City   Hospital will be outgrown  by 2015, I, as Minister, through the Depart&shy;ment  and with support from the House and the Executive, will plan for the  delivery of an increase in services. My preference is for services at Altnagelvin Hospital,  which will also benefit cross-border patients in County Donegal.  The Dublin Government are also making that point  and will pay for any extra capacity required and any usage by people in the Irish Republic.  However, my first responsibility is to  patients in Northern Ireland,  and my planning for 2015 will take that on board.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as a r&aacute;iteas.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to the Minister&rsquo;s response to the previous  question, is there any possibility that a new centre could be up and running  before full capacity is reached in 2015, and that it would be at Altnagelvin Hospital, as the Minister has already  indicated?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  That is clearly a possibility. We are looking at that as well as expanding  services in Belfast.  There are problems with people having to travel from areas such as Londonderry  and Coleraine to Belfast  for radiotherapy treatment. The question is whether capacity should be placed  outside Belfast City Hospital  while continuing to work closely with the hospital? Altnagelvin Hospital,  as a sub-regional hospital, is one of the preferred options. The decision must  be made and the capacity must be in place by 2015, and Altnagelvin Hospital  is a possibility.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  Will the Minister outline the possible cost  for Northern Ireland  of the safefood corporate plan?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>: There will be a 2:5 split in the cost. The cost of running the  body was around &pound;7 million per annum, which will translate to &pound;2 million for Northern Ireland and &pound;5 million for the Irish Republic,  approximately.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The new budget for that body has not been agreed. Our share  must first be agreed by the Executive, followed by the Minister of Finance and  Personnel and the Department of Finance and Personnel; however, it will be of  that order of magnitude.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>: I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement, and I also wish to be  associated with the remarks about Bertie Kerr and his excellent work over the  eight or nine years that he has been involved with the Food Safety Promotion  Board.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I particularly welcome cross-border co-operation in emergency planning, and the Minister&rsquo;s earlier  response about new developments at Altnagelvin will be welcomed by residents in that area. What  developments in such co-operation does the Minister envisage,  particularly for the new Erne Hospital and &mdash; closer to home for me &mdash;Daisy Hill   Hospital? Does the  Minister consider the North/South co-operation between Daisy Hill and County Louth  in the treatment of patients to be a way forward in the delivery of good  quality services in rural areas in Northern Ireland?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  The decision to provide acute services in the new Erne  Hospital was based purely on the needs  of people in Northern    Ireland &mdash; specifically, in the south-west. That was the limit of my  responsibility; however, there are possibilities for cross-border co-operation in instances of mutual benefit to the  people of Northern Ireland  and those in the Irish   Republic, which are the  responsibility of the Republic&rsquo;s Minister for Health and Children, Mary Harney.  The same principle also applies to Daisy   Hill Hospital.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement and his ministerial colleagues for their  work in the sectoral meeting. In the short time available, it is difficult to  do justice to such an extensive agenda. Therefore, I hope that the Minister  will be sufficiently encouraged by Members&rsquo; interest in these matters to hold  the next sectoral meeting in early, rather than late, spring in order that we might hear more about progress.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want the Minister to address two areas. He has covered  the first in his answers to other questions, and he will not be surprised to  hear that that concerns the provision of cancer services. The development of  radiotherapy services at Altnagelvin should not be considered merely as an  issue for the north-west, any more than  other investment in the cancer strategy should be considered as a  geographical issue &mdash; including the previous Executive&rsquo;s investment in the  cancer centre at Belfast   City Hospital.  I hope that the Minister will work with Mary Harney to secure funding to make  that a reality sooner rather than later, possibly utilising some of the  unallocated reserves in the South&rsquo;s national development plan.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, the Minister spoke of possible cross-border plans  to tackle pandemic flu as part of an EU-wide exercise. Will he tell us more  about that, and do such plans depend on close-to-home or EU issues?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  I have nothing further to add to what I have said about cancer services and the  need to plan for increased capacity.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We are discussing the possibility of holding regular  meetings about pandemic flu to address issues relating to communication, vaccination,  and so on. As Northern Ireland  is the only area of the UK  with a land border with a country outside the UK,  those meetings will be relevant to the UK  and the island of   Ireland. In addition,  such plans must also be integrated with EU policies. Questions will arise about  the various governmental responses during such an outbreak, the importance of a  common message to our respective populations and common planning for air  travel, and so on. Those are the areas that we are discussing, and we are part  of the UK-wide response strategy, into which the Government in the Irish Republic  will feed &mdash; all of which will feed into the EU as a whole.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. T&aacute; ceist agam don Aire. I have a  question for the Minister. I welcome his statement, and thank him especially  for information on the GP out-of-hours service in the Keady, Castleblayney and  Crossmaglen areas. Sadly, the Minister made no mention of the proposed North/South interconnector and the  400-kilovolt overhead cable that will pass through County Armagh.  What consultation has he had with other Ministers here and with his counterpart  in the South about allaying people&rsquo;s fears and public perceptions about the  health implications of the interconnector?  Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>: The provision of the interconnector is out of my hands. It is  not the responsibility of Health Departments,  North or South; the responsibility is wider. When a decision is made,  and when I know what that decision is, I will examine the health implications.  However, evidence of such implications is varied.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  In his statement, the Minister referred to:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;continuing  co-operation on accident and emergency services.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A helicopter service is one method of response to accident  and emergency situations. Has consideration been given to providing a  helicopter service on a North/South basis? I ask that question, because I am  aware of a group called Alpha 5, which is very keen that the emergency services  in Northern Ireland  should have a helicopter. Bearing in mind that a helicopter can respond more quickly than an ambulance to emergencies  on land or at sea, and that road congestion  was mentioned earlier, it is vitally important for responding to  emergencies, and I ask the Minister to consider it.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  There have been preliminary discussions  about an accident-and-emergency helicopter service. The provision of a  helicopter is one issue; the provision of its crew is another. Providing a  skilled, trained crew would have revenue consequences. I do not have resources  for that in my budget, nor have I bid for them. The idea has been raised, and I  have had preliminary discussions about it. I agree that an e<span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt; ">mergency helicopter would add greatly to response  times and would be a major help to the Ambulance Service in dealing with  accident and emergency situations.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. F&aacute;ilt&iacute;m roimh r&aacute;iteas an Aire  faoi ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; sl&aacute;inte agus ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; comhoibrithe Thuaidh/Theas.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement on co-operation in  various North/South health matters. I am sure that he is aware of the recent  report from the Centre for Cross Border Studies entitled &lsquo;Removing the  Barriers: An Initial Report on the Potential for Greater Cross-Border  Co-operation in Hospital Services in Ireland&rsquo;. One of the proposals in  the report refers to a previous report &mdash; the Teamwork Report &mdash; and the  possibility of a major hospital being sited north of Dublin  that would also serve south Down and south Armagh.  The Centre for Cross Border Studies report also refers to the potential of such  a project and its implications for Daisy   Hill Hospital  in Newry.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister assure the House that, in any future  discussion that he might have on the issue, he will ensure that the status of Daisy Hill   Hospital in Newry and its  range of services will be defended and maintained in the context of future  North/South co-operation?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  I have not discussed the Dublin Government&rsquo;s provision of a new hospital in  Louth; that is Mary Harney&rsquo;s responsibility. As Minister for Health and  Children, she must provide for the people who live within her jurisdiction. My  responsibility lies north of the border, and Daisy Hill Hospital plays a key role in the  provision of services in Newry and south Down.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, it is not a matter for me; it is a matter for  the Dublin Government, which will make their decisions known in due course. It  is no secret that Dundalk and Drogheda are  being discussed as possible venues for the new hospital.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  statement. I welcome the work that is being carried out by the Food Safety  Promotion Board. Does the Minister agree that the procurement of local produce  is essential to the health and well-being of patients in our hospitals,  particularly seasonal foods, local meat, chicken and organic produce? Go raibh  maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  I wholeheartedly agree with the remarks on the procurement of local produce;  that is important. Too often, people buy what appears to be the cheapest  option, but, in the long run, as we are now aware, it ends up being more  expensive. That is particularly the case when taking into account the carbon  footprint that results from buying some foods from supermarkets. Local produce  is available, and it is every bit as good and nutritious as supermarket  products. Moreover, in the long term, local produce is not as harmful as far as  the planet is concerned.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Adams</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister and commend him  on many of the practical steps that he has outlined. My question is about the  promotion of good mental health and suicide prevention. I noted the answer that  was given to the Chairperson of the Health Committee when she asked about  targets. The answer did not make it clear what those targets are. The Minister  stated that: &ldquo;an all-island suicide prevention action plan has been developed  and agreed.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Is it possible  for Members to see the details of that plan?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>: There is a close working  relationship between Northern Ireland  and the Irish Republic on the issue of suicide  prevention. The Member is aware that we have a suicide prevention action plan  in Northern Ireland.  The action plan is managed by an implemen&shy;tation body, which is chaired by Colm  Donaghy. That body includes interested parties, including bereaved families.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We share best practice and are holding ongoing discussions  with the Irish Republic, which is facing similar  challenges. Discussions are also ongoing with our counterparts in England, Scotland  and Wales.  I am happy to share any detail that I have because it is important that we get  the message out as best we can. Therefore, I am happy to write to the Member.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading"><a name="4"></a>December Monitoring Outcome</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I have received notice from the  Minister of Finance and Personnel that he wishes to make a statement on the December monitoring outcome.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr P Robinson)</strong>: The following statement regarding on  spending in 2007-08 after the conclusion of the December monitoring round is  made on behalf of the Executive. The December round is the third of the 2007-08  financial year. Members will by now be well aware of the role and purpose of  the in-year process. It is, in simple terms, intended to help the Executive to make  the most of the resources at their disposal. The first stage in that process is  the identification by Departments of resources allocated in previous Budget  processes, which, for a variety of reasons, will not be spent in the financial  year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In overview, reduced requirements declared by Departments  in the monitoring round amount to &pound;107&middot;4 million in respect of current  expenditure, and &pound;132&middot;3 million in respect of capital investment. The level of  reduced requirements declared in the round is much greater than the levels that  were identified at the corresponding time in previous years, and the amount  declared to date for this financial year is some 12% greater than the totality  of all reduced requirements that were declared last year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That position firmly indicates that Departments have  robustly reviewed their in-year financial position and have sought to declare  reduced requirements at a time when the Executive can make best use of those  resources, rather than simply allowing the amounts to fall as year-end  underspend, as has often been the case in the past.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That robust assessment of in-year requirements also  indicates that my Executive colleagues are working to improve the level and  quality of financial management in Departments. I commend them and encourage  them to build on that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I cannot overstate the importance of embedding the highest standards of financial management in the  public sector. In that context, I am grateful to the Committee for  Finance and Personnel for the valuable and positive contribution it made to the issue last week, as part of its  response to the draft Budget. I look forward to working closely with the  Committee on that issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, although acknowledging the improving position on  reduced requirements, I must also register a note of caution regarding another  aspect of financial management &mdash; particularly in the context of the parallel  Budget process. It must be recognised that the amounts identified as reduced  requirements in this monitoring round represent allocations that were made to  Departments in previous Budget processes in response to bids from those  Departments. Although I recognise that some of that reduced need may have  arisen as a consequence of greater-than-planned efficiency in Departments, the  more significant factors are that Departments overstated their original  resource needs or have not delivered the planned level of public services  underpinning those Budget bids.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members, and my colleagues in the Executive, will agree  that neither of the above situations is acceptable, and I must bear that in  mind as we consider the final Budget proposals for the next three years. It  will take the form of a robust challenge to, and scrutiny of, departmental  spending proposals while seeking to develop further a culture of delivery, with  appropriate mechanisms to monitor and drive performance. Details of all of the  reduced requirements declared by Departments are set out in Table 1 of my  statement. Against that level of reduced requirements, Departments have  submitted current expenditure bids of &pound;82 million and capital investment bids  amounting to &pound;134&middot;5 million.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I now turn to the position regarding current expenditure.  The Executive are in a position, uniquely, to address all of the bids that have  been submitted by Departments. I do not propose to explain each bid in detail;  however, this monitoring round has allowed significant resources to be  allocated to priority services such as education, health and regional  development, while addressing other important issues raised by Departments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For the Department of Education, the main component of its  &pound;15&middot;3 million allocation will allow it to meet the additional costs, some &pound;12  million, arising from the classroom assistants&rsquo; dispute. The allocation of &pound;17  million to the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety will  allow it to allocate &pound;14 million towards addressing costs associated with the  review of public administration, which would otherwise fall to be met during  the Budget period. That allocation will remove the need for the Department,  over the Budget period, to divert resources away from other areas to address  the RPA pressure.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For the Department for Regional Development, additional  resources of &pound;28&middot;5 million will allow it to address a number of issues, most  notably, the ongoing costs of the water Go-co and investment in roads  structural maintenance.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">With respect to capital investment, the Executive have  agreed to allocate &pound;74&middot;1 million to Departments. That sum includes &pound;22&middot;7  million to the Department for Regional Development to meet the increased land  costs associated with the A1 Beech Hill to Cloghogue road scheme and to enable  completion of the Newry to Dundalk road scheme.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Almost &pound;50 million has been allocated to the Department for  Social Development for a range of social housing initiatives, including the  co-ownership scheme, the warm homes scheme  and the social housing development programme. That money will enable the  Department to achieve its target of starting 1,500 new social houses this year,  and, under the co-ownership scheme, assist 525 applicants into home ownership.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The consequence of the  level of reduced requirements and bids met is that, for current  expenditure, the level of planned over-commitment is now &pound;63&middot;5 million.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That is in line with the Department&rsquo;s target of &pound;50 million  at the conclusion of the February 2008 monitoring round and represents  satisfactory progress in the management of that key issue.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to capital investment, there are now unallocated resources of some &pound;57 million. That  reflects the fact that many  Departments have identified slippage in planned projects and the simple  reality that it is difficult to accelerate other capitals projects in order to  consume those resources at a relatively late stage in the financial year. That  position emphasises the point that I have made about the need for continued  improvements in financial and, indeed, project management. All unspent  resources will continue to be available for carry forward for the Executive&rsquo;s  use in the future. The final opportunity to review the in-year position will be  February 2008. However, the February monitoring round offers limited  opportunity to address issues due to the timing of the round and the  constraints imposed by the spring Supplementary Estimates position.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, therefore, I reiterate the good work that  Departments have done to robustly assess their in-year requirements. I am  confident that through that &mdash; aligned with my Department&rsquo;s ongoing work to  improve the level and quality of financial management across all Departments &mdash;  we will see better financial performance at all levels in those Departments. I  commend the December monitoring position to the Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel  (Mr McLaughlin)</strong>: Go raibh maith  agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. It is  a positive outcome. I extend my congratulations to all concerned.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The fact that the Minister is in a position to meet all  bids shows that Ministers have responded to the general encouragement,  supported by their respective scrutiny Committees, to ensure that capital and  resource bids are realistically maxed to capacity and the ability to deploy and  use those financial resources. Locally elected Ministers have clearly  demonstrated that they have taken a sustainable and robust approach to the  matter. I support the Minister&rsquo;s comments on that improvement and the need for  it to continue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On Monday 25 June 2007, during his statement on the June  monitoring round, the Minister stated that:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The optimum would be to reduce the underspend to  close to 1%.&rdquo; &mdash; <span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official  Report, Vol 23, No 1 p 4, col 1].</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Committee for Finance and Personnel has made  recommendations on that as part of its recent report on the draft Budget. How  confident is the Minister that that can be achieved for 2007-08? What actions  are his officials taking towards that?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I welcome the Committee Chairperson&rsquo;s remarks. Although one swallow does not  make a summer, the evidence shows that the devolved Ministers have been more  focused and have kept their eye on the ball. They have recognised that for the  money to be of value to the whole of Northern Ireland, it is necessary  to identify any reduced requirements as early as possible. The fact that that  is the highest level that there has been at this point in the year, and that  all the bids have been met, indicates that Ministers have done the job that the  Assembly, during previous debates, quite rightly directed their attention  towards.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to the goal of an underspend that is close to  1%, all that my departmental officials can do is examine the evidence that they  receive from officials in other Departments, which they monitor regularly. If  the information that my Department has received from other Departments is accurate,  that target should be realised. Of course, that will require Ministers and  their officials to continue to monitor closely any prospective reduced  requirement so that it can be used in February 2008, so that we do not end up  with a massive underspend at the end of the year and will not have to go  through the ordeal of having to bid it back from Treasury.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel (Mr Storey)</strong>: I  welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. In particular, I welcome his comments about  the Committee&rsquo;s work, which he said was helpful, valuable and positive. The  Committee&rsquo;s report on the draft Budget  emphasised the importance of regular Statutory Committee scrutiny of the  monitoring process and, in particular, the need for Departments to provide  Committees with the necessary information in a timely and accessible manner.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister confirm that there is a standard format  for departmental monitoring submissions to the Department of Finance and  Personnel? Moreover, will the Minister comment on the possibility of his  officials working with all Departments to agree a standard format for providing  Committees with financial information to meet their needs?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I thank the Deputy Chairman of the Committee for Finance and Personnel for his  comments. There has consistently been, in the early stage of each financial  year, a process whereby my officials have issued guidance to each Department on  setting out the timetable for the in-year monitoring process and required  inputs from each of those Depart&shy;ments. I, of course, would be happy for my  officials to work with Departments &mdash; and, indeed, the Committee for Finance and  Personnel &mdash; to develop a standard approach to facilitate Committee  considerations and scrutiny of those inputs into that important process.  Therefore, I support the comments of the Deputy Chairman of the Committee for  Finance and Personnel.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s assessment that his colleagues are  working to improve the level and quality of financial management in their  Departments. It is important that the block grant is not returned to the  Treasury at the end of the year and that it is put to good use in Northern Ireland.  Is the Minister confident that no moneys will be returned to the Treasury at the  end of the year and that moneys will have  been usefully allocated and accounted for?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I notice that, in respect of the review of non-cash  requirements, the largest single item &mdash; that of &pound;17&middot;9 million &mdash; was returned by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment. As the term &ldquo;non-cash require&shy;ments&rdquo; does not provide much  information, will the Minister provide some additional information about that  matter? Is the Minister confident that the areas of increased expenditure that  were included in the draft Budget can be  effectively managed to indicate confidence in its future management?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  If I heard the Member correctly, he asked &mdash; in the early part of his question &mdash;  whether I could offer some type of guarantee  that no money would be handed back to the Treasury. There will never be  a year when no money will be held back,  unless a disaster occurs and we  overspend. The sanctions for overspending are much greater than those  for underspending. If we underspend, we can bid to have those moneys returned  to us. We must ensure that as little money as possible is returned to the  Treasury as a result of underspending and make certain that we get that money  back by ensuring that we have EYF from the Treasury on a planned basis. We have  managed to do that for the next three years as part of the Budget process.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member for East Antrim  made particular reference to the &pound;17&middot;9 million that was returned by the  Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment. My Department has carried out a  review of non-cash requirements that  resulted in reduced requirements with regard to provisions, impairments  and cost of capital in a number of business areas. There is a sum of &pound;5&middot;5  million of non-cash easement from Invest Northern Ireland; &pound;5&middot;9 million from central  administration; &pound;6&middot;4 million from Harland and Wolff&rsquo;s asbestosis provision; and  &pound;300,000 from depreciation reduction.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I too welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. I particularly note the &pound;49&middot;7 million  that has been allocated to the Department for Social Develop&shy;ment, which will permit the completion of 1,500  homes. I particularly welcome that allocation because extra money was  given to that Department in the October monitoring round.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That should enable the Department to reach its target, and  that is to be welcomed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As the Minister will probably be aware, the warm homes  scheme is oversubscribed, and the allocation will help to ease the pressure.  Furthermore, it will also be of great assistance to the co-ownership scheme. In  effect, the co-ownership scheme pays for itself in that receipts go back to the  Department of Finance and Personnel. The statement is good news.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Mr Maginness, will you come to the question, please?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Maginness</strong>:  I hope that the Minister will be equally generous to the Department in the  forthcoming Budget by increasing the funding to areas where it is most needed &mdash;  in particular, social housing, so that the target of starting to build at least  1,500 social houses can be met.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I do not mind the Member going on at length if he is making supportive  comments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that the allocations that have been made, in the  October monitoring round and in this monitoring round, confirm the priority  that the Executive have, as a whole, given to social housing. We are all aware  of the growing waiting lists and the need for social housing. The Executive  have made this issue a priority in the  draft Programme for Government, the Investment Strategy for Northern Ireland  and the draft Budget. The targets are there, and they are there to be met. I am  glad that this allocation will allow the Minister for Social Development to  achieve the kind of figures that Mr Maginness has outlined. In addition to the  figure allocated for social housing, there is also the benefit from  co-ownership for affordable housing.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that Mr Maginness will recognise that the priorities  that have been set in the monitoring rounds indicate the kind of priorities  that the Executive will set in the Budget. He will have to wait for only a very  short period for that, and I hope that he will find that this monitoring round  is a harbinger of the Budget.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: I remind Members to be brief. I know that all Ministers love to hear flattering  comments, but 11 Members still have to speak, and I have no guarantee  that all their remarks will be flattering. I call Mr Ford from the long list of  Members in front of me.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  He is never flattering.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I take that endorsement from the Chair with  enthusiasm.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister for the statement, and, in purely  financial terms, it recognises significant achievement this year. However, the  Minister has outlined three possible reasons for the release of funding:  greater than planned efficiency in Departments &mdash; which he appears to think is  the least important factor; the overstating of resource needs by Departments;  and the fact that Departments have not delivered the planned level of public  services. Given that every other debate in the Chamber concerns the need for an  increased level of public services, will  the Minister give Members an assessment of what he thinks the balance is  between the two key factors? Is it more a  case of the overstatement of requirements or of failure to meet planned  needs? In particular, does he recognise that it is clear from Committee reports that a significant increase in  the level of public services is  required across a range of services?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>: The Member should firstly recognise that the role of an  opposition politician &mdash; and he very much tries to mould himself as the Leader  of the Opposition &mdash; is not always to oppose; at times, it is to support. He  should perhaps take a lesson out of the playbook of David Cameron, who  recognises that, at times, he has to support the Government in their plans. He  does not always have to introduce &ldquo;however&rdquo; into his remarks.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My statement is a good-news statement. We must recognise  that Ministers have been operating under a direct rule Budget. The expenditure  that Ministers have been given is not what they determined to be the  appropriate expenditure. They are working off the figures produced under direct  rule, which obviously will change when we have our own Budget.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">12.00 noon</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We do look for greater efficiency, and it is obvious that  we want the highest level of public services that our resources allow &mdash; I made  that point in my statement. Indeed, there are indications that there was too  much fat in certain areas of that Budget. However, the Member will note that with regard to the allocations that I  have made, in virtually every case in which Ministers gave money back to the  centre, I gave it back to them for another purpose, so that they could use it  for their own departmental priorities.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  wonder whether the leader of the Alliance Party models himself more on Ming  Campbell than David Cameron.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Look what happened to him.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  will not waste time by lavishing praise on the Minister&rsquo;s excellent statement.  He has made a significant announcement on capital allocation of more than &pound;49  million to the Department for Social Development. Will he tell the House what  the total allocation for social housing has been in this year&rsquo;s monitoring rounds and what signal that sends out  about the priority he attaches to that area of expenditure?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  My best recollection is that approximately  &pound;23 million was allocated in the October monitoring round. The Member  can quickly do the mathematics for himself by adding on the amount allocated in  the December monitoring round. As a rule of thumb, &pound;100,000 is usually  equivalent to one new housing start &mdash; and the Member can do the maths again.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In considering social housing, or many other areas of need,  it is clear that what cannot be achieved through the Budget process can often  be augmented by the in-year monitoring  process &mdash; and while that cannot be  factored in at the initial stage, it is always of assistance to us in  meeting the targets that we have set. However, as far as social housing is  concerned, I repeat the commitment that I made to the House when I told the  leader of the SDLP that I was a signed-up member of Margaret Ritchie&rsquo;s club as  regards obtaining the funds for the Department for Social Development. I also  said that we would examine the work of the capital realisation task force in  order to augment the draft Budget statement by the time the Budget is  presented.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>: A LeasCheann Comhairle, I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s allocation of  an additional &pound;73 million to the Department for Social Development for social  housing, the warm homes scheme and co-ownership in the October and December  monitoring rounds. Consid&shy;erable additional  investment will be required over many years if we are to deal  effectively with the shortage of affordable social housing and the mess that  was left by direct rule Ministers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department for Social Development and the Housing  Executive have said that no new houses will be built next year. Given that dire  prediction, will the Minister comment on the impact that the Department for  Social Development&rsquo;s &pound;18&middot;6 million underspend will have on the social housing  newbuild programme?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  Let me be clear. I would be very disappointed if having allocated tens of  millions to a Department it could not build new houses with that money. I had a  discussion with the Minister for Social Development yesterday on whether to  calculate the number of houses built on the basis of starts or completions.  That is an issue that the Executive must consider also.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The man or woman in the street would prefer that houses are  built and that people move in, rather than being  told that allocations have been made or that tender agreements have been  signed. To me, completions are much more important overall. The targets that  were set in the draft Programme for  Government, the investment strategy  and the draft Budget were based on completions: perhaps we can move in  that direction.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The target of 2,000 affordable social houses each year has  been set. I believe that it is a minimum target, which, if possible, I would  like to exceed. Although some &ldquo;cranking-up&rdquo; may need to be done to get to that  level, the target has been set by the Executive, and that is what the Executive  will be judged by.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, it will be up to the Executive as a whole to  ensure that the resources are there. It will be up to the Minister to deliver  on the ground. We will all be judged on the basis of whether we meet those  targets.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  There has been much concentration on, and concern expressed about, the legacy  of the level of overcommitment that has been inherited from direct rule. Will  the Minister explain what consequence the improving financial management that  he spoke of in his statement has for the setting of the level of overcommitment  in the Budget?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  In response to the Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel, I  said that one swallow does not necessarily mean that we are entering summer,  and the current situation does not indicate that we are. If that trend were to  continue, there would be a lower level of underspend at the end of the year.  Therefore, in the draft Budget, we have been  prudent in reducing the degree of overcommitment. We have taken the right steps, and we must be  cautious. We will know more clearly at the February monitoring round and  at the end of the financial year whether that trend has continued. I predict  that the reason that the Executive have managed to achieve a larger level of  underspend in the early part of the financial year is because the devolved Ministers have focused on the issue.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>: I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement, and I welcome the money for  the investment in roads structural maintenance. Maintenance of our roads has been underfunded, so the investment is welcome. I  also welcome the money for the Beech Hill to Cloghogue part of the A1  scheme. The Minister will, of course, be aware that the rising costs of that  scheme are the consequence of increased land values. In the need to improve the  project management, what measures has he taken to ensure that that does not  happen again?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  It will be a matter for the Minister for Regional Development to make the  appropriate judgement on the likely costs, and his officials will do that. No  Minister could be blamed for the variable land costs, which have increased  significantly over the past few years. Particularly over the past year, land  and property prices have increased significantly and neither the Minister nor  his officials could have predicted that level  of increase. However, it is not the current Minister who is responsible  because the figures were set much earlier, during the period of direct rule.  The trends in the land and property markets must be taken into account and the  best possible judgement must be made, but no one can predict whether the market  will rise or fall at a particular level. One must make one&rsquo;s best judgement at  the time. At least we have been able to address that issue in the in-year  monitoring round, so, happily, it will not hold back the scheme, and we can  proceed as planned.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  First, I ask the Minister to take the flattery as read. Has the Minister  identified any pattern and form in capital slippage, not only in particular  Departments, but in areas that have been tested for PFI consideration? Has  there been greater delivery and less slippage in projects that are being  assisted by the Strategic Investment Board (SIB) than in those that are being  taken forward by the Departments without SIB involvement?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On a number of points, the tables indicate that there have  been allocations as contributions to pension funds. Has the Minister carried  out an overall health check on the state of public-sector pension funds to  ensure that they are not faced with serial difficulties?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister also explain for what purpose the subsidy  of Northern Ireland Water is being used? The Executive  have said that they will not privatise the water service, but Northern Ireland Water is increasingly using private  contractors. Does that money go to Northern Ireland Water, or through Northern  Ireland Water to the contractors?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>: It would be more appropriate to put some of those questions to the Ministers who have direct  ministerial responsibility for the subjects concerned.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member asked me whether there are any patterns to capital slippage. To some extent, when a Finance  Minister receives money from Departments, few questions are asked.  However, perhaps my Department should examine  the patterns more closely. When capital schemes have not proceeded, it  has always been the standard practice of Government to recoup the money.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is not simply a matter of whether the Strategic  Investment Board or PFI schemes have been at fault, although I will try to  judge to what extent any slippage is tied up with those. However, the Member  knows that legal and planning issues and  regulations &mdash; particularly for roads  &mdash; can cause schemes to slip. Indeed, priorities often change when one  Minister replaces another. Therefore, there is a variety of reasons behind that  level of slippage.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The 2007-08 Budget allocations were set prior to the  agreement of Northern Ireland Water&rsquo;s strategic business plan in March 2007,  when it was agreed that the residual subsidy requirement of &pound;29&middot;9 million would be considered at the in-year monitoring  stage. My Department&rsquo;s action is consistent with that agreement. The bid of &pound;9&middot;4 million is to meet the remaining  subsidy required by Northern Ireland Water for the full delivery of its  strategic business plan.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure (Mr McElduff)</strong>: Go raibh  maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. My question relates specifically to the  Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure, and I refer the Minister to the table  on page 4 of his statement. Members of the Committee &mdash; not least Mr Shannon,  who is in the Chamber today &mdash; have expressed their disappointment at the amount  of money intended for the establishment of an Ulster-Scots academy that has been returned. Can the Minister offer any  guarantee or assurance to Members that the money  can be recovered when the project is at a greater state of readiness?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  The Chairperson of the Committee may be in a better position than me to deal  with several of those issues. I share his disappointment that the scheme has  not proceeded. However, the Minister has done the right thing by identifying as  early as possible that the project is not ready so that the money can be used  elsewhere.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The scheme will not become any less beneficial simply because  it cannot begin now. Undoubtedly, the Minister will make a new bid for the  scheme when he considers that it is ready to go ahead. However, it is up to the  Minister and his Committee to examine why the scheme has not been able to  proceed at this time.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McQuillan</strong>:  Will the Minister indicate how his allocation to DSD will allow it to provide  more social housing this year? He has touched on that subject, but I am  interested in his response.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  The figures in my statement indicate that the additional amount will enable  1,500 social houses to be built this year. That money will also allow the  number of houses in the co-ownership scheme to increase to 525. Together, that  achieves the target of providing over 2,000 social and affordable houses in the  year. Even at this stage, that exceeds the target that the Executive set in the  draft Budget, draft investment strategy and draft Programme for Govern&shy;ment. It will be up to the Executive, when they  examine the final versions of those  documents, to assess whether that trend can be sustained.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  For fear of being accused of flattery, I will simply welcome the statement as a  whole. The Minister will be aware that the Enler project in Ballybeen was the  subject of yesterday&rsquo;s Adjournment debate. Will he indicate whether in-year  bids were made for the project, and, if so, what are his views on it?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I confirm that neither of the Departments involved made a bid in respect of the  Enler project during the December monitoring round. Given the position that I  have outlined, the likelihood is that resources would have been allocated to  the relevant Department if such a bid had been made.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On 12 December 2007, my Department received a business case  from the Department for Social Develop&shy;ment &mdash; the lead Department on the  project &mdash; which was also on behalf of the Department of Health, Social Services  and Public Safety. On 20 December 2007, my officials raised some queries about  the business case, and both Departments have now responded to those queries.  The Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety responded on 9  January 2008, and the Department for Social Development responded on 14 January  2008. My officials will continue to examine the  business case, and it will be up to those Departments to make any bids.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps it is worth pointing out that we are in a unique  position in that some capital is still available &mdash; Ministers can still make  bids with the hope of having them met, provided that the business cases for their projects meet the necessary criteria.  Therefore, both Ministers may wish to  consider their position in the light  of where we now stand as regards capital allocations.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  note from the Minister&rsquo;s statement that there are reduced requirements of  &pound;132&middot;3 million in respect of capital investment, and that total bids allocated for capital investment amount to &pound;74&middot;1  million. That may cause confusion, particularly among the public. Will  the Minister elaborate on why bids were not met if the money was available?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  The bids that were not met fell into three categories. There was a bid from the  Department for Regional Development relating to funding for Northern Ireland  Water. The issue was simply whether the  organisation needed that funding during this financial year. Our view  was that it did not need the funding, although we nodded quietly in the  direction of the Minister for Regional Development to indicate that if the  funding were required during this financial year, we could address it in the  February monitoring round. We do not think that the funding will be needed  during this financial year, therefore, the  allocation was not met.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Bids from the Department for Social Development related to  redevelopment land. Those issues are being dealt with in the wider sense by the  capital realisation task force. Our view was that the issues should be resolved  by the task force before we get involved.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The final bid was from  the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in relation to  Forkhill army barracks. The issue was that we had not agreed a business case  for the project, and there are still some policy issues arising from it. Until  those issues are resolved, we will not agree to the bid. If the matters are  agreed, funding could be addressed in the February monitoring round.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  It is always important to flatter one&rsquo;s deputy leader, so I will begin by  saying that I welcome the fact that he has provided enough money for 700 new  social houses, taking into account the previous monitoring round and this one.  I hope that the Minister for Social  Development and the housing associations will follow through with quick  delivery of those projects.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am surprised that, despite his regular pleas of poverty  in the Chamber, the Minister of Health is returning &pound;17 million of his budget  at this stage of the year. Perhaps the Minister will comment on that.  Furthermore, despite the Department of Education&rsquo;s failing to deliver the  schools that were promised across Northern Ireland &mdash; including one in Island  Magee in my constituency &mdash; the Minister of Education has returned nearly 10% of  her capital budget, which amounts to &pound;30 million. That is a regular occurrence  with the Department of Education.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">How rigorously is the Minister of Finance and Personnel  testing capital bids from Departments that regularly hand back substantial  amounts of money &mdash; not just once but nearly every year &mdash; to ensure that they  are not overbidding, which deprives other Depart&shy;ments of the money, as a  safeguard in case they get round to spending the money?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I take the unusual position of defending some of my ministerial colleagues. The  Member must not forget that the allocations were made on the basis of budgets  which were settled by direct rule Ministers. Although money was handed back, the  Member will see that, in return, I agreed to provide money for other schemes  put forward by the Ministers concerned. However, there has traditionally been  underspend in all those Departments during the course of financial years. Ministers are responsible for ensuring that,  if money is allocated for public programmes &mdash; which  are very important &mdash; they are delivered on time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As far as education is concerned, during the process of  bilaterals &mdash; I should not be turning my back on you, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I was reluctant to mention it.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  During the period of bilaterals that Ministers engaged in, we robustly  questioned &mdash; I am hesitant to say &ldquo;cross-examined&rdquo; &mdash; all the Ministers on their  ability to spend the money being allocated to their Departments. That was done  particularly in light of the type of evidence that the Chairperson of the  Committee of Education has produced, which shows that there has been a history  of underspend in some Departments &mdash; particularly in capital schemes. That is an  important factor, and in time we will learn whether devolved Ministers are  different from their direct rule counterparts, which I hope they are, and are  able to deliver projects as planned. It is  important to emphasise that if resources are allocated to one Department  but not used, another Department that could use those resources is being denied  them.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has arranged to meet immediately upon the  lunchtime suspension. I propose, therefore, by leave of the Assembly, to  suspend the sitting until 2.00 pm.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The sitting was suspended at 12.23 pm.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">On resuming (Mr Speaker in the Chair) &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="5"></a>Executive Committee Business</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Charities Bill</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Second Stage</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for Social Development (Ms Ritchie)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That the Second Stage of  the Charities Bill [NIA 9/07] be agreed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The provisions of the  Bill include a series of measures that  will create a new regulatory framework for the charity sector in Northern Ireland.  I acknowledge the valuable and significant work carried out by charitable  organi&shy;sations &mdash; large and small, regional  and local &mdash; operating in Northern Ireland.  Their contribution to a diverse range of social, cultural, sporting and  religious activities is important. It is vital that we seek to provide a  structure and framework that protects and  supports the charitable sector, encourages good governance and, most  import&shy;antly, provides public confidence in charitable giving.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As Members will be aware, the charity sector in Northern Ireland  has not, to date, been overly regulated, and it could be said that our approach  has been characterised by a light touch. We have not had a register of  charities or a charity commission &mdash; as exists  in England and Wales. However,  the environment in Great Britain, the Republic of Ireland  and internation&shy;ally has changed. The Department for Social Develop&shy;ment (DSD) has carried out extensive public  consultation on a range of proposals, which fed into the Charities Bill.  We received numerous responses to the proposals &mdash; most of which were  favourable. The Department has sought to take on board issues about which  people expressed concerns.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill provides for a new, more detailed definition of  charities for Northern Ireland  &mdash; based on that which operates in England  and Wales,  but with added emphasis on the promotion of  peace and good community relations. That will provide clarity and  reflect a more modern view of the work in  which charities are engaged. It is proposed to put in place a strong  public-benefit test that states that no purpose will be presumed to be for the  public benefit. It will not be enough that an organisation can be considered  charitable by nature of their activities; they will be required to demonstrate  that in terms of public benefit. It is felt that a strong public-interest test  is important to maintaining public confidence in charities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill also establishes a new regulatory body, known as  the charity commission for Northern    Ireland. That  organisation will have a chief charity commissioner, a deputy and three  to five commissioners. It will increase public trust and confidence in  charities and promote compliance by the charity sector.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will establish a compulsory Northern Ireland register of charities, which  will include all charities that operate in Northern Ireland. The register will  include details of charities, and it will be available for public inspection.  The new charity commission for Northern    Ireland will work with other regulators on a  form of information sharing for those charities working across the islands and  on an all-island basis.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">All charities will be required to produce annual financial  statements in a specified form relative to their income levels and supply those to the charity commission for Northern Ireland.  They will also be required to submit a report on their activities during the  year, demonstrating their ongoing benefit. That is most important. The  commission will seek to ensure that the process of producing the returns and  submitting them will be as practical as possible, without diluting the  regulatory requirements.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In respect of the regulation of public charitable  collections, the Bill does away with the artificial distinction between street and house-to-house collections. It  brings all public charitable collections under a common umbrella and deals with  all collections for charitable, philanthropic or benevolent purposes. It will  establish a process whereby any organisation, whether a registered charity or  not, that wishes to conduct public collections will first be required to seek a  licence from the charity commission, which will entitle it to carry out  collections as a fit organisation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For each actual collection, a permit will also be required.  Initially, that permit will also be sought from the commission, but, in future,  it may be obtained from local authorities. That will ensure accountability and  give an assurance to the public, who will be able to check with the commission  whether a collection has been authorised.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will also introduce changes to the cy-pres scheme, which is a legal process that winds up  charities or changes their purpose. That scheme is currently dealt with  through the court system, and it is proposed that that responsibility will  become that of the new charity commission, thus saving considerable expense for  charitable organisations.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, the Bill will introduce a new legal entity for  charities, to be called charitable incorporated organis&shy;ations. Its purpose is  to avoid the need for charities that wish to benefit from incorporation to register  as companies, thus avoiding the need for them to undergo dual regulation with  the charity commission and Companies House.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill contains many positives, both for the charitable  sector and the general public, and I trust that the legislation will have the  support of all parties. It is worth noting that the legislation has the support  of all my Executive colleagues.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Social Development (Mr Hilditch)</strong>: The most  overwhelming reason for progressing the Charities Bill is our need for  legislation to modernise charity law. The Government need to create a modern  legal framework that will support and encourage a vibrant and diverse third  sector &mdash; a sector that plays such an important  role in the lives of people in Northern    Ireland. It provides vital services,  strengthens communities and is often an advocate for the marginalised in our  society.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The third sector has, for some considerable time, been  calling for the reform of charity law. It wants registration, regulation,  supervision and support. It is to be hoped that this Bill will provide all  those things. The Bill also presents an opportunity for the Assembly to give  legislative recognition to the important role that charities play in Northern Ireland.  It is estimated that the Province&rsquo;s third sector has an annual turnover of &pound;614  million and that it employs almost 4&middot;5% of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s workforce. That should give Members some idea of the extent of the voluntary and  community sector&rsquo;s contribution to society in Northern Ireland, and, indeed, to  its economy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not wish to go into too much detail on the Bill&rsquo;s  specific provisions. As Members will be aware, the Committee for Social  Development will conduct its own detailed scrutiny. It will form a view on the  Bill&rsquo;s specifics in due course. However, the  Committee believes that the Bill confirms the Government&rsquo;s commitment to  the growing importance of charities in our society. I hope that the legislation  will allow charities to keep pace with the modern social landscape, while  ensuring that they are accountable to the public.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill provides a  framework within which charities can thrive and continue to provide an  excellent service to society by: providing  statutory definitions of &ldquo;charity&rdquo; and &ldquo;charitable purpose&rdquo;;  establishing a charity commission for Northern Ireland and a charity tribunal  for Northern Ireland; creating a register of charities for Northern Ireland; introducing the charitable  incorporated organisations, which is a new form of charitable body; and setting out new rules on fund-raising and  collections.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">To put the definition of &ldquo;charity&rdquo; and &ldquo;charitable purpose&rdquo; on a statutory footing is of utmost  importance. At present, there is no statutory definition of a charity &mdash;  the legal concept has been developed through case law. The public must be  confident that all charities have been able to demonstrate that they provide  public benefit. The results of the Department for Social Development&rsquo;s  consultation on the draft legislation in 2006 included suggestions for what any  definition of a charity should include. That is something that the Committee  will want to consider.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The establishment of a charity commission and a charity  tribunal for Northern    Ireland is most welcome. The commission will  operate a register of charities, and it will perform regulatory and advisory  functions. It will also allow charities to  demonstrate their legitimacy and effectiveness and assure the public  that, adminis&shy;tratively, those organisations are sound.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The charity tribunal will hear appeals against some types  of decisions that the commission will make. I imagine that the Committee will  want to consider the cost and length of the appeals process when looking at  clause 14, because we do not want the process to be onerous and inflexible for  smaller charities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is currently no legislation for charities in Northern Ireland.  However, the Bill provides for the establishment  of a publicly accessible register of charities. The process of  registration will require charities to provide specific documents and  information to the commission. In  considering that process, the Committee will wish to ensure an adequate  balance between the need for accountability and transparency, and the need to  reduce the regulatory burden about which charities sometimes complain.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It must be remembered  that the legislation will apply to organisations of varying sizes. Some  of the smaller organisations have no paid staff, and proportionality is  essential.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill provides a replacement for the current licensing system for street and house-to-house  collections. The proposed new system to govern the collection of money  for charity will ensure strict regulation so that the public, as well as the  charity and the collectors, are protected.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">At present, the activities of professional fund-raisers are  not closely regulated in Northern    Ireland. The Bill makes provision for the  introduction of controls on fund-raising for charities that use professional  fund-raisers and commercial concerns. Professional fund-raisers must be more  accountable to the charities on whose behalf they collect.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is grateful to officials from the Department  for Social Development for their briefing on the principles and detail of the  Bill, and thanks them. The Committee looks forward to scrutinising the Bill in  detail and, as I said earlier, I do not wish to talk about the specifics of  each provision in advance of that scrutiny. It is a large and highly complex  Bill, and scrutiny will require much time and effort, not only from the  Committee but from the Department and from those organisations and individuals  who wish to provide evidence, whether oral or written.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Looking ahead, the  success of the proposed legislation, which provides only a broad  framework, will depend on the introduction of further regulations and guidance.  That, too, will be given careful consideration by the Committee.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister  for outlining the principles of the Bill, which is welcome. However, it is a  complex and technical piece of legislation, with approximately 184 clauses, and it will have an impact across the  community. I am sure that any difficulties will be dealt with as the Bill comes before the Committee for Social  Development.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I understand that the consultation process will begin in  the coming week, with advertisements in the local press. Moreover,  organisations such as NICVA (Northern Ireland Council for Voluntary Action)  will wish to consult their members. The consultation process normally lasts  approximately 30 days, and I ask the  Minister whether that period could, if necessary, be extended to  encompass all of the groups that may wish to respond. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I declare an interest as a member of the Young Farmers Clubs of Ulster, which  is a registered charity.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I pay tribute, as did Mr Hilditch, to the work of  charities, large and small; they give so much to society. Everyone, whether  they are making a financial contribution to a charity or working with it, must  have confidence in that charity, and confidence that money is seen to be  properly and appropriately used, with every penny accounted for. That is why  the Bill is important and why it has gained so much support. It is, therefore,  important that all Members support the Bill. The Ulster Unionist Party is more  than pleased to support the Minister and the proposed legislation.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I congratulate the Minister on bringing the Bill to the House, and I welcome  the opportunity to speak on its basic principles.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The measure to regulate  charities in Northern    Ireland is long overdue. In many  respects, charities have never been properly regulated. Therefore, we welcome  the introduction of the new regulatory context in which charities will operate.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Genuine charities have nothing to fear from the  legislation. I call on the Minister to reassure any bona fide charities that  they should welcome, rather than fear, the Bill. They should see it as a  support for their good work, and it should reassure members of the public who  donate to genuine charities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Many people fear change because they are used to the old  way of doing things. In the new context that the Bill will create, it will be  important to support those charities that have done so much good and valuable  work for people throughout Northern    Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As Mr Hilditch said,  charities raise some &pound;600 million a year, which is an enormous amount of  money for this part of Ireland.  That represents a huge challenge for people who raise funds for individual  charities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The establishment of a charity commission is an important  element of the Bill. Such commissions have, of course, been established in  other parts of these islands. It is therefore crucial that we examine those  models to ascertain whether we can use some aspects in our own commission.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that the Bill establishes a compulsory  register that will comprise all charities that operate throughout Northern Ireland.  That register must be open to public scrutiny.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is imperative to harmonise our charity laws with those  of the rest of this island, given that we work on an interconnected basis.  Therefore, one set of laws regulating charities must support the other and not  be contradictory. We should try to harmonise the charity laws of the various  jurisdictions of these islands.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The regulation of public charitable collections is another  crucial &mdash; and welcome &mdash; aspect of the Bill. The  distinction between street and household collections should be abolished in order that both are  regarded simply as public charitable collections. Such a move will reassure the ordinary person in the street or in  the home that they are contributing to a properly regulated body.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the changes that will be made to the cy-pres  scheme, and it is important that we consider those carefully. Cy-pres refers to  the point at which a charity has reached the end of its current registered purpose. I particularly welcome the fact that  responsibility for cy-pres will move to the new charity commission and  that the matter will not be dealt with in the courts. The courts have served us  well, but cy-pres is an expensive process, and it is important that charities  be given that facility so that they can  achieve less expensively and more easily their aims as a charity after  their current formation is no longer relevant to the special circumstances in  which we live today.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Bill, and I offer my support and that of my  party.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: In  common with the other Members who have spoken, I welcome the Bill. However, I  have a major concern about the provision on the designation of religious  charities. Clause 166 states that the charity commission:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;may, on receiving an application from the charity  trustees of a charity, make a designation under this section in relation to the  charity.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It appears that, following the raising of some  concerns, DSD officials met representatives  of the main Churches and, as a result, the Minister agreed to amend the  Bill to include provision for &ldquo;designated religious charity&rdquo; status. The Bill  stipulates that the charity commission must not make such a designation unless  certain conditions are satisfied. Two of those conditions are that the charity:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;has been established in Northern Ireland for at least 10  years &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">and &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;has a membership of at least 1000 persons who are&hellip;resident  in Northern Ireland&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am afraid that that provision will have a detrimental  effect on small rural churches and on faiths other than the main Christian  denominations. The long period of establishment required by the Bill will bar  many new faith communities from obtaining designated religious charity status  in Northern Ireland for many years. For example, the Belfast Chinese Christian  Church in south Belfast has been in existence for less than 10 years, so it  will not be granted religious charity status. The Jewish, Muslim and Baha&rsquo;i  communities may have established their places of worship for longer than the  required 10 years, but their membership will not be as many as 1,000; again,  they will not be granted designated religious charity status by the Bill.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I understand that DSD has conducted a screening exercise on  the proposals of the Bill, in accordance with section 75 of the Northern  Ireland Act 1998. As the public consultation on the Bill did not identify any  issues affecting any section 75 groups, DSD did not consider it necessary to  prepare a full equality impact assessment. I also understand that the  Department&rsquo;s legal advisers did not believe that the Bill would be  discriminatory against any section of the community. I cannot agree with that  view.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The criteria for designated religious charity status will  have a negative impact on all the newer and smaller faith communities in  Northern Ireland. That must be a concern for the Assembly in being fair to  those small communities, which may already be suffering from social isolation  and find that their faith offers them emotional and practical support at a time  when they most need it. I urge the Minister to amend the conditions of clause  166 and to reduce both the duration and membership requirements, so as not to  discriminate against particular sections of society.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: As  a member of the Social Development Committee,  I broadly welcome the Charities Bill, which will introduce an integrated  system of registration and regulation, including control of charitable  fund-raising and supervision and support for registered charities. The changing  nature of charities gives rise to concern about the lack of effective  regulation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is no statutory definition of &ldquo;charity&rdquo; in Northern  Ireland, and there is no legislation specifically governing the administrative  framework of charities. That is unlike the rest of the UK, and so I can see the  need to introduce the Charities Bill, which will provide definitions of &ldquo;charity&rdquo; and &ldquo;charitable purpose&rdquo;,  establish a charity commission, create a register of charities, provide for a  new form of charitable body and deal with regulation of charities and public  charitable contributions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, we must ensure that the operational costs and the number of staff involved are kept to an  absolute minimum, because it is vital that the Charities Bill does not  give birth to another over-bureaucratic quango that will cost the public purse  an absolute fortune.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with Anna Lo in that I am alarmed by some of the  criteria that the Bill contains on &ldquo;designated religious charity&rdquo; status. The  issue of how long a church or religious organisation has to have been established in Northern Ireland needs to be  investigated by the Committee, because the length of time proposed in  the Bill is much too long.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">More alarming is the membership criterion of 1,000. That will certainly suit most of the main  denominations in Northern    Ireland, but, unfortunately, it  discriminates against what can be called  independent, or congregation-based, faiths or Churches. One was referred  to earlier, but there are hundreds, if not thousands, of those little churches  dotted all across the Province. We need to take that concern on board.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I was pleased to receive support from both the Chairman and  a lot of the members when I raised those issues in the Committee, and I was  also pleased that they agreed that, where possible, the views of the  independent and congregational churches will be sought during the public  consultation process. It is vital that we have their views, and I hope that we  will be able to change those clauses.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that the Minister will take those concerns on  board, and I fully support the Bill.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  I am not on the Committee, and I missed  some of the Minister&rsquo;s statement, but I would like the Minister to  clarify whether the charity commission will have the power to look at charities  that claim that the bulk of their public donations, such as those for  health-related issues, go mainly to research, only for the balancing of the  books to reveal that most of it goes on administration? Will the commission  have the teeth either to pull those charities in and sort the issue out, or to  withdraw their charitable status?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Mr Brady raised a point earlier about the extension of the Committee Stage of  the Bill. That <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">can easily be resolved by a  motion from the Committee coming before the Assembly. That is the  procedure of the House.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development (Ms Ritchie)</strong>: I thank the Members who have contributed  to the debate for their remarks.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Charities Bill will introduce a framework for the  regulation of charities that is, as far as possible, consistent with  developments across Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland, and which meets  the particular <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">needs of Northern Ireland and  will promote best practice in the governance of the charitable sector.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will bring Northern   Ireland broadly in line with charity regulations in Great Britain and Ireland. No one wants our standards  for charitable regulation to be weaker than those which are in place in GB;  that would make Northern Ireland  a soft option open to possible abuse by criminal elements. I want to assure the  House that that will not happen.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The public, who continue to give so generously, need to be  assured that they will be giving to a genuine charity when they make a donation  in cash or in kind. I ask the House to support the Bill and send it to the  Committee for Social Development for scrutiny.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt; ">I now turn to some of  the issues that were raised during the debate. I thank the Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee, Mr Hilditch, for his comments. I welcome his  positive comments and I look forward to working <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">with the Committee as it scrutinises the Bill. I emphasise that  it is at Committee Stage that Committee members will have the opportunity to go  through the Bill line by line, provide their comments and deal with any amendments and issues that they may have. My  officials will be present at those meetings to take Committee members  through the Bill. The Committee Stage is the right democratic format for  scrutinising the Bill.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Hilditch made a number of valid points about the need  for proportionality when applying regulations, particularly in relation to  smaller charities. As regards the cost of  tribunals, the first stage will involve a process review by the proposed charity commission for Northern<span style="letter-spacing:0pt; "> Ireland. Individuals, or charities, may seek to appeal through the proposed  charity tribunal for Northern    Ireland, which will be operated through the  Northern Ireland Court Service. I assure Members that there will be no cost  involved to charities unless they decide to invoke legal representation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Brady asked for the Committee Stage of the Bill to be  extended. As Minister with responsibility for the Bill, I am anxious to get it  passed. However, the length of the Committee Stage is a matter for the  Committee and the facility offered by you, Mr Speaker.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Maginness rightly highlighted the need to work with  other regulators in taking forward the legislation. A regulators&rsquo; forum has been established involving other UK regulators  and the Irish regulator. I am anxious to ensure that there is a consistent  approach across these islands while recognising the unique circumstances in  each jurisdiction. I am meeting Minister &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, the Minister with  responsibility for charities legislation in D&aacute;il  &Eacute;ireann, next month, and I want to discuss with him how we will deal  with cross-border charities and how we will work together as legislation is  implemented across the island   of Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Anna Lo and Jonathan Craig referred to major concerns about  designated religious status that were raised  at last week&rsquo;s Committee meeting. It is important to highlight that that designation will only be  considered subsequent to an  organisation&rsquo;s recognition as a charity. It will have no bearing on the  recognition, in the first place, of a religious body as a charity, and I assure  the House that I will consider all views on the issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Ms Lo and Mr Craig also asked why all faith-based  organisations cannot be granted designated religious status. I advise the House  that there would be a significant risk involved in opening the exemption to all  religious organisations. It is important that religious organisations are  established bodies with proper governance arrangements in place. For that  reason, one criterion is that an organisation must be established in Northern Ireland  for at least 10 years, which is a reasonable period of time in which to judge  whether it <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">has effective governance and  accountability arrangements in place. Religious organisations must also  have a membership of at least 1,000 at the denominational level. The threshold  was set at 3,000 in Scotland,  but it was felt that in the Northern    Ireland context a lower figure was more  appropriate, taking into account our population size and the number of smaller,  independent churches in operation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My Department sought legal advice, and I am sure that  article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights was applied in that  instance, because that deals with the limiting nature of displacement in  pursuit of a legitimate aim for the regulation of charities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee Stage of the Bill is the occasion on which to  address and discuss such matters. At that time it is possible, if members of  the Committee so choose, to suggest amendments, and my officials are able to  discuss the background to particular issues.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mrs Robinson spoke about the proposed charity commission&rsquo;s power and teeth. The charity  commission will have the power to  identify and investigate apparent misconduct or mismanagement in the  administration of charities and to take remedial or protective action. It will  liaise closely with the Police Service of Northern Ireland, HM Revenue and Customs and other regulators; however, the real power will be with the public.  It must always be remembered that it is the public who give money to  charities, and the reporting mechanism lies there because it is the public that  will be in a position to tell what is actually happening on the ground.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Charities will be obliged to submit annual financial statements, which, importantly, will be available  for public scrutiny. In that way, the public will have the facility and  capacity to consider how and to whom to donate. Therefore, the decision to  donate will always lie with individuals or collectively with members of the  public.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If I have not addressed  all of the issues, I will provide written replies to Member&rsquo;s questions.  I am grateful to all the Members who have contributed to a helpful debate on this important piece of legislation, I  commend the Bill to the House, and I look forward to discussions in the  Committee.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That the Second Stage of the  Charities Bill [NIA 9/07] be agreed.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading"><a name="6"></a>Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Consideration Stage</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Members will have a copy of the Marshalled List of Amendments detailing the  order for consideration. The amendments have been grouped for debate in my  provisional grouping of amendments selected list.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is only one group of amendments, and we will debate  all the amendments in the group together. The debate will be on the opposition  of the Minister and the Chairperson of the Health Committee to clause 15 of the  Bill, and two consequential amendments that are needed if clause 15 is removed.  I will therefore only call amendment No 1 and amendment No 2 if clause 15 is  removed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I remind Members intending to speak that, during the debate  on the amendments, they should address all the amendments in the group on which  they wish to comment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Once the initial debate on the group is completed, any  subsequent amendments in the group will be moved formally as we go through the  Bill, and the Question on each will be put without further debate. The  Questions on stand part will be taken at the appropriate points in the Bill. If  that is clear, we shall proceed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic"><strong>Clause 2 (Provision of dental services)</strong></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question proposed, <span style="font-style:normal; ">That  the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Deeny</strong>: I am seeking clarification from the Minister and his  Department. I understand that clause 2 relates to the suspension of  practitioners &mdash; not just GPs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Last year, at a meeting of the Health Committee, I raised  the issue of the suspension of practitioners by health boards, and I was told  that the procedures would become clearer over time &mdash; or words to that effect.  Although I am particularly interested in the suspension of GPs, the suspension  of any practitioner before the evidence had been viewed by a tribunal would be  grossly unfair and could destroy an innocent doctor&rsquo;s career due to a breakdown  of the doctor-patient relationship or trust. Suspension would have a very  serious impact on a GP.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In agreement with the  BMA, I contend that suspension is not a neutral act. That was the  opinion in law in the recent case of Mezey vs South West London and St George&rsquo;s Mental Health  NHS Trust. The judgement of Lord Justice Sedley was that, in relation to the  employ&shy;ment of a qualified professional in a function which was as much a  vocation as a job:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Suspension changes  the status quo from work to no work, and it inevitably casts a shadow over the  employee&rsquo;s competence. Of course this does not mean that it cannot be done, but  it is not a neutral act.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Therefore, on behalf of my fellow practitioners, I  am asking the Minister for reassurance that  suspension will not be taken  lightly, and that the removal of practitioners, including GPs, from the  performers list will not be done at the stroke of a pen. Will the Minister and  his senior officials make it clear to me, and to all other practitioners, that  the Bill contains strict, rigid and robust criteria and arrangements that must  be complied with before a practitioner can be suspended?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have one final question, which may or may not be  relevant. The Bill mentions &ldquo;boards&rdquo;. As the Minister knows, and as he has  announced, the boards will be abolished around April 2009. If the Bill goes  through, suspension is to be undertaken by &ldquo;boards&rdquo;. Who will have this  responsibility after April 2009? Will it be the local commissioning groups or a  central authority?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Before I call the Minister to respond, does any Member wish to speak on that  clause? If not, I call the Minister.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: I wish to  reassure Dr Deeny that suspension cannot be carried out at the stroke of a pen.  It will not be done lightly; there will be  robust procedures in place. The Bill provides enabling powers. The details surrounding suspension, for  example the length of suspension, will be set out in regulations and in  detailed guidance for the boards. Those regulations will be subject to  consultation and scrutiny by the Health Committee, if necessary. The Bill  merely provides an enabling power; the detail has still to be determined. That  can be determined in consultation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The power is deemed to be essential to ensure that the care  of patients is not compromised. Members will be  aware that the legislation was prompted by the inquiry into the Shipman affair. Shipman was a notorious  doctor who is thought to have  murdered more than 250 patients over his lifetime in medical practice.  This legislation is the response to that event.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I can give the Member the assurances that he asked for, and  I can tell him that the regulations must be put to consultation and scrutiny.  The Bill merely provides an enabling power.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The boards are mentioned in the Bill because they are in place at present. I am happy to meet the  Member, or write to him, to discuss the details. He is correct to say  that the boards will disappear in the next year. I will write to him about what that term &ldquo;the boards&rdquo; means.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Clauses 3 to 14 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic"><strong>Clause 15 (Smoking: exemption for performers)</strong></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  We now come to the debate on opposition to clause 15 and the proposed  consequential amendments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><em>Question proposed,</em> That the clause stand part of the  Bill.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>: This clause contains an  amendment to the Smoking (Northern Ireland)  Order 2006 that will enable regulations to be made allowing smoking by a performer where:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the artistic  integrity of the performance makes it appropriate for them to smoke&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Members may recall that during the Second Stage of  the Bill on 19 June 2007, I informed the Assembly that I no longer supported  clause 15.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 15 was inserted in the original Order in Council at Westminster at the behest  of the previous Administration. The Order was subsequently translated into the  Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which is now before the House.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The theatrical profession argued for an exemption on the  grounds that to outlaw actual smoking would severely compromise the artistic  integrity of some productions. It further argued that should no such exemption be provided, it was opposed to the  definition of tobacco covering &ldquo;any other lit substance&rdquo;. That definition, which is contained in the Smoking (Northern Ireland) Order 2006, prohibits the use of non-tobacco products, such as herbal cigarettes, which are not  covered by smoke-free legislation in the Republic of Ireland.  Such cigarettes are one method by which performers may smoke during a  performance in the Republic.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On the other hand, representations that were made to me by health professionals and others focused  largely on the availability of alternative methods of smoking and on concerns that such an exemption would  undermine the rationale behind the introduction of smoke-free  legislation, namely, the protection of public health.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I considered carefully the various arguments that were made  both for and against an exemption. I too believe that actual smoking is not  essential to protect the integrity of a  particular performance and that suitable alternatives, including unlit  cigarettes, can be used. In addition, even if I accepted the argument that was  made by the theatrical profession, I do not believe that it outweighs  public-health considerations. Employees who work in the entertainment industry  are entitled to the same level of protection from tobacco smoke as everyone  else.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to herbal cigarettes, I fully accept the  argument that to amend the definition in the Smoking (Northern Ireland)  Order 2006 would place an unreason&shy;able burden on enforcement officers  by requiring them to establish the constituent parts of the lit substance before deciding whether an offence had been  committed. That view is consistent with the approach that has been taken  in England, Scotland and Wales, and it also reflects concerns about the definition of herbal  cigarettes and the health risks that are associated with them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, I seek Members&rsquo; support to oppose the Question  that clause 15 stand part of the Bill. If clause 15 is removed, two minor  consequential amendments will be required. The commencement of clause 15 will need  to be removed from clause 19, which sets out commencement provisions for all  clauses in the Bill. Reference to the smoking amendment in the long title will  also need to be removed.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mrs I Robinson)</strong>:  Before I speak about clause 15, I will say a few words about the Committee  Stage of the Bill. The Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill was referred to  the Committee for Health, Social Services  and Public Safety on 20 June 2007. The Committee considered the Bill at  eight separate meetings. A total of 24 organisations responded to the  Committee&rsquo;s request for written evidence. The Committee took oral evidence  regarding the main provisions in the Bill from departmental officials and six  organisations before commencing the detailed clause-by-clause scrutiny of the  Bill.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank all those individuals and organisations that provided written evidence, those who gave oral  evidence, and particularly the  officials who helped the Committee go through the detailed provisions of  the Bill over a number of meetings. I also commend all the members of the Committee for their work in considering the  detail of the Bill, which was the first Committee Stage of a Bill that  the Committee has undertaken. Furthermore, I thank staff for their assistance.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">During the Committee Stage, the Committee considered the  provisions of the Bill in detail. The Committee concluded that it was content  to support all the provisions of the Bill, apart from clause 15, which it  agreed to oppose.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 15, if enacted,  would provide power to exempt performers from the smoking ban.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As the Minister has  indicated, the proposed exemption had been inserted into article 17 of  the original draft Order in Council by the then direct rule Minister. The Order in Council had not concluded its passage  through Westminster  before the restoration of devolution, so the Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety had the option of removing that provision from the Bill before it was laid in the Assembly, but  he decided that it should remain in the legislation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, during the debate on Second Stage, the Minister  indicated that he had changed his mind and intended to table an amendment at  Consideration Stage to remove the clause. I welcomed that move. I believe that  the Minister&rsquo;s change of heart was influenced largely by the strong opposition  that was voiced in Committee during an initial departmental briefing and in  view of the opinion of the Chief Medical Officer, who told the Committee that  he could not support the introduction of such an exemption.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In undertaking its detailed consideration, the Committee  recognised that the Bill, as laid before it, still included provision for the  exemption. Therefore, it needed to listen to the arguments for and against the  proposal. Eleven of the organisations that made written submissions to the Committee had commented on clause 15, and all were opposed to the exemption of  performers from the smoking ban. The Committee received no written submissions in support of the exemption;  however, it was aware that, during the earlier consultation that the  Department had conducted, both the Theatrical Management Association and the  Arts Council of Northern Ireland had argued for the exemption.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee felt it appropriate to give those  organisations the opportunity to put their case. They argued strongly in  Committee that, because of what they  considered the unique circumstances of theatre, film and television,  smoking was sometimes required to establish  character, period, historical accuracy or setting. They concluded that,  if the exemption was not granted:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;smoking would become  one of the few human behaviours that could not be simulated on stage.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">They also  pointed to the fact that the exemption applies in England and  suggested that, if it were not possible to grant similar exemption in Northern   Ireland, consideration should be given to permitting the use of herbal cigarettes during  performances, as is permitted in the Republic   of Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee also heard oral evidence from the Smokefree Northern Ireland Coalition, which  represents the public, private, community and voluntary sectors and  statutory bodies. The coalition had been set up to lobby for smoke-free  legislation. It was successful in lobbying for the introduction of the smoking  ban in workplaces, which came into effect  in April last year. In evidence to the Committee, the coalition pointed  to the conclusion that the World Health  Organization reached:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;there is no safe level of exposure to  second-hand tobacco smoke.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The coalition  also advised the Committee that it regarded performers, as defined in  the Bill, as:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;another workforce,  who must be protected from the effects of passive smoking.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Its representatives pointed out that the proposed  exemption was not limited to performances in theatres but was loosely defined  and could cover a performance in any venue, including a public house, a hall or  a even a school. The coalition also opposed the use of herbal cigarettes,  because of the absence of evidence as to whether  such cigarettes pose a danger to health, and the difficulties that their  use could cause for enforcement of the smoking ban. The coalition&rsquo;s  representatives stated that their belief was:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;when substances such  as herbal cigarettes are burned, similar cocktails of lethal chemicals are  produced. There is no safe level, and we should not be exposing ourselves to  them.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText" style="text-indent:0cm;">The  coalition pointed out that tobacco is a lethal cocktail of 4,000 chemicals,  including ammonia, arsenic and cyanide, and, in its opinion, herbal cigarettes  could be described as cigarettes minus the nicotine, and could therefore  contain the other 3,999 chemicals.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Smoking is still the  major preventable cause of death and  disease. It is associated with more than 50 different diseases and  disorders, many of them fatal. In his most recent annual report, the Chief  Medical Officer pointed out that smoking kills 2,300 people in Northern Ireland  each year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The introduction of the smoking ban in workplaces in 2007  was a major step forward that will, ultimately, save lives and protect the  health of the workforce. I am totally opposed to any dilution of the smoking  ban and, therefore, to clause 15.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I support the removal of clause 15 of  the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. As the Chairperson said, the removal of clause 15 is supported by all  members of the Committee, having carried out rigorous examination and scrutiny  of the Bill. The Committee heard from several organisations that were mainly  opposed to clause 15; with that information, and on the advice of the Chief  Medical Officer, Sinn F&eacute;in chose to support the removal of the clause. The  right of the entire workforce to work in a smoke-free environment must be  protected. I am totally opposed to any move away from that. Therefore I support  the removal of clause 15 and thank the Minister for his intention to oppose  that it stand part of the Bill. It is a good example of how Committee scrutiny  can affect ministerial decisions. I thank the Minister for taking that on  board. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert  Coulter</strong>: I support the Minister&rsquo;s proposition. I, too, am against any  dilution of the Bill that would create a loophole to allow people to smoke in  any context. As the Chairperson said, it became clear to the Committee when it  took evidence that it would be wrong for the House to support the inclusion in  the Bill of any means by which smoking could be permitted in enclosed spaces, particularly  one where large numbers of people meet for entertainment. Therefore I support  the removal of clause 15.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Deeny</strong>: I support the Health Minister and commend the Health Committee  for its consistent and unanimous opposition to clause 15. I do so as a member  of the Health Committee and, indeed, as a doctor. I agree with the Minister  that there are other ways in which smoking can be realistically simulated on  stage. The smoke-free environment that  exists throughout the home countries has already shown positive health  benefits. Therefore I want to put on record that I support the removal of  clause 15.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  I thank Members who have contributed to the debate and reiterate that, as  Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, I, like the rest of the House, have a responsibility to  promote public health and the interests of all the people of Northern Ireland.  Therefore I encourage Members to support my decision to oppose that clause 15  stand part of the Bill; in other words, to vote against the clause.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Before I put the Question, I remind Members that a no vote on clause 15 will  ensure that there is no smoking exemption for performers. I want to clarify  that for the House.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and negatived.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Clauses 16 to 18 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</p>

	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: I forgot to say that one amendment has been selected and  published on the Marshalled List. The proposer of the amendment will have 10  minutes to propose and 10 minutes for the winding-up speech.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s attendance at  the debate, and I accept the amendment that  has been tabled by Mr Basil McCrea and Mr David McClarty. The two main  pieces of legislation relating to employment agencies  are the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Northern Ireland) Order 1981 and the Conduct of  Employment Agencies and Employment Businesses Regulations (Northern Ireland)  2005. A proposal for an EU directive on working conditions for temporary  workers is at an advanced stage in Brussels.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Employment agencies are sprouting up all over the country.  By any definition, it is a growth industry. However, if we are to protect  workers against erosion of their rights then we must be wary of the  introduction of that particular approach into our recruitment and employment  practices.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are almost 600 employment agencies on the island of Ireland, where there is a workforce of  approximately three million workers. When those figures are compared to those  of other countries, such as Poland  &mdash; from where so many migrant workers come &mdash; where there are more than 770  agencies catering for 40 million workers, it becomes clear that we have a  disproportionate number of recruitment and employment agencies and workers who  are employed through such agencies.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Temporary or short-term contract workers are unable to  access equal terms and working conditions when compared to those of  directly-recruited workers. Recent research in Britain has established that agency  workers are paid, on average, only 68% of the directly-paid workforce&rsquo;s  earnings, had fewer entitlements, are younger than their directly-employed  counterparts and have less control over the work that they are tasked to do.  Members may not be aware that more than 100 of the Assembly&rsquo;s support staff, or  more than 30% of the entire support staff complement are agency workers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I understand that that is not unusual in many other  public-sector organisations, and that the ratio in the private sector is higher  and growing.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to record that those workers have no  pension rights entitlements, no sickness benefits, no statutory holiday  entitlements, and no flexitime allowances &mdash; the list goes on. For those  workers, there is no employment security or certainty and, consequently, those  individuals and their families have particular difficulty in raising bank  loans, and so on. They must think very carefully about long-term spending  commitments, such as mortgages. For many, moving home is simply not an option  because of the financial risks involved.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Agency workers are, in effect, working for two employers,  and they are in the invidious position of seeing many new starts in the  permanent workforce take up employment at the going rate, often earning more  than agency staff, whose incomes are effectively fixed at the contract start  date. In some instances, those contract workers are employed for a number of  years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Examples of abuse of  the system of employing agency workers  abound. Indeed, many European Governments, including those in Westminster and Dublin, have moved  to counter some of the activities of those who have become known to all of us  as gangmasters.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Following the recent announcement of the loss of more than 900 jobs at Seagate Technology in  Limavady, it transpired that a number of the workers at that plant were  contracted through employment agencies and were not entitled &mdash; nor were they  offered &mdash; the same redundancy packages as the directly employed staff. It is bad enough that, while in employment, those  workers do not receive the same rates of pay and conditions as permanent  staff, but when they face the same trauma of redundancy as their fellow  workers, they are once again disadvantaged by exclusion or by reductions in  severance packages.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We should not allow  that method of worker recruitment to become prevalent in our society, as  it serves only to diminish workers&rsquo; rights and rates of remuneration, while absolving  employers, including multinational conglomerates, of their obligations to  provide statutory and other benefits to their agency workers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is incumbent on us as legislators to ensure that we provide equal opportunity and treatment for all  workers. There is a growing concern &mdash; and a well-founded one &mdash; that the  growth in the employment agency sector creates the conditions for exploitation  and abuse of those workers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to state  that not all agencies are involved in  such practices. In fact, many of them provide profess&shy;ional support and  a professional service. However, we must ask why we need such growth in the  number of agencies on this small island and who is benefiting from them. We  must, in co-operation with the trade union movement, commit to implementing  measures that will protect the rights of agency workers to equal pay, pensions  and other benefits that are awarded to those who are directly employed by  companies.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly should  assert that it is a basic principle that workers be employed on the  basis of equal pay for equal work. I strongly urge the Minister to introduce  legislation that would provide pay parity for agency workers from an initial  date of employment. The Assembly should lead by example and by endorsing  efforts in Europe to reach political agreement  on the draft EU directive on temporary agency workers. We should support  proposals in that directive to allow temporary  workers full pay and conditions on completion of a minimum of six weeks&rsquo;  employment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The argument that is put forward by those who oppose efforts to address the gross inadequacy in  social and employment legislation is  that extending equal rights to agency  workers will harm economic competitiveness. We have all heard that  argument, but it does not stand up to examination. Every state in Europe that  ranks ahead of Ireland and Britain in  competitiveness tables already has such legislation in place. Therefore, the  proof of the pudding is in the eating.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Failure to implement protective measures that would provide  equality in the workplace for agency workers is an open invitation to abuse  unorganised labour, such as temporary and migrant workers. That will inevitably  result in conflict in the workplace.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly already recognises and promotes the need for  economic sustainability. We advocate and support job-creation strategies and  the upskilling and retraining of workers. We place a particular emphasis on the  small and medium-sized enterprises in our economic  policy, and all of that is to the good. However, none of those  political, social and economic goals need be at the cost of workers&rsquo; basic  rights &mdash; equal terms and conditions. I am convinced that there is an urgent  requirement for legislation that will recognise and enforce the rights of  agency workers to equal pay and conditions after the initial six-week period  following commencement of employment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We should reject the notion that economic viability can be achieved only on the back of our most  vulnerable workers, who are left in a cycle of no rights, low pay and  job insecurity.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Bearing in mind the mobility of workers across the island,  I encourage the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment to work with his  Twenty-six County counterpart, Miche&aacute;l Martin, Minister of Enterprise, Trade  and Employment, to explore the possibility of further co-operation between the  two Departments to develop an all-Ireland  agency workers&rsquo; rights framework and protocol. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>:  I beg to move the following amend&shy;ment:  Leave out all after &ldquo;agency workers&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank Mitchel McLaughlin for proposing the motion and for  accepting the amendment in my name and that of Mr Basil McCrea. I do not speak  out of turn when I contend that everyone in the Assembly wants the best  possible protection and conditions for all workers in Northern Ireland, whether  agency workers or regular employees. However, the original motion, if passed,  would have sent a message from the Assembly to businesses in Northern Ireland and Europe  that we are uncompetitive and closed to investment. At a time of economic challenges, that message could be  considered self-defeating, and one that would undermine Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  economic competitiveness.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Currently, agency workers in the UK have good employment rights.  They are entitled to the national minimum wage, and are covered by health and  safety and working-time legislation. Under the new working-time regulations  approved by the Assembly yesterday, agency workers are now entitled to the same  generous paid holidays as long-term employees. I welcome the motion, however,  because no Member of the Assembly wants agency workers to be exploited by rogue  or irresponsible employers. That is a serious matter, and, wherever possible,  the working conditions offered by such employers should be improved on.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is a fact that agency workers help business and the economy in Northern Ireland. They allow firms  to meet peaks in demand and deal with seasonal fluctuations. They help  firms to meet skills shortages and cover absences in the regular workforce. Northern Ireland  is trying to encourage investment and economic growth, and one of our strongest  selling points is a flexible and fair employment regime. To support the motion  in its original form would have sent a message that threatens that position.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It should also be noted  that registering with an agency is of benefit to workers too. Agency  work is often a crucial first step for young people into employment, and it  facilitates those who need flexibility. Figures show that 40% of first-time  agency workers are labour market outsiders, and 40% of agency workers are in  longer-term employment within one year of starting their first agency  assignment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The issue of equality of pay also requires further  examination. The most recent data provided by the Recruitment and Employment  Confederation &mdash; in 2007 &mdash; shows that 67% of employers reported that temporary  agency workers in their businesses receive equal or more pay than their  colleagues on permanent contracts. A much  smaller percentage of agency workers are  employed in the lower-paid, lower-skilled sectors than is often imagined. For example, agency workers  make up just 1% of the retail  workforce. Many skilled temporary workers in IT and accountancy earn  significantly more than their permanent counterparts.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members will know that this issue is the subject of  continued discussion at EU level. If the motion had been passed in its original  form, it would have sent a message that the Northern Ireland Assembly is out of  step with the UK Government&rsquo;s position on the EU directive on temporary agency  workers. The UK Government broadly support securing extra rights and improved  conditions for temporary workers throughout the EU, providing that the benefits  to the employer and the temporary worker  alike are not lost due to a complete loss of flexibility. </p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A significant qualifying period before comparative benefits  come into effect, in line with other time-related employment rights, is  reasonable. It should be noted that that position is also strongly supported by  the Government of the Republic   of Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is no gain for the UK  economy in general, or for this part of the UK economy in particular, in  creating local legislation or provisions concerning this issue. We would hand  further competitive economic advantage to  our neighbours and European counterparts, and we would fail all of the  people of Northern Ireland  and those EU citizens who benefit from our flexible working conditions and who  seek a vibrant and buoyant economic future.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For all those reasons, I urge all parties on all sides of  the House to support the amendment. More work must be done to improve the  conditions of temporary workers in Northern Ireland. However, we  should heed the statistics of the Governments of both the UK and the Republic of Ireland  regarding the need to secure flexible labour markets and economic  competitiveness.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>: I  support the amendment and the general thrust of what the proposers of the  motion and the amendment have sought to achieve. Some rights should be  extended, and those that are in place should be enforced. The whole issue of  agency workers&rsquo; rights has been ignored for far too long, to the detriment of  thousands of workers. Although they make up only a small proportion of our  overall workforce, agency workers are an important part of our labour market  and are currently protected by a range of employment laws. However, the current  protection mechanisms fall short of what is required.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Employers across Northern   Ireland benefit greatly from agency workers, who provide  a measure of flexibility that enables our economy to perform competitively  against competing forces across Europe. As  they provide such a benefit to our economy, agency workers deserve parity on a range of factors regarding their  employment. However, while supporting the general aim of parity, caution  must be exercised in determining when an agency worker should become eligible  for parity. The proposed six-week period is too short and would be of detriment to our economic competitiveness. The  Assembly has supported a draft Programme for Government that has  economic development at its core. Therefore, we should exercise caution and  give serious consideration to the implications of the proposal. At the same  time as protecting the worker, we must ensure that we do not encourage  practices that fly in the face of economic development.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are examples of extreme cases of abuse of agency  staff. I am sad to say that Depart&shy;ments have been at least as guilty as  private enterprise in that. I know of a case in which an agency employee has  worked from 9.00 am to 3.00 pm for 12 years in the same Department. That  employee has carried out the full duties,  similar to those of permanent staff, without being afforded the same  pension rights, for example, as her permanent colleagues. If she is sick, she  receives only statutory sick pay, and not the other benefits afforded to her  colleagues. Furthermore, she receives a lower rate of pay, and she does not  receive yearly increments, as do other workers. Her conditions in many other areas,  including annual leave and bank holidays,  are worse than those of her colleagues.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In that same Department, another member of agency staff has  worked for eight years, and another for six years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I suggest that people who have worked in that Department for  12, eight and six years are in full-time employment, and their positions should  have been made permanent. Their situation is  an absolute disgrace, and the Minister and the Department must seriously  examine the issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to the more short-term employment of agency  staff, the matter comes to a head.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Short-term employment provides many people with an  opportunity to work flexible hours to suit their circumstances. Many are  mothers who are returning to the workplace as an essential first step back into  the labour market. The ability to balance work and life is important to such  groups, and care must be taken not to discourage employers from using them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the light of the warning from 58% of employers that the  requirement for agency staff to work for six weeks before achieving equality  would lead to a significant reduction in the use of temporary staff, I urge the  Minister to consider carefully how such a directive could be rolled out.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I urge him also to examine all Departments that are attached to the Executive. I could name the  Department to which I referred earlier, but I will not do so now because  there is an ongoing tribunal. The practice is not specific to one Department:  it is widespread across Departments and must, along with other matters, be given  serious attention. I support the amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I want to comment on the speech by the proposer of the motion, whose arguments  I fully understand. I also understand the issues that have informed the  amendment, but I expected to hear more convincing arguments in its support. The  following are, as I understand them, the arguments put forward by the Member  who moved the amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The first argument was  that, if the Assembly supported the original motion, it would be out of  step with the UK Government. That may be the case, but not to support it would  mean that the Assembly would be out of step  with 14 of the 20 member states of the European Union. All 14 countries  have introduced equal pay for agency workers. I acknowledge the variations in  the guarantees that are given to workers on other working conditions.  Nonetheless, I suggest that the Assembly try to follow the lead of those 14  countries that are ahead of the UK Government on the single issue of equal pay.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, Members were told that, if agreed, the original  motion would be a block to competitiveness. The same argument was used in 2002  &mdash; and before that &mdash; when legislation was introduced to provide guarantees to part-time workers. Many of the  employers&rsquo; organisations said that the guarantees should not be provided  as they would be a block to competitiveness. Now, five and six years later, the  number of part-time workers is increasing. Some of those who were hostile to  giving part-time workers the same guarantees as permanent workers now recruit  more part-timers &mdash; despite their having the  same conditions of employment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If the Assembly is serious about increasing the North&rsquo;s  competitiveness, I am sure that the Minister will concur with me that it will  come from the skills base, the number of students achieving PhDs, research and  development, and innovation. That, rather than by according agency workers  fewer entitlements than their permanent colleagues, is how the North should  position itself in the global market.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must acknowledge the potential scale of the problem. A TUC survey, which may not be  definitive as it involved only 85  workplaces and 100,000 employees, found that 18% of staff were agency  workers. The survey questioned staff on some of the problems that agency  workers were experiencing. Despite the regulations  that set out guarantees for temporary agency workers, the survey found  that they were allowed fewer holidays, given little or no access to training,  were not entitled to contractual sick pay and received no employers&rsquo; contributions  to their pension schemes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Admittedly, the TUC did not gather its evidence in the  North.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  The Member has highlighted an important point and given an accurate description  of the situation in which many agency workers find themselves.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Is the answer not that those who are responsible for  enforcing the regulations ought to be more diligent and that those who employ  agency workers ought to ensure that the agencies that they use live up to their  legal obligations?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>: I thank the Member for his intervention. The best way to deal  with this is to use the approach adopted in Northern Ireland to fair employment  legislation. The North began to change its legacy of disadvantage and  discrimination by creating a body with sufficient powers to force all employers  to comply with the law. A legislative base was created that guaranteed that  people would not be discriminated against on the basis of their religious or  political views. A resource base was also  created to ensure that offending employers were taken before a fair  employment tribunal and exposed, and employees who suffered discrimination  received reparation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Why can that approach not be used with agency workers? Why  can we not have laws that guarantee agency workers their entitlements? Why can  we not give powers to an enforcement agency to guarantee agency workers their  entitlements? Why can we not put resources into guaranteeing agency workers  their entitlements? That is what I wanted to be included in the amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It seems that Members are not prepared to support the  original motion, which calls for agency workers to be provided with the same pay, conditions and statutory  entitlements as the directly employed workforce. However, the Assembly should  go further than calling for just the necessary measures.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The history of this part of Ireland has taught us that the  necessary measures include firm laws, firm enforcement, firm guarantees, and  sufficient funds to make employers behave themselves. The amendment does not  mention those and I find that disappointing, because that might have created  some consensus in the Chamber today.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>:  The Alliance Party welcomes the issue being raised in the Assembly, as  it provides an opportunity to discuss the  balance between employees&rsquo; and employers&rsquo; rights.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, the original motion goes too far; therefore we  welcome Sinn Fein&rsquo;s decision to accept the amend&shy;ment. The original motion  would create legislation to tackle an issue  that could be tackled by applying existing legislation properly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Most Members will have received representations from agency  staff who are being treated unfairly, as Mr Spratt highlighted. That is not  because they do not have rights; it is because their rights are not properly  enforced. The motion renders the use of temporary agency staff pointless; it  would remove a recruitment tool that is important not just for local businesses  but also for public sector bodies, particularly health and social services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On the other hand, the amendment is a little weak, as it  fails to clarify what the necessary measures are. Having listened to the  debate, the Alliance Party intends to support the amendment, but we will keep  the issue under review. I look forward to hearing the Minister&rsquo;s view on what  the necessary measures are; however, we want to hear that they involve more  than simply working with other organisations.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">While stressing that the Alliance Party welcomes the issue  being brought to the Floor of the Assembly, such motions do not look at the  overall recruitment difficulties in Northern Ireland. No discussion of  employment is complete without reference to the severe restrictions on labour  mobility that exist in Northern    Ireland due to sectarianism and segregation,  as noted by all businesses.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Too many areas of Northern Ireland &mdash; not only urban areas,  but suburban and rural areas as well &mdash; are, in practice, only accessible to  certain sections of the workforce. We cannot continue to tolerate a situation  whereby a hidden Berlin Wall means that people who live only a few miles away  from a certain locality feel that they cannot work in it. Until we tackle that  issue, the potential for indigenous businesses and outside investors will be  severely limited.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We cannot further restrict public- or private-sector  recruiters by limiting their flexibility in appointing staff. The Confederation  of British Industry estimates that as many as 2,000 positions could be at risk  if this motion is passed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Agency staff have an important role, often in more high-end  jobs than people think, offering specific skills, often at short notice, not  just to businesses but to public services. I have commented on the severe  restrictions imposed by segregation; we cannot afford to put our businesses and  public services at a further disadvantage to  those in neighbouring regions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some parts of the health and social services sector are  almost completely dependent on agency staff, and that must be reviewed.  Although we support the availability of flexible expertise to the public  sector, in most cases, agency staff are more costly. There is an efficiency  issue to be addressed there, as it is unclear whether agency workers offer  value for money in all cases. The issue from the employees&rsquo; point of view is  enforcement of the existing rights of agency workers, which may include better  information for those entering employment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  First, I echo some of the points that have  been made. The use of agency staff in our economy is essential to the flexible and smooth working  of many private firms and public bodies. Secondly, agencies cater for  the needs of specific groups of workers, some of whom want to return to the  workplace, but require flexibility, etc. However, that should not lead to a  diminution of the protection available to them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased that the motion has been tabled, but it  probably goes further than many Members would have wished. As I pointed out in  my earlier intervention, there are legal safeguards for agency staff, but we  must ensure that proper procedures and measures are in place to ensure that  those safeguards are adhered to. For many agency staff, it is their first time  in the workplace, and they may be unsure of their rights or not sure of their  way around the system that guarantees those rights. Therefore, we must ensure  that a body or service is established that they can contact if they have any  complaints.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I wanted to take part in this debate so that I could  address the fact that many of those who are employed by agencies in Northern  Ireland &mdash; and I suspect that this is also true of other parts of the United Kingdom  &mdash; do not even come from here in the first place. That has not been mentioned  today. It is very difficult for them to find out about the safeguards and their  rights and whom they can contact to seek  help on such issues.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Only last week, a group of Polish workers came into my  constituency office. They are employed by a company based in England called  People Resource, which they find difficult to contact. I have not been able to  contact the company either. It specifically targets Poland,  and supplies Polish workers to companies in Northern Ireland. One such business  to which it supplies workers is a distribution company based in Larne called  Wincanton plc, which services many of the major companies that operate here and  distributes goods on their behalf.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those workers are paid &pound;7 an hour, which is above the  minimum wage, and they get overtime earnings. However, there is an aspect of  agency work that has not been addressed: the agency, which undoubtedly makes a  good profit out of the workers whom they supply, provides accommodation that  the workers must sign up to before they come here. The workers who came to me  are paying &pound;1,200 a month in Larne to rent accommodation &mdash; a palace or an hotel  in Larne could be rented for that amount of money. The property is an ordinary  Housing Executive house, which &mdash; even if it were in the private sector &mdash; should  have a rental value of &pound;300 a month, yet those workers are paying four times  that amount.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">They must also use their wages to pay for electricity,  which comes to &pound;62 a month. I do not know how many light bulbs one would have  to turn on in order to spend that amount of money on electricity, but they have  to pay that amount. One of the workers broke his arm in work and was told that  he is not entitled to any sick pay, although deductions continue to be made  from his wages for rent, lighting, heating, and so on.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Here are figures from two of the best payslips that those  workers received: for a 40-hour week, one of them brought home &pound;132, which  amounts to just over &pound;3 an hour; and for a 42-hour week, another worker  received &pound;188, which comes to just over &pound;4 an hour. That is something that the  Assembly should be concerned about. It is important &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s time is almost up.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  The gangmaster legislation that applies to production should also apply to  distribution so that workers, such as the ones to whom I referred, are  safeguarded.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I,  too, congratulate the proposer of the motion for bringing this important issue  to the Assembly. Although I am broadly supportive of the gist of the motion, I  sound a few notes of caution.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is, of course, important that workers be treated fairly  and be afforded protection in their jobs, whether they are employed by an  agency or directly by an employer. As has been stated, agency staff play an  incredibly important role in our economy, and they should be treated fairly.  However, a key point is that agency workers are employed by an agency and not  the company for which they work. Although I want legislation that covers agency workers to be strengthened, which  has been the gist of the debate so far, I anticipate difficulties if every  agency worker were afforded the same benefits and advantages that are enjoyed  by permanent staff. The result would be a significant additional administrative  burden on businesses, particularly small  businesses. We must avoid creating circumstances in which so many  additional burdens are put on businesses that they no longer want to hire  agency workers, and, as a result, jobs are lost.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, it is important that agency workers are not  exploited by unscrupulous employers. As Mr Sammy Wilson said, exploitation is  particularly prevalent in cases that involve migrant workers. I know the case  to which the Member referred, having spoken to the young Polish man in Larne  who gained employment through an English agency with questionable motives. That  man told me about other people whom he knew who had gone to agencies that  proceeded to confiscate their passports, which is against the law. When agencies  break the law like that, the necessary steps must be taken to close them down.  However, I am not sure that an additional raft of legislation from Europe would stop such behaviour, because unscrupulous  agencies will disregard the law, irrespective of the legislation that exists.  Mr Spratt mentioned a specific case, and the employment practices of the firm  in question must be looked at very carefully.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Attwood talked about  the position of the Govern&shy;ment, and the UK  is among several economically developed  states, such as the Irish Republic, Germany  and Denmark,  to name a few, which resist the proposed EU legislation. It is interesting to hear what the agencies say, and the  chairman of Grafton Recruitment, James Kilbane, has said that the proposed EU  legislation would severely affect temporary workers in Northern Ireland.  He also said that those calling for such a change  lacked the necessary understanding of temporary work places, and the  lifestyle choice that it represents for millions of people. His point was that  temporary workers already enjoy equal rights with permanent workers in those  countries where the principle of temporary working is understood and practised  by workers and businesses alike.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I looked at the Department for Employment and Learning website,  and I listened to Mr McClarty going over some of the rights that exist. Those  include race and gender equality; fair employment; disability discrimination;  health and safety laws, and rights regarding  working time. Others are protected disclosure; the right for part-time  workers not to be treated less favourably than full-time workers; the minimum  wage; and rights concerning deductions from wages. It is important that the  measures that are already in legislation are enforced, and that we ensure that  agencies enforce them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Spratt spoke about the economy being a central point of  our draft Programme for Government and our draft Budget. It is important that  we examine what the CBI says about this proposed legislation. It, too, resists  the EU legislation, saying that it is important that the Government stand firm  against pressure from trade unions and the European Union, and that 250,000  placements across the UK  could be jeopardised if the EU directive were implemented. We heard that 58% of  employers here have warned that that law could lead to a significant reduction  in the use of temporary staff &mdash; staff who  are paramount in managing surges in demand.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Many people choose agency work as a way back into  employment, or because it offers them more flexibility. It is the case that  many of these agency workers can receive equal pay, or, indeed, better pay,  than some of their colleagues on permanent contracts, particularly in IT,  accounting and in some nursing jobs. In the context of today&rsquo;s speeches, it is  important to point that out. The CBI has figures that show that 67% of agency  workers earn as much as, or more than, colleagues on permanent contracts.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I am happy to support the Ulster Unionist  amendment. Much of the protection that Members have spoken about today exists;  it is simply a matter of ensuring that it is enforced. Nonetheless, the issue  must be investigated because, as has been highlighted, there are incidents of  behaviour that is not acceptable, in which workers are treated unfairly.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Your time is almost up.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s response, and to hearing of measures that he may  introduce to stamp out such incidents.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I  say at the outset that I hope that, at the end of this debate, agency workers  are better off, and I shall certainly listen with interest to the summings-up,  and to what the Minister has to say. That does not mean that I am against job agencies per se. Historically, those  organisations were used to give what were called &lsquo;temps&rsquo; an opportunity to put  their foot on the first step of the employment ladder, an opportunity to  undergo skills training and the like. That is fine, and the majority of those  workers went on to permanent jobs, where they were entitled to superannuation,  pensions and all the rest.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The difficulty is that, in recent times, with the  springing-up of many more agencies, and &mdash; as already mentioned &mdash; some of them  with doubtful intentions, the whole emphasis has changed. That is wrong, and it  is shameful. Among those involved in that exploitation are health trusts, local  councils &mdash; my own included, to my shame &mdash; and others, setting a very bad  example to the private sector. Saving money should never be the justification  for using agencies. It is wrong to circumvent the law by employing agencies  that have little legal responsibility for the people whom that they put forward  for what is termed &ldquo;casual&rdquo; or &ldquo;seasonal&rdquo; employment, only to find that nurses  have been in temporary employment for eight, 10, and, in one case, 12 years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Several references have been made to migrant workers, and  all Members know case studies of such workers. Mitchel McLaughlin mentioned  Seagate Technology. That firm recently released a press statement announcing  redundancies &mdash; only a week after 150 workers arrived in Limavady.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that all Members remember the young girl from Ukraine who  lost her lower limbs in one of the most shameful examples of exploitation. She  must live with her injuries and with the consequences of that event for the  rest of her life.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are more recent examples similar to that described by  Sammy Wilson. Recently, I had a visit from a young Polish girl &mdash; let me call  her Anna &mdash; who got injured in a factory. Her rights have expired and she has no  money: it could be years before a compensation claim is successful. She is  surviving and is being looked after by a Polish family who are receiving only  the minimum amount of money. It occurred to me that she could suffer a repeat  of what happened to the Ukrainian girl. I hope that I will be able to go home  this evening with the knowledge that I have contributed to a debate that will  improve the lives of migrant workers and our own people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">While the opportunity exists to discriminate against  people, unfortunately, there will be those who will make a living out of it.  The solution is to give all workers the same rights. In such circumstances, the  agencies that do a good job will survive &mdash; as they have done for many years &mdash;  and the others will go to the wall. In general terms, everyone will benefit,  because if employers treat their workers fairly and equally, they will get the  best service from them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not want to see a return to the hiring fairs of the  last century. I want that to remain in the history books; it is a bad dream  that must never be repeated. I want to see all workers respected as equals and  benefiting under the law.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  As someone who has not had to seek employment through an agency, I consider myself  fortunate. Almost weekly, I hear about the problems and difficulties faced by  agency workers in my constituency. They are not entitled to holiday pay or paid  sick leave and they are not entitled to redundancy payments if the firms for  which they are working close down. Furthermore, they may even receive a lower  level of pay than permanent workers who are employed by the same firm.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Not all employers and agencies are guilty of unfair  treatment towards their agency workers. However, when I hear about situations  in which workers are being treated unfairly, it makes me wonder how much we  value our workforce. We are living in the twenty-first century, and we are  supposed to be a modern and civilised society. However, if agency workers are  treated differently from full-time employees, it is a sign that we do not value  the contribution that they make to our economy. Instead, we penalise them  because they have been proactive in their search for employment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Employment agencies can be a useful tool for the employee  and the employer as they can match skills with opportunities &mdash; an arrangement  of benefit to both parties. However, that should not result in any agency  worker being treated differently in any respect. The Assembly is trying to  encourage and promote Northern Ireland plc globally. One way of doing that  would be to demonstrate to prospective investors that we value our greatest  asset &mdash; our workforce &mdash; and it means that agency workers must have the same  rights and responsibilities as other employees.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps equality is a term that is used and abused by some  people in Northern Ireland,  but for agency workers it will mean a substantial step towards addressing some  of the areas that I mentioned: holiday pay entitlement; sick leave; redundancy  payments; and equality of wages. I support the amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  A&rsquo;hm shair Ah&rsquo;m no the onie representative i the chammer the day at he shed a  constituent oan tae him wha bes distraught accause they hae bein pit ootae  thair waark wie nae pey, nae noatice an&rsquo; nae raison.

Surely thair bes laa i place at protects employees efter they hae  waarked thair probationary tim&rsquo;? Weel, this bes true bit no gif ye waark  through an agency. If thon bes the caase then nae matter the overtim&rsquo; ye hae  wrocht, ir hoo guid yer waark bes, ye can bae pit ootae waark wi&rsquo;oot noatice ir redundancy. This cannae bae  fair pley.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that I am not the only representative in the  Chamber who has been approached by a constituent who is distraught because  their employment has been terminated with no pay, no notice and no reason. I  have heard tales of people who worked for up to two years in a business &mdash; my  colleague Mr Spratt has heard of people who worked for up to nine years &mdash; only  to find themselves out of work. How can that be?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Surely there is legislation that protects employees after they have worked a probationary period.  Although that is the case to a certain extent, it is not so for people  who are employed through an agency. No matter what overtime those people put  in, the quality of their work or their time in a job, their employment can be  terminated without any notice or redundancy pay. That does not seem fair to me,  and I suspect that it does not seem fair to other Members.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department for Employment and Learning estimates that  over 300 businesses in the Province use agencies that supply temporary workers.  There are almost 15,500 people in that bracket, who either supply workers or  undertake temporary work themselves. That is a high percentage of people who  are not protected in the workplace, and the Minister for Employment and  Learning and his Department must examine the issue urgently.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have read the consultation document on temporary workers,  and I agree with many of the issues on which the  Department for Employment and  Learning is focusing. However, a  section of workers has been overlooked  &mdash; the people who are working long term in a temporary position, yet have the same rights as people who  have worked for a week. That is clearly unfair.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I know of girls who have worked in offices for over two  years, doing a job exceptionally well and even training new starts, only to  find that, at budget time, they are the first to go. It is ludicrous that  someone who has been in a position for 18 months should have to go before  someone who has been there only for a few weeks. That matter must be addressed,  because it is wrong.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I understand that the idea behind using temporary workers,  in some cases, is to allow for temporary expansion while the business is  assessed on how it will cope with extra expenditure. However, to retain someone  for two years with no rights is not in keeping with the principle of a  temporary worker.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I suggest that the Minister for Employment and Learning and  his Department consider the imposition of  an upper time limit on how long a worker can remain with a company  without gaining some rights. Those people who have worked for two, five or nine  years have mortgages, families, children, responsibilities and financial  commitments. Why should they not have the same rights and considerations? My  colleagues have already addressed other issues, so I will not dwell on them. I  thank all Members for their comments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although these workers are hired on a temporary basis, they  should have a reasonable expectation that their job is secure if they work long  term. That expectation must be enshrined in future legislation, and I urge the  Minister to include provisions for that when the consultation period closes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I support the amendment, and I thank the proposer of the  motion for accepting it.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning (Sir Reg Empey)</strong>: I welcome the opportunity to thank  the many Members who have contributed to the debate. Many Members spoke with  great sincerity, which indicates that consideration is being given to agency  workers and their rights, and the contribution that they make to the economy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The debate has been useful. Over the years, employ&shy;ment  agencies and businesses have made a significant and positive contribution to  the local economy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As has been mentioned, we estimate that about 300  employment agencies and businesses in the Province provide many permanent and temporary job opportunities. Some of  those organisations specialise in certain areas, so it is not the case that we  are dealing with 300 businesses and agencies that do exactly the same thing.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Let us be clear that there are benefits to agency work. It  is an important factor in creating a flexible labour market, and many  businesses consider it essential to better meet the demands of local and  international markets. It also allows companies to increase production on a  temporary basis before making a permanent commitment to expansion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Many workers choose agency work because of the  circumstances and the flexibility that it provides. Agency workers are also  important in meeting the seasonal needs of some employers &mdash; that point was  mentioned by Members across the Chamber. For some people, getting a job through  an agency is a gateway to permanent work. Others choose temporary work because  it allows them to better balance their work with other commitments. Agency work  can also appeal to some work seekers as it can offer them the opportunity to  learn new skills or try new jobs before permanently changing career.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A CBI survey in 2004 showed that 52% of agency workers  choose temping for positive reasons, such as increased flexibility, better pay,  or the fact that it allows them to gain work experience. The GB Labour Force  Survey 2006 showed that 26% of temporary agency workers do not want a permanent  position. In 2005, BMG Research showed that 77% of agency workers felt at least as valued as permanent  employees, and 2005 statistics from  the Recruitment and Employment Confederation have shown that 56% of  temporary agency workers are satisfied with their work.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We can argue about those statistics and take or leave them  as we please, but my point is that it is not all a black picture. As Anna Lo  said, many people are quite comfortable with what they are doing.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Statutory protection is a matter of concern for Members. I  recognise that agency workers are not provided  with the same statutory protections as directly recruited employees. However, to provide agency workers with  similar rights would undermine the flexibility that agency work brings. The  effect of introducing such rights would be that businesses would find it harder  to take advantage of opportunities. Such a move is potentially damaging to the  economy and to jobs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Flexibility for both the worker and the employer is one of  the features of agency work. Just as agency workers have the flexibility to  take up and leave jobs at short notice, employers also have the flexibility to  finish temporary work without being liable for unfair dismissal or redundancy  pay.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am aware that several Seagate Technology Ltd workers were contracted through employment  agencies; indeed, the Member who moved the motion referred to that. In  those circumstances, the workers are not entitled to redundancy payments, as  their contractual relationships are with the employment agency and not with  Seagate Technology Ltd. Most workers were on temporary contracts lasting less  than one year and would not have been entitled to redundancy payments in any event,  given that there is a two-year cut-off point that would have applied equally  had they been directly employed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Agency workers currently receive many of the same statutory  rights as permanent employees, including the national minimum wage, holiday  entitlement and statutory sick pay. The private recruitment sector in Northern Ireland is also regulated by the  Conduct of Employment Agencies and Employment Businesses Regulations (Northern Ireland)  2005. Those regulations put in place the minimum standards that work seekers  and hirers can expect.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am, however, not complacent about the regulation of the  agency part of the labour market. I will shortly introduce proposals to the  Assembly to amend the regulations in order to provide additional protections  for vulnerable work seekers. Before listing those protections, I will deal with  a couple of points that were made during the debate.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Spratt drew Members&rsquo; attention to several examples of  the abuse of agency working in the Civil Service. I intend to write to the  Minister of Finance and Personnel in order to draw those matters to his  attention. Clearly, we do not want to upset those individuals; however, I was  somewhat surprised by the length of time taken. From my experience in local  councils, I know that the same principles were beginning to feed into some  departments there; it was easy to fill places and not to follow up. I recollect  that time limits were applied in order to ensure that that could not happen.  Equally, we do not wish to put people out of work, but the matter must be  examined, and I will write to the Minister of Finance in order to follow up on  that point.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Dallat referred to the sad case of the young Ukrainian  woman. At the time, my party lobbied for her  to be given extraordinary leave to stay in the United Kingdom. That case was a dark day in Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  history on these matters, and it shocked the whole community. The Member asked whether we can be certain that that  could not happen again; it would be a brave person who would stand up and say  that it could not.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, following the recent events at Reid Transport, in  which several workers&rsquo; classifications were rather confused or uncertain, we  went out of our way to take steps concerning their welfare in order to ensure,  at least, that accommodation was available and that the authorities were  warned. We had the case of the Ukrainian woman in mind when that issue arose,  because if some of the employment practices had not been right, there might  have been &mdash; and probably were &mdash; people whose eligibility to work and rights in  this country were questionable, and who might have ended up on the street with  no money. I can assure Mr Dallat that, should there be any further unfortunate  developments in the field of employment, that will be one of the issues that we  will always address.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I propose to bring measures to the Assembly, including  giving workers the right to withdraw from additional services provided by an  agency, such as transport or accommodation, without suffering any detriment; providing  that workers must receive a written statement of their right to withdraw from  such services; and banning entertainment and modelling agencies from taking any  fees on the day of, or during, a casting session or offer to include a  work-seeker&rsquo;s details in a publication. In those circumstances, I intend that  workers will be given a seven-day cooling-off period in which to change their  minds. Obviously, that example is very specialised; however, it does cover a  surprisingly large number of workers.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  I am pleased with what the Minister has said. Will he give us a timetable for  implementing those new protections?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Sir Reg Empey</strong>:  I do not have a specific indicative timetable; however, it is fair to say that  we could proceed without too much difficulty in the course of this year. I do  not wish to be held to that &mdash; people are nodding in the Officials&rsquo; Box &mdash; but we  will probably be able to effect legislation this year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Further to those legislative changes, which will provide  additional protections for agency workers, officials will produce targeted  guidance for drivers, driver agencies and companies that use such agencies,  making it clear that agencies that employ drivers will breach legislation if  they fail to abide by any other applicable Northern Ireland legislation  governing drivers&rsquo; working excessive hours. That is a concern that people have  had, and it arose in the recent case of that company that went into  liquidation. There were concerns that people were driving for longer than they  were supposed to under national regulations.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Again, the restriction of driving time is a Europe-wide  issue, so the regulations must be written down and made specific.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will also be producing guidance on the cost of living in  the UK  for migrant workers to read before they leave their home countries. The example  that the Member for East Antrim Mr S Wilson gave us was shocking. For the sum  that he mentioned, a person could rent a house in Malone Park,  let alone in Larne. That was a case of exploitation at its worst.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My Department has the power to prosecute agencies in the  Magistrate&rsquo;s Court for breaches of the regulations. In the most severe cases,  the Department can apply to an industrial tribunal to prohibit an individual  from operating an agency for up to 10 years. Furthermore, the Department will  shortly issue a public consultation on proposed primary legislation to allow  serious cases to be tried either in the Magistrate&rsquo;s Court or in the Crown  Court. That would also allow for unlimited fines and the creation of attempted  offences.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members may be aware that, since 2002, there has been a  draft directive on temporary agency workers. As currently drafted, it would  provide agency workers with the same rights as directly recruited employees.  Member states continue to disagree about the best approach. The UK Government  support the underlying principles of the directive, but they are pushing for a  qualifying period before agency workers would achieve the rights. I will  continue to monitor developments on that directive, and I am happy to review Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  position when member states reach agreement on the way forward.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I have said, I am very conscious that Members feel very  strongly about the issue. However, the situation is not all doom and gloom.  Many people are very comfortable doing agency work. In many cases, it is better paid work. Individuals might have  commitments that require them to take time off &mdash; perhaps they are carers  &mdash; and specific work, such as that in IT or forensic accountancy, might suit  them better.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must be careful that, in trying to protect a  particularly vulnerable group, we do not use a sledgehammer to crack a nut. In  the proposals that I hope to bring forward next year, I will try to outline  more precision pieces of regulation and legislation that can weed out the  miscreants and the people who are genuinely exploiting workers without  destroying opportunities and making it difficult for those who want to work for  agencies and for those companies who benefit from them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, my Department is very aware of the issues,  and it is taking measures. I will come back to the Assembly with proposals, and  the Assembly will have an opportunity to deal with the detail of the legislation. In the meantime, the Department has  powers, and it is exercising them. It inspects agencies and will take  them to court if necessary. One particularly bad case has been taken to a  tribunal, and that is ongoing.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department is not sitting back and doing nothing; it is  working on the issues. As Mr Ross mentioned, there is material on the  Department&rsquo;s website, and it is publishing material to try to inform people of  their rights before they come here, so that they can avoid some of the  difficulties that have been mentioned.</p>
	      <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  The Ulster Unionist Party brought the amendment because the original motion, if  it were to be carried, would put us in line  with the draft proposals from the EU. However, that would put us out of  step with the law in the Republic of Ireland  and Great Britain.  It would also send a message to potential  inward investors and local investors that Northern Ireland is not a very  flexible place in which to do business.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My party is not, in any way, suggesting that there is no  requirement to protect agency workers from the situations that other Members  have described, but it is a question of getting the balance right.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are, indeed, a number of positive reasons why many  people enjoy working for agencies, some of which have been highlighted by the Minister  and other Members. One of the most compelling reasons is that it can be a  stepping stone to something better. During other debates, Members have  discussed almost the opposite of that: we have argued about the need to provide  work for teachers and to enable them to get one year of training which gives  them experience to help them to progress. There is a corollary in that. I  accept that, as has been said before, there may be dangers in that because it  is no good being a new teacher for seven years; sooner or later that experience  has to be transferred to real long-term employment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Other issues that affect the whole of society have to be  dealt with &mdash; for example, how companies forward-manage their workforce with  planned redundancies and so on. One of the biggest issues is the suggestion of  increased civilianisation of the police, which brings in different skills. I  say that having registered my interest as a member of the Policing Board. How  can such issues be managed sensitively and properly? Agency staff have their  part to play in that process.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I note that a number of colleagues from the SDLP were  worried about their consciences and about whether they would be able to leave  the Chamber feeling that they had done the right thing. It is important that we,  in the Assembly, get our house in order. Maybe someone can check how many  agency workers have been working for seven years as Doorkeepers in this fine  establishment. It is definitely more than one. That is an issue that we can  consider and lead by example on.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I was struck by Mr Sammy Wilson&rsquo;s contribution on migrant  workers. There is a danger that they could be exploited. Such issues need to be  properly investigated. That is one of the reasons for the Ulster Unionist  Party&rsquo;s amendment: the current entitlements need to be properly enforced. We  think, along with the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom, that we should have  significant qualifying periods for agency workers to ensure that the economy is  not damaged. It is important to get a balance when it comes to economic  competitiveness.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This is a bit like the argument that we had about the  minimum wage. Do we put it up because it is the right thing to do, or would it  be too high? Everything is finely balanced, like a cocktail. It is important to  ensure that no one aspect dominates the others. The danger with using a  sledgehammer to crack a nut &mdash; to borrow the simile that was used by the  Minister &mdash; is that it unbalances the system. We need to show that we are a  caring society, but that there is flexibility that enables us to run a  competitive economy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The final issue is that skills and training make a real  difference. That is why I was pleased to hear the Minister say that he plans to  produce proposals on this matter, which will be part of the Programme for  Government and which will tackle the real issues.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have listened to worthy contributions from all sides of  the House, and the Minister has taken a reasonable and proactive position. It  would send a good and powerful signal if the House could unite behind the  Ulster Unionist Party&rsquo;s amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank my colleague Mitchel  McLaughlin for tabling the motion. This has been a useful debate, and I thank the Minister for attending and for  responding to the contributions. I also thank all the Members who took  part; they all had a contribution to make.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In his opening address, Mitchel said that Sinn F&eacute;in would  accept the amendment put forward by the Ulster Unionist Party.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">At the outset of the debate, Mitchel McLaughlin highlighted  that there are almost 600 employment agencies on this island; therefore it is  important that we take all necessary measures to protect agency workers. With  that in mind, I am sure that the Committee for Employment and Learning will  support any measure that strengthens the position of agency workers. On behalf  of the Committee, I will make two points; then I will speak as a private  Member.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee recently  agreed several work streams that it will concentrate on in its programme  of work. One is vulnerable persons in the  learning and employment environment. That group includes migrant  workers, who are more likely to be employed by agencies. The Committee wishes  to see only the highest standards of employment practices upheld and looks  forward to the Department&rsquo;s strategy on that group of workers. The Department  is to bring a strategy for migrant workers to the Committee at the end of  February.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister mentioned  several issues but highlighted that,  at its meeting last week, the Committee considered legislation concerned  with agency workers, namely the Conduct of  Employment Agencies and Employment Businesses (Amendment) Regulations  2007. The Committee unanimously supported those regulations, which are designed  primarily to protect workers in the entertainment and modelling industries. The  Minister said that he will submit them to the Assembly for affirmative  resolution soon. I thank him for that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As several Members pointed out, agency work enables people  to work across a range of areas in various European countries; it can offer  flexibility and a way back into the labour market. It can also provide  businesses with a flexible response to their need for staff, which is often the  case for small and medium-sized businesses. We recognise and support that need,  but it cannot be met at the cost of the rights and protection of workers.  Temporary agency workers are often the most vulnerable and are usually found in  lower-paid jobs, particularly in catering, call-centre and care sectors.  Compared to those in permanent employment, agency workers lose out on pay,  holidays and entitlement to family-friendly rights such as maternity and  paternity leave. They can often be excluded from training.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Alex Attwood mentioned a recent TUC (Trades Union Congress)  survey that found that agency workers can be in an organisation for long  periods and yet be described as casual and viewed as not committed to the  organisation. There has been a substantial growth in the number of agency  workers, and although I recognise employers&rsquo; need for flexibility, they should  not be able to employ workers with lesser rights &mdash; particularly rights of  redundancy and dismissal.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In his opening remarks, David McClarty said that the original motion would send out the wrong  message; I disagree. However, as Sinn F&eacute;in seeks to send out a clear and  positive message that the Assembly supports the rights of all workers,  including agency workers, my party has agreed to accept the amendment. David  went on to say that 67% of agency workers receive equal or higher pay than  permanent staff: that might be correct, but what of the 33% that do not receive  it? We have a duty to protect them. For the record, the trade union movement  disputes that statistic.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In his contribution, the Deputy Chairperson of the  Committee for Employment and Learning agreed with the original motion. I agree  with him that Members will not leave today with all the answers. However, the  motion calls on the Minister to take the necessary steps and I am sure that the  Committee will have a positive role to play.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Anna Lo said that the original motion goes too far. In my  view, however, legislation to protect the rights of workers &mdash; whether permanent  or agency &mdash; cannot go far enough.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sammy Wilson, as usual, brought clarity to the debate, and  I thank him for the statistics that he provided. He is correct in asserting  that agency staff are essential. Most agencies &mdash; as Mitchel McLaughlin pointed  out in his opening remarks &mdash; provide adequate protection for staff, but some do  not. Mr Wilson pointed out that although agency workers have rights, some are  unaware of them &mdash; we need to change that. There is no point in their having  rights unless they know about them. The Minister pointed out that we need to  ensure that the rights of agency staff are enforced by the relevant agencies. I  look forward to the Minister introducing that proposal.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Alastair Ross made the point that agency workers are  employed by an agency rather than a company. Mr Ross is absolutely correct.  However, it would be remiss of me were I not to point out that companies should  not be allowed to turn a blind eye to bad practice when they become aware of  it. They have a duty to report such practices.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">John Dallat, George Robinson and Jim Shannon made valid  points about issues that have arisen in their constituencies. That highlights  the fact to me that mistreatment of agency workers affects all of our  constituencies; not just one or two. It happens right across the board, and  Members are having to deal with those problems daily.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister pointed out that there are benefits from  agency work: no one would disagree. All Members who have spoken have  highlighted and accepted that positive work is being done by agencies and by  the individuals who wish to be involved with them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Basil McCrea raised the issue of staff in this Building. I  commend the Minister, and I will support him in his pledge to write to the  Minister of Finance and Personnel on the matter. Members hear stories daily  about staff who are directly, or indirectly, associated with the Building and  who could be mistreated. Mr McCrea said that there could be exploitation. The  fact is that exploitation has already occurred and changes must be made.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with Mitchel McLaughlin that the Assembly must, in  co-operation with the trade union movement, commit to the implementation of  measures that will protect the rights of agency workers. The Assembly&rsquo;s aim is  to support and encourage businesses while ensuring that workers are fully  protected and have equal rights. I support the amendment.</p>

	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Apprenticeships in Foyle</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The proposer of the debate will have 10 minutes in which to speak.  Depending on how many other Members wish to speak, they will each have  approximately eight minutes. The Minister will speak for the last 10 minutes of  the debate.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the opportunity to speak  on the important subject of apprenticeships. During a visit to FG Wilson in  December 2007 the Minister for Employment and Learning, Sir Reg Empey,  described apprentices as the lifeblood of the economy: I could not agree with  him more. However, that lifeblood is being drained from my constituency, Foyle,  because of the concentration of apprenticeship training that is being located  away from the region.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In recent years, many of the major level 3 training  programmes have been lost to Derry. For  example, the contract to provide electrical training was awarded to a company  in Ballymena; plumbing training was awarded to a company in Belfast; and mechanics and motor-vehicle  training was awarded to a company that is now based at Mallusk.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When the contract for mechanics and motor-vehicle training  was awarded, the successful company, Carter and Carter Group plc, did not even  have premises in the North of Ireland. Does the Minister believe that Carter  and Carter Group plc is in a better position to deliver mechanics and  motor-vehicle training than the North    West Regional College, which was unsuccessful in its  bid? I appreciate that the decision was made during direct rule. However, the Minister  has a responsibility to confront the ongoing legacy that such decisions have  created.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In particular, he must deal with the deeply concerning  issue of Carter and Carter Group plc. I draw his attention to an article that  appeared in the &lsquo;Guardian&rsquo; newspaper in December 2007, which reported that the  company faces debts of more than &pound;130 million and that an auditor is  investigating the falsification of its records.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Is that really the type of company with which we should  entrust the future of our young people? In order to prevent that from ever  happening again, there must be a fundamental review of the procurement process  that is used in the Department&rsquo;s Training for Success scheme. Furthermore, I  and my party colleague Raymond McCartney have already written to the  Comptroller and Auditor General to ask him to investigate the procurement  process which allowed that to happen.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Is the Minister in a position to publish the report that  was commissioned by his Department into the impact on north-west school-leavers  of the pilot scheme that is run by a Ballymena electrical training company? I  am sure that if he has the report, he will publish it &mdash; Members would like to  learn about it. That scheme informed much of current policy. However, we are  still to see the details of that report, despite previous assurances that it  would be available in April 2007. It would be welcome if the delivery of that  report could be speeded up.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Action is needed now. Otherwise, ever more vital training  programmes will be lost to areas such as Derry,  while the future of ever more of our young people could be placed in the hands  of companies such as Carter and Carter Group plc.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is no doubt that the Department&rsquo;s Training for  Success programme has the potential to deliver for the young people of the  North. However, it must deliver for them all, and not just for the few. As part  of the Stand Up for Derry campaign, I have argued for an end to the neglect  that the north west  has endured for so many decades. For too long, the young people of my city have  been denied an equal right to employment. Are we now also to deny them the  right to training?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The young people of my city desperately want to work. They  want to learn and to secure apprenticeships as a means of securing a better  future for themselves and their families. How can they do that if they are  forced to travel to Belfast,  Ballymena or anywhere else in the North on a trainee&rsquo;s wage? That is  impossible.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The draft Programme for Government and investment strategy  commits the Executive to creating 6,500 new jobs by 2011 and delivering &pound;18  billion of investment during the next decade. Those are laudable aims. However,  those jobs and that investment must be for the benefit of all of the people who  reside in the North. That means that all young people should have equal access  to apprenticeship training. After all, it is they who will build the better  future that we want to see. We in the Chamber are merely laying down the  foundations for that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive have also committed themselves to eradicating the scandal of fuel poverty and, in  particular, child poverty, by 2012. Again, those are laudable aims. It  is the responsibility of all Departments to play their part in achieving those  aims. However, nowhere is the problem of child poverty more acute than in my  constituency. In Derry, 36% of children are  living in poverty, compared to the North&rsquo;s average of 24%. The highest child  mortality rate is also in the Western Health and Social Services Board area. Derry has the highest proportion of young people who  leave school without any qualifications.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The people of my city, particularly the young, have been  failed for generations. They must not be failed by the current Executive, or  the Assembly, any longer. In this new dispensation, we have the opportunity to  reverse the failures of the past. Unless we constructively address issues such  as the provision of apprenticeships, we will continue to fail the people,  particularly the young people, of Derry. We  will also fail to achieve the goals that have been set out in the draft  Programme for Government.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, I repeat my plea to the Minister to stand up for  the young people of Derry and for all our  young people. I urge him to give them a chance at the better future that each  and every one of them deserves. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>: I  congratulate Martina Anderson on securing this debate on a very important  issue. It is important to consider not just the Foyle constituency, because the  platform on which the Training for Success policy has been pursued is giving  rise to serious issues elsewhere. The problems are most acutely felt and  demonstrated in the north-west, particularly because of the switch in the  Electrical Training Trust (ETT) contract. Approaching private firms to provide  training &mdash; supposedly in the name of producing employer-led apprenticeship  schemes as opposed to the earlier models &mdash; will result in uneven access to  apprentice&shy;ship opportunities. Uneven access means unequal opportunities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The decline in numbers, not just in Derry  but in other districts, is apparent from the figures &mdash; particularly the ETT  figures. Since the introduction of the new format there has been a significant  reduction in the numbers undertaking electrical training apprenticeships. A  clustering effect is evident: apprenticeships doughnut around providers. There  is a fireside effect: the closer people are to the fire, the more heat they  feel; those further away feel the draught. That creates inequality. That is a  problem, not just for the young people who are looking forward to  apprenticeships, but also for training providers who have supplied effective  and efficient high-performance training and apprenticeships in the past, not  least, as Martina Anderson said, the North    West Regional College, formerly the North West  Institute.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It also creates problems for employers and firms. We must  remember that electricians, electrical technicians, plumbers and mechanics have  not only learnt their trade and become employees, they have often become  self-employed. They in turn often form their own companies and employ others. A  significant drop in the numbers taking up apprenticeships &mdash; almost to the point  of extinction &mdash; will have a knock-on effect. There will be a shortage of  self-employed people and fewer companies being created in certain areas. Those  areas will have fewer firms that can compete  for subcontracts in public or private procurement projects, never mind  the main contracts. Multiple inequality issues arise.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I accept that this policy began before devolution was  restored, but if the Department&rsquo;s emphasis is supposed to be on employer-led  schemes, what happens in areas that do not have significant numbers of  employers or where firms are not large enough to meet the criteria for  employer-led schemes? Firms in those areas cannot participate in apprenticeship  schemes, and young people in those areas are denied the opportunity to join  those schemes. In the name of employer-led schemes, the Department must take  account of the scale and capacity of employers and where they are located; it  must introduce schemes that meet their needs. That approach would be fairer to  them, to their areas and to the young people who live in those areas.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department for Employment and Learning must move  quickly on this matter. We have waited a long time while reviews and studies  have been carried out. I do not blame the Minister; I understand that the work  has not been completed. However, an appraisal of the impact of the switch in  the Electrical Training Trust contract case has been a long time coming, as has  an examination of the wider equality implications. The Department should not go  any further down that road until it is able to say that it knows what has  happened and why, and has corrective plans.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Employ&shy;ment and Learning (Ms S Ramsey)</strong>: Go raibh maith  agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I congratulate and commend Martina Anderson for  securing this debate. Although the  Committee for Employment and Learning has  been examining the general issue of apprenticeships, it has not  specifically considered the situation in the Foyle constituency or the wider  north-west area. The Minister will probably  refer later to a report commissioned from  PricewaterhouseCoopers, &lsquo;Modern Apprenticeships in the North West: Understanding  Demographics/Trends to Date and Forecasting Future Scenarios&rsquo;. That is a long  title, but I wanted to read it into the record. The report has been finalised  in the past few weeks, but, for the record, I and other Committee members  received it only yesterday, and I have not had a chance to examine it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is enormous interest among Members in the subject of  apprenticeships, as evidenced by this debate and a motion to be proposed next  week by Jim Shannon on the broader issue of apprenticeships in manufacturing.  My Committee is considering the issue through the monitoring of the  Department&rsquo;s Training for Success programme, which has replaced Jobskills. We  are examining the early roll-out of the programme, and we will report our  findings to the Assembly after the Easter recess.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">To date, the Committee has focused on assessing  departmental views on the roll-out of the programme. We are now moving to the  critical phase of establishing sectoral feedback. Tomorrow, the Committee will  take evidence from the engineering and utility sectors. Next week, we are due  to hear from representatives of the construction sector. Their evidence will be  crucial to our inquiry, because they have already been quite vocal about the  problems that have arisen with the apprenticeships.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I urge Members who have an interest in this subject to keep  an eye on the Committee&rsquo;s agenda. As I said, the Committee will make its formal  report on the issue as soon as its monitoring of the Training for Success  programme has been completed. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  My party is no stranger to the subject of this debate; our party leader has  been working with the local victims since the beginning of this saga.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Employer-led schemes have had a primary role in the  equation for many years. However, the current situation begs many questions.  The North West Regional College has been synonymous with thousands of  young men and women who took up vocational apprenticeships in order to equip  themselves with a trade from which to make a living. Now, however, all that has  been stripped away from the college, which is well-equipped and well-prepared  to train young people, and which has a proven track record.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The college has made  major investments in premises and equipment to allow it to deliver  training of the highest standard. Nevertheless, a company that had not met any  of the required criteria was awarded a contract by Departments headed by direct  rule Ministers. That company has no staff or premises in Northern Ireland, let alone Derry.  I understand that, at one stage, it had aspirations to buy Blackwater House, a  training company based in Mallusk, so I can only assume that aspirations beat  physical actualities when it comes to awarding the criteria points that  ultimately win contracts. That situation must be reassessed; our city deserves  better, and our young people deserve better opportunities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When the shirt factories in Derry  closed down, training programmes were introduced in order to help people to get  on in life and learn another trade. That is not happening as it should, and the  situation must be re-examined. We await the result.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  Like Mark Durkan, I commend Martina Anderson for securing the debate, and I  welcome the Minister for Employment and Learning.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Talking to young people in Derry  who are around school-leaving age can be a tremendous boost. They have an  uplifting wit, imagination and optimism. In most cases, our young people have  enjoyed their schooling and have benefited from the hard work that people from  the community sectors have done, such as providing local youth clubs. The city  is bursting with a willingness to learn. Previous parliamentary questions show  that self-funded night classes at Magee   College are rapidly  developing, particular in technology-related subjects. There is a thirst in the  city for success and to get ahead.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, for many school leavers, progress is very  difficult, despite their optimism. Ideally, school leavers who do not want to go into academic study should  have the opportunity to begin serving their time in compre&shy;hensive,  internationally recognised apprenticeship schemes.  Their disappointment, loss of place in society, and the barriers that  prevent many of our young people from contributing can create terrible  frustration, resentment and disillusionment. Every town and city in the North will witness young people who have no  stake in society drifting towards drink and trouble. Many young people  do not know how to become adults because they are disconnected from their role  models.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Everyone should be able to excel in activities that allow  them to earn a living. That is the natural way of things, and we must recreate  the circumstances that allow that to happen. Traditionally, people were  encouraged to learn skills; it was their duty to become the best that they  could so that they could contribute to their community and earn a living. Since  the industrial revolution, an apprenticeship-led scheme was the rite of passage  from childhood to adulthood for many people. Not only could young people learn  job skills, but they learned how to be an adult. We must get back to basics and  build properly resourced Government training centres, where people can  undertake one or two years of rigorous training. I am confident that, after  such training, those people would be snapped up by employers who could put  their skills to much more productive use.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The current apprenticeship training system has been of  great concern to the SDLP. As Mary Bradley mentioned, our colleague Mark Durkan  has asked questions on the subject in the House and, prior to devolution, in  the House of Commons. The system is wasteful; it excludes those who are from  areas of high unemployment and those who are over the age of 24.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Change should take place in three areas. First, the current  practice of outsourcing training is a barrier. In some cases, training is  outsourced from either first- or third-year apprenticeships to suppliers that  often are not even local companies. It is difficult to understand the point in  giving business to a private company that is not from Northern Ireland,  given that it will then subcontract our regional colleges to do the same work.  Why are we throwing our money away? I reiterate Martina Anderson&rsquo;s point that  the North West Regional College  was overlooked in its bid to provide training schemes. Almost &pound;1 million was  invested in a mechanical engineering workshop at that college, but it is now  lying dormant. It is a crying shame because that centre of excellence could be  used in a much more productive way for young people. I ask the Minister to  comment on what future use will be made of that workshop for our young people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, the insistence that apprentices have an employer  mitigates high levels of unemployment in regions that have a low economic activity  base. However, that rule not only disadvantages individuals, but exacerbates  the shortage of those skills that are necessary for new business and new  product develop&shy;ment. That is the reason that it is important to build a  network of Government training centres. I declare an interest as I served my  time in the 1970s as an apprentice in some of the training centres in Derry, which provided both excellent work and the  opportunity for people to develop skills that they would not otherwise have  had. Such centres can fast-track apprenticeship courses through intensive  training schemes that are similar to the successful models of the 1970s and  1980s.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Thirdly, why is there an age limit of 24 to qualify for  Training for Success? Why should an unemployed person of 25 or older not be  facilitated in learning how to be a bricklayer or a plumber, or whatever he or  she wants to be? There should be no artificial age limit.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those three barriers are artificial, and, through our  institutions, we should remove them. If we can get properly funded Government training schemes operating, allowing  people of all ages to participate and without the prerequisite of needing to be  employed &mdash; as is the case for school leavers and people who are long-term  unemployed &mdash; we can make inroads into renewing economies and transforming lives  and communities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly can raise the heads of young people so that  they retain their optimism after leaving school. By doing so, the Assembly can  re-engage with an entire section of society that feels excluded.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I call on the Minister for Employment and Learning to  engage in a partnership approach with employers and unions to ensure that all  young people, no matter where they are from, have an opportunity to take up  proper apprenticeships. That will give them a chance to move from childhood to  adulthood while still fully engaged with society. I also ask the Minister to  ensure that retraining through apprenticeships is available to people at any  stage of their careers.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning (Sir Reg Empey)</strong>: I thank Members who arranged and  participated in today&rsquo;s Adjournment debate. I want to deal with a couple of  matters before replying to the debate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Ramsey mentioned that the North West Regional   College is not currently  in use. I will look into that matter and  write to the Member in due course. Mr Durkan raised the issue of the  &ldquo;doughnut&rdquo; or clustering effect of apprenticeships. My Department will look out  for evidence of that as it assesses how the Training for Success programme is being rolled out. I listened  carefully to what he said on the subject.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member who tabled the subject for debate and all  Members who spoke today are clearly concerned lest  the area that they represent becomes disadvantaged. The background to,  and context of, the current situation is that it is an inherited arrangement.  It arose largely because of the report by the Select Committee on Northern  Ireland Affairs that severely criticised the Jobskills programme. Among the  many criticisms was the fact that employers were exploiting the workers by  using them for 12 months before dumping them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The procurement process is run through the Depart&shy;ment of  Finance and Personnel&rsquo;s Central Procurement Directorate.  People have asked whether it was necessary for the Carter and Carter  Group plc to have premises before starting the training programmes. The answer,  under the procurement rules, is no. I, and many others, asked the question.  Everything was done in accordance with DFP rules, and the Carter and Carter Group  plc was not the only company in that position.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I recap on the debate, I hope to pick up most of the  points that have been made. I will try to catch up later on anything that I  miss.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My Department is totally committed to apprentice&shy;ships,  which constitute the main vehicle that supports business, industry, employers  and the economy. Every year, apprenticeships help many young people to move  from education into the world of work. Pat Ramsey made a good point about adult apprenticeships. However, the  financial dimension must be considered. The Department wants to provide many  more apprentice&shy;ships and is currently considering what can be done, but the  recent comprehensive spending review has had an impact on spending. However,  the Department is aware of the issue of adult apprenticeships because many  people have highlighted it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Apprenticeships provide people with training to develop the  technical skills and knowledge that they and their employers need. The type and  number of apprentices who need to be trained each year will be determined by  the demand from business and industry. The responsibility is not exclusive to  the Department: employers must also have a role. They must invest in  apprentices, and they must understand that there is a link between helping  young people to progress and enjoying long-term success as companies. Some  companies tend to hope that an apprentice will turn up on a given day and that  the Government will provide his or her training. I am sorry, but the employers  must play their part.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the past year, my Department spent &pound;51 million on  vocational training, &pound;12 million of which was specifically dedicated to  supporting young apprentices and their employers. The balance of the money was  used to prepare young people for work and to help them progress to training as  apprentices, because some required basic, essential skills before their  apprenticeships could begin.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Health and safety is a major issue that must be dealt with  before apprentices can work in certain sectors, particularly in construction.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Over the past few years, the Department&rsquo;s flagship training  scheme &mdash; Jobskills &mdash; received a poor press, and I refer to that because of the  Westminster Public Accounts Committee&rsquo;s report of 2005. The new training  product responds largely to that report. We have our differences about the  degree to which we might have responded, and the manner in which we would have  responded, but we are where we are. Training for Success offers a new approach  to skills training, ensuring that people are actually employed. Skills training  is at the heart of what is on offer.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The apprenticeship programme remains virtually untouched.  It was working well, and there was no need to change it. Indeed, we have built  on its sound foundations and enhanced it with the introduction of level 2  apprenticeships.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department has set itself the challenging target of  having 10,000 apprentices on the programme by 2010. Last year, more than 6,000  people joined the programme, and the indications are that this year&rsquo;s intake &mdash;  although down a little on last year &mdash; will increase significantly, year on  year, as the new provision beds in. However, the numbers that enter  apprenticeships are entirely determined by employers. It is they who employ  apprentices and offer them the opportunity to train. The introduction of  training provision is required to renew contracts for the delivery of training  by further education colleges and other training organisations. The Department  is required to comply with Government accounting and procurement procedures,  under strict guidance from the Department of Finance and Personnel&rsquo;s  procurement directorate. The tendering process was completed in May 2007.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am aware of the concerns that have been raised about the  apparent decline in apprenticeships in the Foyle area. My officials have met  with public representatives and council officials to discuss apprenticeships and to hear concerns about the  contracts awarded to the Electrical Training Trust and, more recently,  to Carter and Carter Group plc. The Electrical Training Trust is by far the  most successful scheme. It has an 85% success rate, which is top of the line.  Some Members are concerned that its headquarters are in Ballymena, but it is  not necessary for the courses to be held there. The examinations are held  there, and they take about three days. If there is sufficient demand in the  city, and if at least 12 people wished to take the course, training could take  place there.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a particular issue about the numbers of trainees  at the moment, but, as the Member for Foyle Mr Durkan has said, in previous  times the city was well ahead. Its figures are still above average, but in that  particular discipline it is not doing so well. However, that can be remedied.  The college could provide training on its premises in the city if there were  enough trainees &mdash; probably more than 12 would be sufficient.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On a regional basis, the north-west has experienced some of  the lowest levels of apprenticeships, but Foyle has one the highest levels. Up  to 2002-03, the four-year funded route, that  is, the achievement measurement 2 (AM2) skill test, has been running at  double the Northern Ireland  average. Although that figure has declined since 2003, it is still above the Northern Ireland  average.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Reference has been made to a study that was carried out by  PricewaterhouseCoopers. A copy of that report will be placed in the Library  today, so that Members can study it and make their own determinations. I am  monitoring the Carter and Carter Group plc situation on almost a daily basis.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Education and Training Inspectorate is in constant  contact with providers in order to monitor the standards of the contracts as  they are implemented, and that applies in  this case. I can confirm that the Department has prepared contingency  plans in the event of there being any specific difficulty with Carter and  Carter Group plc. Although its shares have been suspended, it is still a  legally trading company and is still honouring its contracts. The Department  can act only if the company defaults on those contracts. The report is in the  Assembly Library, and I ask Members to read it to see whether they feel that it  contains sufficient information to make a judgement.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department is  totally committed to the apprentice&shy;ship model, is looking closely at  adult retraining and is fully aware of the concerns that exist in Foyle. I  assure Members that my Department&rsquo;s task, and that of the Education and  Training Inspectorate in advising us, is to ensure that standards are high, and  are maintained high, everywhere in Northern Ireland, which, of course,  includes Foyle.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">Adjourned at 4.56 pm.</p>
