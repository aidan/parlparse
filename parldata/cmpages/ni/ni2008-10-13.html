	    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 12.00 noon (Mr Speaker in the  Chair).</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
	    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="1"></a>Matters of the Day</p>
	    <p class="H4StageHeading">Stevenson and Company, Cullybackey</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Mr Mervyn Storey has sought leave to make a statement on a matter that fulfils  the criteria set out in Standing Order 24. I shall call Mr Storey to speak for  up to three minutes on the subject. I will then call other Members from the  constituency of North Antrim, as agreed with  party Whips. Those Members will also have up to three minutes in which to  speak. There will be no opportunity for interventions, for questions or for a  vote on the matter. I will not take any points of order until the item of  business has been concluded. If that is clear, we shall proceed.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Members will have seen on television, or read in news reports over the weekend,  of the proposed closure of Stevenson and Company, who are pork processors in  Cullybackey in my North Antrim constituency.  The business has been in operation since 1850 and has been located at the  Cullybackey site since the 1980s. It had previously been located, and had its  genesis, in Ballymoney.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Such a closure would be a blow at any time, but, in the  current economic climate, it will be a major blow, not only for North Antrim  but for the entire Northern    Ireland pig industry. Recently, the costs of  producing food have risen sharply. Trading costs for the Stevenson plant have  risen by more than &pound;4,500 a week; electricity costs have risen by around 40%;  and the cost of oil has risen by around 37%. Indeed, businesses in Northern Ireland have the highest electricity  costs of anywhere in the United    Kingdom. Although a larger company may be  able to absorb those costs for a longer time, small processors such as  Stevenson&rsquo;s simply cannot bear that kind of cost.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I have had discussions today with Mr Hamill and other  representatives from the company, and also with the Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment, Arlene Foster. I appreciate the time that she gave to the  company this morning to facilitate that meeting.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has assured me that if her Department can do  anything to help the company, it will do so. We, alongside our colleagues in  the House and the constituency, will continue to do all that we can to ensure  that all the options for the future are considered. I hope that all is not  lost, and I am certainly doing all that I can to find an alternative way  forward.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that I speak for all sides of the House when I say  that our thoughts are with those people who face the prospect of job losses at  this particularly worrying time. For families, the situation is immensely  stressful. Many of the families affected live in the immediate vicinity of the  plant, but others live further afield, too.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">We should also be concerned about the wider effects on the  pig industry in Northern    Ireland. At a time such as this, I would  have thought that the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development would be  prepared to meet with her Executive colleagues. Unfortunately, her party&rsquo;s  priorities seem to lie elsewhere. The devolution of any other issue, or the  consideration of any other political matter, is cold comfort to the families in  my North Antrim constituency who face the  prospect of job losses. I hope that such events will help to focus everybody&rsquo;s  minds, time and talent on the realities that face Northern Ireland.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank Mr Storey for bringing this issue  to the Assembly&rsquo;s attention. I echo his comment that the news of the proposed  closure of Stevenson and Co is devastating, not only for North   Antrim, but for the pig industry as a whole. Utmost in our minds  are those families who will be so badly affected by its closure, particularly  in the run-up to Christmas.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The company has announced that it may close as a result of  rising overheads, and we are all well aware of the recent huge increases in the  price of electricity and oil. The Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union  has highlighted the problem that is facing not only producers, but farmers: the  cost of producing food is rising dramatically. Farm produce, such as pork, is  being sold at a discount in the supermarkets in reaction to the credit crunch  that consumers are facing. However, there is not enough revenue to cover the  farmers&rsquo;, or, indeed, producers&rsquo; costs.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The announcement that the company is to close is clearly  devastating for those who live in its immediate vicinity. However, it should  also sound a warning bell to other players in the pig industry and to farmers  in general. We must take cognisance of that fact. I am sure that all Ministers,  including the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment and the Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development, will consider the situation and do their  utmost to help those affected by it. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert  Coulter</strong>: I congratulate Mr Storey for bringing this matter to the House.  The current credit crunch has taught us a great many lessons that we would  perhaps have preferred not to learn; chief among them being the fact that it is  nearly always preferable to keep an enterprise open than to close it down. I  deeply regret the proposed closure of Stevenson and Co, a very old firm that  has done so much for the economy of mid-Antrim for so many years. The company  has weathered many an economic storm: there have been many times when it found  it difficult to carry on, but it always did so, until now.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I have learnt from conversations with the firm&rsquo;s managers  that the business was not brought to crisis point by one single issue; rather  many economic pressures have led to this conclusion. I am also very sorry that  the closure will happen in the mouth of Christmas, as Mr McKay said. I fully  understand the reasons behind the firm&rsquo;s decisions, and the firm and its workers  have my deepest sympathy as they face this crisis.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">We must all work together &mdash; this is not a time for one  person or one party to be left to carry the burden. There must be an urgent  reassessment of the margins for pig producers because the firm&rsquo;s closure will  have a domino effect. In addition to the firm&rsquo;s owners, management and workers,  it will affect farm workers, families and local shops.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The standard reaction of people to whom I have spoken in  the last few days &mdash; in person and on the telephone at my home and office &mdash; is a  lack of confidence in the Assembly. To put it bluntly, they are asking whether  we are going to continue to make a pig or an ass of ourselves while people go  to the wall. It is time for us to be realistic and to work together for the  benefit of our people.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  thank Mr Mervyn Storey for bringing this matter to the attention of the  Assembly. I assure him that his words about the unfortunate likely total  closure of the Stevenson factory in Cullybackey have the support of the entire  Assembly. The serious concerns that have been raised are about the 100 jobs  that could be lost, the hardship for those individuals and their families, and  the economic blow to the local area due to the loss of wages and salaries.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">As has been said, among the reasons for the closure is the  serious rise in energy costs. Indeed, that is a worry for the entire industrial  sector. In addition to the direct consequences of the closure for the factory&rsquo;s  workers, management and owners, there are serious consequences for local pig  farmers who will not necessarily be able to find alternative outlets for their  produce. That is a great worry.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I encourage all the agencies that have a role in the  orderly rundown of the Stevenson plant &mdash; and all those who can make a  contribution to the economic continuity of the agricultural sector, and other  sectors in that area &mdash; to do everything that they can to help in a very  difficult situation.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Ian  Paisley</strong>: I am sure that all of us are worried about the proposed closure of  the Stevenson plant in the Ballymena area. However, it is a proposed closure. I  am glad that representations to the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment are continuing, and it may be that the company can be sustained  under a different ownership.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Members should do everything in their power to prevent the  closure of the Stevenson factory, and I believe that Members for North Antrim will make that effort. It would be a good  victory for us all if the plant were kept open. That would provide  encouragement to every part of the constituency and, indeed, to every part of Northern Ireland.  There is unity among the representatives of the area and those from outside. I  trust that today&rsquo;s short debate will help the situation.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Member of Parliament for the area, I will push as  hard as I possibly can to achieve the continuation of the factory, albeit under  different management. The present management is very keen for the factory to be  saved; there is no selfishness in their minds or hearts. That is a good thing,  because only a united approach can save the factory. I hope that this debate is  heeded by the powers that be, and that the decision will be changed.</p>
	    <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">A word of warning &mdash; in the present situation there will be  more bad news such as this. The economy is bankrupt. Without a change of  attitude, all the mending skills in the world will not alter that. Everybody  must co-operate as much as possible, in unity, in order to stave off disaster.</p>

	    <p class="H4StageHeading">Community Use of Schools Premises Bill</p>
	    <p class="H4StageHeading">First Stage</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I beg to introduce the Community Use of Schools Premises Bill [NIA 1/08], which  is a Bill to make provision for community use of school premises.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Bill passed First Stage and ordered to be printed.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Bill will be put on the list of future business until a date for its Second  Stage is determined.</p>
	    <p class="H5StageHeading" style="margin-top:34.0pt;"><a name="3"></a>Regulation of Private  Landlords</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I remind Members of the requirements of Standing Order 69 in relation to the  declaration of any interest relevant to a debate.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The Business Committee agreed, at its meeting on Tuesday 7  October, that, where two or more amendments to a motion are selected, an extra  15 minutes will be added to the length of the debate. The basis for that  decision was to ensure that other Members who wished to be called were not unduly  impacted upon by the time taken to move and wind up multiple amendments. Up to  one hour and 45 minutes will, therefore, be allocated for the debate. The  proposer will have 10 minutes to propose the motion and 10 minutes to wind up.  All other Members will have five minutes. Two amendments have been selected and  published on the Marshalled List. The proposer of each amendment will have 10  minutes to propose and five minutes to wind up.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
	    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls on the Minister for Social  Development to bring forward a proposal for legislation on the regulation of  private landlords.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I accept both amendments, because their intent is  in keeping with the spirit of the motion.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">A Cheann Comhairle agus a chaired. I brought a similar  motion on the registration of private landlords to this House more than a year  ago. After that motion won Members&rsquo; support, I firmly believed that the  Minister for Social Development would introduce legislation that would make it  mandatory for landlords in the private-rented sector to register. However, for  reasons that are baffling &mdash; and despite the fact that the previous motion was  given full support in this Chamber, including the support of the Minister and  her party &mdash; that has not been the case.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">What have been the consequences to tenants of the  Minister&rsquo;s failure and her reluctance to legislate for the sentiments of the  motion passed in October 2007? Many tenants in the private-rented sector have  been illegally evicted from their homes or cheated out of their deposits. Other  tenants have been intimidated by landlords who told them that complaining about  deplorable living conditions would lead to their being left on the streets.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in has long recognised that many landlords in the  private-rented sector play a major role in the provision of decent housing for  their tenants. It is accepted that many in the private sector provide excellent  accommodation. However, while many in that sector recognise the existence of bad  landlords, they disagree about how they should be regulated. Nor is it agreed  that there are too many landlords providing poor units of accommodation. The  best way forward that was suggested by the private-rented sector was to allow  the market to regulate it. In light of recent events in relation to the global  credit crisis, surely there are clear indications that the market is not  capable of regulating any sector.</p>
	    <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr McClarty] in the Chair)</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">We have also raised concerns about the role of some estate  agents in the private-rented sector. Some agents have changed their charging  arrangements from monthly to four-weekly payments so that they can extract an  extra four weeks&rsquo; rent over the calendar year. That is gross manipulation of  tenants, many of whom cannot afford to pay the additional money and go into  debt to do so. It amounts to an attack on the neediest people in our society.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The continuous problem of landlords charging rent that is  substantially higher than the housing benefit rate for particular areas forces  many people into debt, and that practice is widespread. There are mechanisms in  place for people to make complaints, but most people will not complain because  of threats of violence or eviction. For many people it is better to suffer than  to sleep on the streets.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">In a question for written answer to the Minister for Social  Development, the Member for North Belfast Fred Cobain asked how many  enforcement orders had been brought against landlords under the Private  Tenancies Order 2006. The reply stated that district councils are proactive in  carrying out their responsibilities, with one enforcement case in Ards, two in  Ballymoney, 13 in Banbridge, 42 in Belfast, 14 in Carrickfergus, five in  Castlereagh, three in Craigavon, one in Down, one in Dungannon and three in  Newtownabbey. There was no mention of the other councils across the North, but  that is the standard under which those councils have operated. Many other  landlords lease houses that are in poor condition but have not been inspected.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in does not distinguish between landlords who  provide accommodation in houses in multiple occupation (HMO) and landlords in  the private-rented sector. Many landlords supply houses to both sectors,  therefore, the whole sector must be regulated by the same legislation.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText"><strong>In a recent  consultation document, the Housing Executive said</strong>:</p>
	    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Out of 134 statutory notices served on HMOs in  Dungannon 49 (36%) were abated by the landlord moving the tenants &hellip; to unknown  destinations.&rdquo;</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The document went on to state that although the  Housing (Management of Houses in Multiple Occupation) Regulations 1993 require  landlords to provide managers of schemes to pass on relevant information, there  is no incentive in the regulations to make them do so.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Some landlords ignore the system; therefore, strong  legislation, such as mandatory registration, is required for the entire  private-rented sector, as it is the only effective way of dealing with those  landlords.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The same document stated that 11% of HMOs in south Belfast were unfit for human habitation, as were 17% in  north Belfast, 2% in Coleraine and 13% in Derry. The document further stated that, given that there  are thousands of unregistered HMOs, those figures are actually far worse. In my  constituency of West Belfast, it is not known  how many of those houses exist. In fact, the private-rented sector has grown in  West Belfast to such an extent that it is  undermining the social fabric of many districts. Many properties are in poor  condition, and we have all heard the horror stories about houses in bad states  of repair. I am sure that many Members have dealt with such issues as  antisocial tenants being forced on local residents, and residents&rsquo; complaints  that have gone unheeded by landlords who do not care because they are getting  the high rents demanded.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I have spoken to many people in the housing sector and in  local government who have said that those problems are but a drop in the ocean.  Without stronger powers and mandatory registration, their ability to deal with  those problems is being seriously undermined. It is difficult to comprehend why  the Minister is reluctant to implement the necessary legislation, as tens of  millions of pounds in housing benefit is paid to landlords every year.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">In the past, it has been intimated that the remit of the  private-rented sector is to be widened to allow more people to move into the  sector, especially given the lack of social housing. For many people, moving to  the private-rented sector is seen as a last resort, and, with no regulation to protect  tenants, they will be condemned to living at the mercy of many unscrupulous  landlords. All available information points to mandatory registration as the  only weapon available to ensure that tenants are protected.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">We ask the Minister to commit to introducing legislation  that will allow some control over the private-rented sector and make it  mandatory that all landlords be registered. Sinn F&eacute;in proposes that, in order  to make mandatory registration effective, the legislation must contain measures  that ensure compliance and impose strong penalties for non-compliance. We ask  the Assembly to support the motion in order that we may send a clear message to  the victims of unscrupulous landlords that we are no longer prepared to accept  this deplorable situation.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Simpson</strong>:  I beg to move amendment No 1: Leave out all after &ldquo;Assembly&rdquo; and insert</p>
	    <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;recognises the intention of the Minister for Social  Development to bring forward legislation to regulate private landlords; and  calls on the Minister to ensure that these regulations will tackle unfitness in  the sector, whilst ensuring that unnecessary bureaucracy is avoided.&rdquo;</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I declare an interest as a very good landlord, in a very  small way.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the amendment that stands in my name and that of  my colleagues. The motion is in need of two things: first, it and its sponsors  must be challenged; and, secondly, the motion needs to be amended.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion was tabled by three Sinn F&eacute;in MLAs. Given the  fact that those three Sinn F&eacute;in MLAs felt so exercised about the issue that  they tabled the motion, I imagine that they want people to believe that the  matter is of pressing importance to them and that it is one of their  priorities. That is interesting, given where we are as an Assembly at present,  and given their party leader&rsquo;s recent foot-stamping as he desperately tries to  appear relevant to a world that has passed him by.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The following question must be asked: if the Minister for  Social Development were to introduce legislation tomorrow, would the three Sinn  F&eacute;in MLAs&rsquo; attachment to the issue be enough for them to urge their colleagues  to attend an Executive meeting to approve its intro&shy;duction? There is  absolutely no point in Members tabling motion after motion, calling for  Minister after Minister to take action after action, only for them to then say  that they will not go along to discuss the possible introduction of legislation  on the subject.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">For a community that is well used to Sinn F&eacute;in hypocrisy  and double standards, to say that this is one of that party&rsquo;s more obvious and  less convincing motions is really saying something. Then again, I may be being  unkind to the three MLAs. Perhaps the new Sinn F&eacute;in policy is government by  urgent procedure. Perhaps that is the brave new world into which Mr Adams is  leading his party &mdash; time will tell. Either way, the real question that hangs  over the motion is not one for the Minister or any other party in the Chamber  to answer but one for the three Members who tabled it and their party to  answer.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">It is clear that the motion should be amended. Our  amendment embraces all the essential ingredients needed for a debate on the  regulation of private landlords. The Minister for Social Development is to  introduce legislation. Draft proposals are to be put out for consultation by  March 2009. We welcome that commitment. Of course, the three Sinn F&eacute;in Members  in whose name the motion stands already know that, or, at least, they should  know it, which again &mdash;</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Simpson</strong>:  No, I will not give way. Serious doubt is cast over the motion&rsquo;s real intent.  Our amendment also highlights two pressing requirements: the legislation must  incorporate a way in which to tackle landlords&rsquo; responsibilities for housing  unfitness; and it must ensure that unnecessary bureaucracy is avoided.</p>
	    <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Some issues of concern are the registration of private  landlords; the general fitness of a premises for human habitation; the  resolution of tenancy disputes; prompt repairs; how, when, and how often rents  can be increased; the length of contract; notice to quit; and the protection of  tenancy deposits. There are also issues to do with training landlords on their  rights and on those of tenants. Those matters are all of huge importance to  anyone who has entered into a private-rented agreement, or who is about to do  so.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">There are also issues regarding landlords&rsquo; rights in  dealing with the small minority of problem tenants; however, time will not  allow for a full discussion of those matters. At the beginning of my  contribution, I declared an interest as a landlord, so I speak from experience.  It is a serious issue for a landlord when a tenant stops paying rent, then  disappears after trashing an apartment; I am sure that I am not alone in  experiencing that. Just as the majority of tenants are ordinary, hard-working,  civic-minded people, so many private landlords do the right thing. Such people  should not be overburdened by bureaucracy.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">This is an important issue, despite the obvious hypocrisy  that lies at the heart of Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s motion and in that Assembly group&rsquo;s  game-playing. Our amendment deals with the entirety of the issue, and I commend  it to the House.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Purvis</strong>: I  beg to move amendment No 2: At end insert</p>
	    <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;to include provision for the mandatory registration of, and  establishment of service standards for, private landlords.&rdquo;</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Although I support Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s motion in principle, it  needs to go further by calling for the mandatory registration of landlords. On  1 October 2007, the House debated and agreed to a motion that Fra McCann moved  that called for the mandatory registration of all private-sector landlords. I  have some sympathy with amendment No 1, but the issues facing those in the  private-rented sector go beyond unfitness. This is a critical issue. More than  a year ago, the House agreed to Fra McCann&rsquo;s motion, which called for  legislation in that area. However, the Minister for Social Develop&shy;ment has not  introduced any legislation on the matter. In the meantime, the shortage of  social housing and still-inflated house prices mean that many more people rely  on the private-rented market for housing. Buy-to-let mortgages have increased  the number of private-rented homes that are available, and renting privately is  increasingly the tenancy agreement of choice for many young people.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Legislation to improve the sector is not about unnecessary  bureaucracy. The mandatory registration of private landlords and the establishment  of service standards should improve the quality of properties, improve  standards for landlords&rsquo; management of properties and tenancies, and improve  the service for tenants. Housing is the number one issue that I deal with in my  constituency office, and I do so regularly. Indeed, I would hazard a guess that  that is the case for the majority of MLAs. In my office, many of the  housing-related issues that we help people with are simply consequences of the  absence of mandatory registration of private landlords.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Some tenants living in private housing that is in a state  of disrepair cannot locate their landlords to request necessary repairs. That  is a common problem that occurs daily. According to the 2006 house conditions  survey, 64% of private-rented dwellings were classed as being in need of  repairs. Some 27% of private-rented dwellings failed to meet the decent homes  standard, the criteria for which state that a home must be in a reasonable  state of repair, have reasonable modern facilities and services, and provide a  reasonable degree of thermal comfort. Most of the tenants in such homes are  elderly and on low incomes.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Neighbours who are affected by antisocial behaviour are  sometimes unable to locate the owners of a dwelling in order to speak to them  about the behaviour of their tenants. That is an issue. Sometimes, in my  constituency, even the police have had difficulty in tracking down landlords to  deal with issues of antisocial behaviour.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The inappropriate and, sometimes, illegal retention of a  tenant&rsquo;s deposit by a landlord is also a problem. Recently, I was visited by a  tenant who paid a &pound;1,200 deposit for his or her flat, and the landlord refused  to repay it when the contract ended, because a door handle had been broken.  Furthermore, landlords are issuing 28-day notices to quit, or eviction notices,  without even talking to the tenants concerned.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Most landlords are good citizens and respectable  businesspeople, who meet their legal obligations, maintain their properties and  look after their tenants. However, that is not always the case, and the  consequences can be significant. Shelter is a basic human requirement;  therefore, it is critical that those who provide that service, in either the  public or private sector, adhere to reasonable standards for conduct and the  quality of service that they provide. When that does not happen &mdash; as we now  debate &mdash; we must legislate to make it happen.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Experience from other systems has shown that efforts to  register landlords are most successful when compliance is mandatory. In Scotland, the  attempted light touch has proved ineffective when trying to enforce standards,  particularly with those landlords who do not register for whatever reason.  Landlords should be required to provide their contact details and details of all  their properties, and that information must be regularly updated. Therefore,  registration must be mandatory, and a failure to register should result in a  prosecution or a fine. There should be a system of sanctions for serious  misconduct. The Department or office that is responsible for registration  should have the authority to deregister landlords who fail to comply with legal  requirements.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Registration can also be used to educate landlords about  their legal obligations. The Housing Rights Service supports mandatory  registration and suggests that registered landlords be provided with a licence  on condition that they follow guidelines set down in an approved code of  practice. Registered landlords would also have access to a dispute-resolution  service. Tenants should have access to the register and should be able to  retrieve, without charge, their landlord&rsquo;s current contact information.  Moreover, there should be provision for a custodial-deposit scheme to ensure  that deposits are managed safely and are not withheld by landlords,  unreasonably or illegally. If there is a dispute over a deposit, tenants have  access only to small claims courts, which are prohibitively expensive and  time-consuming for most. Instead, landlords should be required to pay those deposits  into a custodial system so that, if there is a disagreement over a deposit at  the end of a tenancy, landlords and tenants will have access to the same  dispute-resolution service, and a third party will oversee the process.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Although I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to bring  forward proposals for legislation at the end of this session, it is not soon  enough. I hear daily about the problem from constituents who come into my  office. Proposals must be brought forward sooner and must include mandatory registration  and the establishment of service standards for all private landlords. I am  pleased to move the amendment.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cobain</strong>: I  welcome the motion and support amendment No 1. Although I recognise the work  that the Minister has undertaken, we still do not have sufficient social  housing in Northern Ireland  to meet the need. Therefore, the private-rented sector is crucial in housing  some of the most vulnerable people in our society. Eleven per cent of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  housing stock is privately rented, and 44% of households in the private-rented  sector live in fuel poverty.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">In 2006, 27% of dwellings in the private-rented sector  failed to meet the decent homes standards, and, over the past five years, there  has been a 50% increase in the number of households presenting as homeless to  the Northern Ireland Housing Executive, due to a loss of rented accommodation.  It is crucial that people who rent in both multiple-occupancy homes and alone  are protected by legislation from the minority of rogue and complacent landlords.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcomed the introduction of the Private Tenancies (Northern Ireland) Order 2006, which provides a  new structure for the private-rented sector in Northern Ireland. Although the  Order covers other tenancy issues, it does not go far enough on unfitness and  disrepair, rent controls and certificates of fitness.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">It does not require landlords to register but relies on  their co-operation, and that is the Order&rsquo;s weakness. I recognise that during  the last debate on the issue, the Minister stated her desire to examine the  success of the Order, looking at what has gone well, where the problems lie,  and what more needs to be done.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that the Minister will inform the Assembly what  difference the Order has made. However, I consider it a matter of practical  necessity that the private-rented sector should be open and transparent, and in  order for that to be guaranteed, the registration of private landlords and  regulations that tackle unfitness in the sector are a must. If such measures  are introduced, the room for complacency, bending the system and blatantly  breaking the law would be removed. That would also benefit landlords as it  would create a level playing field for business.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">This is not an anti-private-rented sector motion in any  way. The sector provides an excellent service for the majority of the time, and  the DUP amendment recognises some of the fears that may exist in the sector  with regard to increased bureaucracy.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">It is crucial that the sector is given the freedom to  maintain healthy competition and business practices while protecting the basic  needs of its customers. The motion is not about excessive regulation but about  creating good regulation that will benefit tenants and landlords. In the  current global conditions, we are all beginning to recognise the benefits of  good regulation. I, therefore, urge the Minister to look at practices in Scotland and decipher what has worked and on  what we in Northern Ireland  can improve.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The credit crunch has crippled the first-time-buyers&rsquo;  market, and that will mean that in coming years, the private-rented sector will  become even more important as people cannot afford to buy their own homes.  Although I welcome the recent investment in the co-ownership scheme, the  housing sector will face severe difficulties for the short term at least. It  is, therefore, crucial that the correct regulation is in place in order to  ensure that people can live in accommodation that is of an acceptable standard.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">It has been almost six months since Sir John Semple  referred to the matter in his review of affordable housing when he called for  the registration of all landlords. However, despite unanimous support from all  parties in the Assembly, the Minister has still not made a categorical move in  that direction.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise the pro-active work so far undertaken by the  Minister. I urge her to introduce legislation that will adequately regulate  private landlords, including registration, and tackle unfitness in the sector.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion as amended by amendment No 1.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I advise any prospective football manager not to recruit Mr McCann to his team.  Mr McCann is the master of own goals, and today he shows his mastery with  regard to own goals. He moves a motion that has been exposed, including through  remarks made by the Chairperson of the Committee for Social Development, Mr  Simpson, as bogus. The motion has also been exposed as opening up a very simple  line of attack on Sinn F&eacute;in, which is this: if the Minister were to produce  legislation today on the regulation of private landlords, she could do nothing  about it because the Executive are not meeting, and the reason for that is  because Sinn F&eacute;in is boycotting Executive meetings.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, when Mr McCann hypocritically comes to this  Chamber and cries about there having been a delay in legislation, he refuses to  answer the fundamental question, namely, why is Sinn F&eacute;in blocking vital social  policy legislation?</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  On a point of order. Mr Maginness is misleading the Assembly, because I have  been consistent on the issue of mandatory registration.</p>
	    <p class="TimePeriod">12.45 pm</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. The term &ldquo;misleading&rdquo; is not parliamentary language, Mr  McCann. That was not a point of order. Your remark was unparliamentary;  therefore, I ask you to withdraw it.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  I withdraw the remark. However, I must say that when Mr Maginness and Members  from other parties are particularly vocal against Members of the House &mdash;</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. That is not a point of order.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I am happy to take an intervention from Mr McCann so that he can explain why,  on the one hand, he supports Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s boycott of the Executive, yet, on the  other hand, he insists that legislation on that particular area of social  policy be brought before the House immediately. If he wants to take the  opportunity to explain that contradiction to the House, I am prepared to give  way.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  On 1 October 2007, I brought a motion on the mandatory regulation of landlords  before the House. The new Chairperson of the Committee for Social Development  will not be aware that I have also raised the matter on several occasions in  Committee. Sinn F&eacute;in has taken a principled stand against the DUP&rsquo;s refusal to  accept the fundamentals of the Good Friday Agreement and the St Andrews  Agreement, which take in equality and the very foundations on which the  Assembly currently sits.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I understand Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s principled approach. However, the fact is that that  principled approach is blocking vital legislation from coming before the House,  not only on the mandatory registration of landlords but on a whole range of  other issues. Fuel poverty, for example, is a pressing concern.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The country is in economic meltdown. Finances are in chaos,  yet Sinn F&eacute;in insists on boycotting the Executive.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  No, I will not give way, because I do not have much time left.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP accepts the motion&rsquo;s substance. It also accepts  the proposed amendments. There is certainly a necessity for legislation to  regulate private landlords. The Minister has committed to that as an objective  of her term of office. As soon as she can, she will introduce legislation to  deal with the issue. She cannot, however, simply introduce legislation without  working out carefully its shape and form.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">In Northern    Ireland, 66% of the public money that is  distributed through housing benefit is paid to private landlords. The  private-rented sector accounts for around 12% of all housing stock. The SDLP  fully supports good regulation, but any measures that are introduced must be  carefully thought through. I am certain that the Minister will expedite the  legislation that she sees fit to introduce.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, I support the motion&rsquo;s substance. However, I  must highlight its motivation. It appears that it has been designed to be a  political attack on the Minister, not on the social problems that arise from  the private-rented sector.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  thank Mr McCann for proposing the motion. I support it and the two proposed  amendments. All add to the call for the regulation of private landlords.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Undoubtedly, the private-rented sector will expand in the  coming months and years owing to current economic trends and the pattern of  inward migration. All Members have heard of good and bad landlords.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">In a recent case in South Belfast,  the agency found three houses occupied by some 80 Roma &mdash; one house was found to  have 30 people crammed into it. That is sheer exploitation of people by  landlords.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">With respect to public housing, the Housing Executive is  responsible for the provision of decent homes and their maintenance in  accordance with rules and regulations. The private-rented sector receives &pound;1&middot;4  million each year in housing benefit. Why should it not be held accountable for  good management practice and standards of repair? The Housing Rights Service&rsquo;s  briefing paper on the Bill makes good sense on that issue. We need a holistic  approach to address a range of issues to make the sector fit for purpose. On  the one hand, we must ask landlords to improve their practices; on the other,  it is good to offer incentives for them to do so. On that, the briefing paper makes  some useful suggestions.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly last debated mandatory registration of  landlords in October 2007, and all Members agreed on the need for the  registration of landlords. A register of landlords would make it much easier  for councils and tenants to contact landlords when problems arise. In South Belfast, a tenant has been trying to contact his  landlord for years so that repairs can be made. The building is now in a  shocking state: a disused bath has been lying in the front garden for 10 years.  Neighbours have written to my party asking for help in tracking down the  landlord. They are understandably worried. Not only is the house an eyesore  but, more importantly, the structural problems of that house may spread to  adjoining properties.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Once registered, a landlord should be required to comply  with an approved code of practice recognised by the courts. Failure to abide by  that code should bring penalties &mdash; fines, or even deregistration.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I also support the suggestion of a deposit-protection  scheme, whereby the landlords have to pay deposits that they receive from  tenants into a custodial fund. We have seen examples whereby tenants &mdash;  particularly students &mdash; pay a deposit to a letting agent, but cannot retrieve  it from the landlord some years later. Landlords put up all sorts of excuses  for refusing to return deposits. So often, people are reluctant to seek redress  from the small claims court. Students who are preparing to move on to other  parts of the Province or to other parts of the UK or who are leaving Northern  Ireland to take up jobs cannot wait for court procedure to take its course.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">We need a comprehensive approach to rein in the  private-rented sector through legislation that sets acceptable standards and  provision of information and advice to landlords and tenants. I am sure that  that will be welcomed, not only by tenants, but by the majority of landlords.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: I  support amendment No 1.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">One Member has commented that housing is the number one  issue in her constituency. However, lack of housing is the number one priority  in my constituency &mdash; and that applies to both public and private sectors. As  has been said, examples of good and bad landlords exist in both private and  public sectors.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Like other Members, I have received complaints from tenants  about rented housing. Some of the worst examples of unfit housing that I have  seen have been in the public sector, not in the private sector.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">There are examples of good private landlords who take the  issues seriously, but there are also examples of the worst kind. I presume that  a lot of these landlords have come into the market because of the property boom  that we have witnessed over the past couple of years. There are major issues  surrounding private individuals who are renting out properties &mdash; they do not understand  their obligations as landlords. They do not understand the issues. If landlords  find themselves with tenants who are not behaving properly, or have to deal  with evictions, they do not understand the laws, or how to get rid of those  tenants and deal with the issues.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I support registration. I also support the Minister&rsquo;s  moving forward with this legislation in March 2009. I look forward to seeing  what is proposed in the Bill. We need to raise the standards of those who have  moved into private landlordism and how they deal with their tenants.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">We have all seen examples of tenants who are outrageous in  their behaviour for whatever reason. We have all witnessed those who are either  dealing in drugs or playing music until all hours of the night. Getting those  people out of the property is a very complex issue. It is extremely complicated  &mdash; even the Housing Executive has issues with moving out tenants like that.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">An awareness scheme must be built into any proposed  legislation. There are examples where legislation has been tried. If we look at  the legislation that was introduced in Scotland in 2006, we can see the  basis on which we could move this situation forward.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I commend the Minister for working on the issue. It is only  right that she take her time to get the issue right, because the rights of  landlords and tenants are a legally complex issue. There is always a war going  on between the two. The Minister must look long and hard at the serious issues,  and get it right. I commend the Minister for continuing to work on the issues,  and look forward to seeing the tentative legislation. As some of my party  members have said, there is more chance of the legislation being introduced to  the Social Development Committee than there is of seeing a meeting of the  Executive.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. It is disappointing that Mr Simpson  did not spend more time dealing with his amendment than he did attacking Sinn  F&eacute;in. He initially spoke about being a good landlord in a small way. I am not  sure if that means that he is good in a small way or that he is a landlord in a  small way. That was not satisfactorily explained to me. I am sure that he will  explain at some point.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Alban Maginness spoke about own goals, a subject in which  he is well versed. If he is speaking about impending legislation from the  Minister, he is getting into the realms of fantasy football. Maybe he should  keep that in mind.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I will now try do deal with the motion &mdash;</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I hope that you are not going to attack anybody?</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>:  Hopefully not, but if I do, it is an education being here anyway.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Refer all your remarks through the Chair, and do not  bat-and-ball them across the Chamber.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: If  the remarks from across the way were, with respect &mdash;</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order, order. All remarks must be made from a standing position  and not from a seated position.</p>
	    <p class="TimePeriod">1.00 pm</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. For many people, the private-rented  sector is their only avenue for accommodation, and any new strategy should  promote the sector as a suitable option. As the sector is playing an  increasingly important role, a strategic framework is needed to ensure  responsible letting. New legislation should ensure that management standards  and physical conditions are improved. The registration of landlords will mean  that there is a more consistent and stronger approach to addressing the issues  of bad management practices and poor fitness standards. A register will better  enable local councils to progress enforcement action more effectively. When  landlords are registered, they can be issued with a licence enabling them to  follow guidelines laid down by an approved code of practice. Landlords will  have to abide by the legal obligations laid down in the relevant legislation;  to ensure effectiveness, any registration scheme must be mandatory.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">After the imposition of a register, a number of issues will  have to be addressed. Relevant information on rights and responsibilities  should be made available to landlords and tenants. The legislation must include  powers to modify the inclusion and exclusion of those who must register. The  enforcement body will have the power to deregister landlords who fail to comply  with legal requirements. A tenant/landlord dispute-resolution service should  also be included. As the registration scheme is being developed, interested  stakeholders must be widely consulted.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">A major source of dispute in the private-rented sector is  the retention of tenancy deposits by landlords. In the legislation, a tenancy  deposit protection scheme must be included so that deposits are safely managed  and not, as happens in many cases, unreasonably withheld. Landlords appear to  have a distinct lack of knowledge on the key issues affecting tenants, so it is  essential that any new legislation gives landlords maximum access to  information pertaining to them and their responsibilities.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">In my constituency, there are private estates, 90% of which  are owned by private landlords. That has led to considerable problems in the  state of the houses and how tenants are treated, which contributes to a lack of  community in those estates. I support the motion, and I wish to make a point  concerning students, which has already been raised with the Minister for  Employment and Learning. I have raised a certain case on several occasions, in  which a student died and the money owed is still being pursued by the landlord,  causing trauma and stress for that student&rsquo;s parents and family. Go raibh maith  agat.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  I declare an interest, not as a good landlord but as an excellent landlord; I  support amendment No 1.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The debate is perhaps asking more questions of Sinn F&eacute;in  than of the Minister for Social Development. We are used to d&eacute;j&agrave; vu in the  Chamber, so I will restate some of the comments that have been made. Along with  other Members, I am struck by the irony &mdash; or, more accurately, the hypocrisy &mdash;  of Sinn F&eacute;in Members calling on the Minister for Social Development to act but  not calling on its own Ministers, who are still refusing to fulfill their  ministerial duties.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">When the issue of private landlords was last debated, there  was consensus that a registration scheme was, in principle, a good idea. My  views have not changed; although I support the principle, I reserve final  judgement until I see those firm proposals. No firm proposals have yet been  produced; however, I believe that we only have to wait for them until March  2009. At least we have a date for those proposals, unlike the next Executive  meeting. Nevertheless, by that time, we will have a further year&rsquo;s experience  of the Private Tenancies (Northern    Ireland) Order 2006.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Although that Order has been effective in some areas, it  was criticised for not going far enough when it first came into force. The  Housing Rights Service, in its recent briefing to the Committee for Social  Develop&shy;ment, alleged that many local councils&rsquo; enforcement of the Order has  been almost non-existent. The evidence for that is contained, purportedly, in a  response to a question for written answer from the Member for North Belfast Mr  Cobain. The response suggested that mandatory registration may assist  enforcement, because local councils may not know the landlords&rsquo; identity.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Without further investigation of the figures, it is a bit  of a leap to level criticism at councils or to suggest that mandatory  registration would have any impact. In its briefing to the Committee, the  Housing Rights Service provided no evidence of further questions to the  councils asking them to account for the ostensibly low figures.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The Housing Rights Service made several suggestions: the  inclusion of a landlord licence in the mandatory registration scheme of private  landlords; access to a dispute-resolution service for the landlord and the  tenant; an assessment by councils of the fitness of properties built before 6  November 1956; the provision of information on rights and responsibilities to  landlords and tenants; prosecution for failure to register; and deregistration  for those who fail to comply with their responsibilities. Finally, it suggested  that the scheme be phased in.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">In general, there is not much to disagree with in those  proposals, other than whether the power to deregister a landlord would assist a  tenant residing in one of his or her houses. However, the details of such a  proposal would, no doubt, be ironed out during consultation with stakeholders.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister previously stated that she was investigating  various registration schemes. Given that she responded to Mr McCann and Mr  O&rsquo;Dowd to that effect in May 2008, and advised the former that any legislation  would be introduced in the final session of this Assembly&rsquo;s mandate, it is  wholly premature to debate the matter yet again.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">However, the amendment that my colleagues tabled provides a  welcome addition to the debate. For the sake of completeness, I will again set  out, as I did in October 2007, my thoughts on the overall issue. I agree with  the concept of mandatory registration to provide a level of security to tenants  that the rented property is of an appropriate standard and that the landlord is  reputable. Any proposed register must allow for access to required information  only and should not be a means to facilitate prying into the affairs of  individuals.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Members should be concerned by the cost of administering  and enforcing the scheme. We must ensure that bureaucracy be kept to a minimum  to facilitate the smooth running of an effective system that safeguards tenants  but does not become so onerous for landlords that it becomes unworkable. I  support amendment No 1.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>:  I welcome the motion, and I support the DUP amendment. It is crucial to protect  vulnerable people from bad landlords. It should be recognised that the  private-rented sector is essential to the housing stock and that the vast  majority of landlords follows best practice. However, those landlords who do  not respect their tenants have a damaging effect on their quality of life, be  that through demands for excessive rent, disputes about deposits or the  provision of accommodation that does not meet the required standard. Many  people who have limited housing options are at the mercy of unprincipled  landlords. Therefore, it is crucial that the Assembly introduce legislation to  ensure that landlords meet required standards.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP&rsquo;s amendment, as my colleague noted, recognises  landlords&rsquo; potential concerns about the increasing bureaucracy that will affect  the sector. New legislation should be regarded as a way in which to ensure a  level playing field for landlords, in order that some do not gain an unfair  advantage over others or at the expense of their tenants. It is important not  to damage the supply of private-rented accommodation.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I draw Members&rsquo; attention to regulations that were  introduced in Scotland  in 2006. They include several rational exemptions from registration and ensure  that judgments are based on adopting a sensible and practical approach before  deciding that sanctions are necessary. Landlords have a duty of care to the  buildings that they own and to the people who live in them. In the coming  months, Sinn F&eacute;in has a duty of care to this Building and to the people whom it  was elected to represent.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">In the coming months, the private-rented sector will become  increasingly important because the first-time-buyers&rsquo; market is stagnant and  people will, potentially, fail to renew their mortgages. Therefore, it is vital  that legislation is in place to regulate the system properly. People should  feel safe and secure in rented accommodation and in their homes, and the  Assembly must ensure that the important amendment is noted.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  I appreciate that the majority of private landlords are responsible and can  manage their tenants without difficulty. It is essential that all responsible  landlords understand that message. The motion targets landlords who do not  fulfil their responsibilities. Not all tenants are saints, and we must be  mindful of the vital role that private-sector lettings play in accommodating  our population. Therefore, there must be a balance in any registration  programme that is produced. We cannot allow a black market in substandard  accommodation to develop &mdash; that may be a consequence of ill-judged or rushed  regulation.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I represent a constituency that &mdash; because of the University of Ulster at Coleraine and high tourist  levels &mdash; has a large number of private-sector landlords. I have heard nightmare  stories from constituents who have &mdash; and I use the word advisedly &mdash; suffered at  the hands of some private landlords, who refuse to fix broken locks and attempt  to intimidate tenants from properties. Such disgusting behaviour is often  inflicted on those who are least able to fight back or seek help.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">A compulsory registration scheme for landlords would give  tenants greater security, and ensure good living conditions and a fair rent.  The private-rented sector is becoming an increasing part of the housing stock,  and, therefore, it is essential that the Assembly ensures the protection of the  large number of people who seek accommodation in that sector. The private  sector cuts across all economic barriers. Furthermore, private rentals are  likely to increase, because an increasing number of young people and couples  are experiencing difficulty gaining public-sector housing or affording a  mortgage.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The compulsory regulation of landlords would not be a  punishment, rather a means of ensuring that all accommodation is of good  quality. Good or bad housing does not affect only the well-being of those who  live in it. Bad housing may lead to health problems, which can impact on a  child&rsquo;s education or an individual&rsquo;s ability to get a job.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I know that the Minister takes the issue seriously, and I  acknowledge that the problem is being investigated in order to find a way to  deal with it. However, given the current economic downturn, the urgency with  which the issue is addressed must be stepped up a gear. I support the  amendment.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development (Ms Ritchie)</strong>: The motion and amendments provide a  welcome and timely opportunity to highlight the considerable work that is  already under way to deliver improvements in the private-rented sector, which  is now almost as large as the public-rented sector in Northern Ireland.  In recent years, the private-rented sector has undergone much innovation. The  introduction of the Private Tenancies (Northern Ireland) Order 2006, which  came into effect in April 2007, came on foot of earlier private-rented  strategy. Those initiatives delivered improvements and established a new system  of regulation, which gave tenants and landlords much-needed rights, protections  and responsibilities.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">At that time, the objectives of those initiatives were  far-reaching. However, the housing situation has subsequently developed and now  faces new challenges. Some aspects tackled by the previous strategy and  legislation have become much more acute.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The private-rented sector is now home to many more  vulnerable people, so we must be confident that arrangements in the sector are  robust and professional, and ensure that the right level of protection is  afforded to the tenants and to the landlords who provide services.</p>
	    <p class="TimePeriod">1.15 pm</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Over the past couple of years, the fast-moving developments  in the housing market &mdash; together with their associated impact on the  private-rented sector&rsquo;s contribution and potential to meet housing need &mdash;  prompted me to commission a further review of my policy relating to the  private-rented sector earlier this year. I am surprised that some Members were  not aware of that. Many of the points that Members made today support that  approach.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">There should be a new focus on core issues, such as more  effective tenancy management; robust arrange&shy;ments for the resolution of  disputes between landlords and tenants; effective tenancy deposit arrangements;  better security of tenure for people moving into private-rented accommodation;  and other matters. That work is already in progress and I will have the  results, together with draft proposals for a new private-rented strategy, by  March or April next year. At that stage, I intend to consult widely on those  proposals.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I will use that review to consider the initial impact of  The Private Tenancies (Northern    Ireland) Order 2006. Although that  legislation is still in the early stages of implementation, I will measure its  immediate impact against its key objectives. I will study its effect of  improving awareness and understanding of the new obligations and rights of  landlords and tenants. Early evidence suggests that there is a continued lack of  knowledge at all levels. The experiences and views of Members that were  expressed today support some of that analysis. I will work with stakeholders to  find the most effective ways to improve that position as quickly as possible.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The evaluation also considers how the district councils  have used their new enforcement powers, which were provided in the legislation,  to target unfitness and disrepair. That was a primary objective of The Private  Tenancies (Northern Ireland)  Order 2006. Careful analysis is needed to determine the need for new or  enhanced policy initiatives and, therefore, the need for any subsequent  supporting legislation. The motion calls on me to introduce a proposal for  legislation on the regulation of private landlords. When I announced the new  housing agenda earlier this year, I made it clear that I wanted to support  people to move into the home of their choice.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Increasingly, the private-rented sector is playing a bigger  part in meeting housing need, in some cases through choice. However, for more  vulnerable people on lower incomes, that is solely because they have no  realistic alternative. To respond effectively to that need, the sector needs to  be fit for purpose and provide good physical standards of well-managed  accommodation. In the private-rented sector, 66% of tenants receive housing  benefit. I will explore how that considerable investment could be used to  positively influence future landlord behaviour.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The facts in the private-rented sector speak for  themselves. The poor perception of life in some parts of that sector appears to  be borne out by the level of problems that private-renting tenants experience.  Despite the introduction of new laws, evidence from advice services shows that  levels of enquiries have remained constant. That clearly points to the need for  action to improve the core problems of tenant management, which include rent  books and deposits. Furthermore, tenancy agreements are needed to provide  confidence against fears of intimidation and unlawful conviction, as well as for  repairs and improvement arrangements.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Despite considerable progress in recent years, real  problems with unfitness levels remain. The private-rented sector has an older  stock profile and, therefore, has greater unfitness and disrepair problems. The  &lsquo;House Condition Survey 2006&rsquo; showed that the private-rented sector accounted  for a high proportion of Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s unfit housing. Security of tenure  for tenants in the private-rented sector also remains a fundamental issue,  thereby contributing to a lack of confidence.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, the tenancy-deposit schemes and  dispute-resolution mechanisms are essential, and they will be considered as  part of the development of the new strategy for the private-rented sector.  Evidence from the South of Ireland&rsquo;s dispute-resolution system suggests that  the majority of disputes there concern deposits.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Compared to home ownership, in Northern Ireland, renting is often  considered to be, and experienced as, second best. In other countries, that  negative opinion of renting does not exist, and, in order to address that, I am  determined that unscrupulous actions, wherever they occur, will not be  tolerated. Good practice will be promoted throughout the sector, with  appropriate support and guidance made available for landlords and tenants.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Previous legislation has gone some way towards challenging  some of the difficulties with, and in delivering tangible improvements to, the  quality of private-rented properties. That legislation established better  rights for &mdash; and has clarified the responsibilities of &mdash; people involved in  that sector.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The Private Tenancies (Northern Ireland) Order 2006  strengthened harassment and eviction law in order to prevent unscrupulous  landlords from harassing tenants. In addition, it established protections for  tenants concerning notice periods, and it places obligations on landlords to  provide rent books and written tenancy terms. Furthermore, specific regulations  continue to apply to particular tenancies, such as unfit private tenancies,  protected and statutory tenancies and houses in multiple occupation.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The regulation of private tenancies on the basis of  unfitness addresses a major housing problem that has proven intractable for  many years. District councils have been provided with significant additional  powers to compel landlords to make properties fit, to carry out necessary  repairs, and to ensure that rental income is dramatically reduced while a  property remains unfit.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr W McCrea</strong>:  Will the Minster assure the House that having considering this matter, the forthcoming  legislation will deal with the problem of unfitness, without extending the  existing massive amount of bureaucracy, which is the fear of some Members?</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his intervention, and I can  assure the House that every angle will be explored.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Protected-tenancy regulations ensure that the important  security of tenure that that limited group of tenants enjoys can be  safeguarded, while ensuing that rent levels, although higher than equivalent  Housing Executive rents, will continue to be subject to statutory limits.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Given the existence of the Landlords Association of  Northern Ireland (LANI), it would be wrong to think that all is bad in the  private-rented sector, which, as it has grown, has delivered much high-quality  accommodation. Not all landlords are the same, and I welcome that fact that  many private-sector landlords have formed their own association &mdash; LANI &mdash; whose  aim is to professionalise and drive up standards in the industry. I met that  group, and I have instructed officials to engage with it concerning regulatory  matters. I believe that that is the first ever structured engagement between  Government and the private-rented sector.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">A statutory registration scheme operates for houses in  multiple occupation, which are of particular concern due to the high levels of  health and safety risks that they pose. Arguably, they give rise to a  disproportionate amount of antisocial behaviour in local communities. The  Housing Executive&rsquo;s registration scheme aims to address those matters and to  ensure that non-compliance is tackled effectively.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">In the course of the next few months, my officials will  meet stakeholders to develop ideas and proposals for an overall strategic  framework for the private-rented sector. Increased regulation of private  landlords will, of course, be one of the many matters to be addressed, and the  outcome of that policy-development exercise will enable me to find strategic  solutions that are capable of delivering sustainable improvements in order to  effectively, and in a timely manner, tackle those agreed matters in the  private-rented sector.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I have heard calls for a mandatory registration scheme for  private landlords. However, I remain concerned that that has been proposed as  the panacea for the problems in the private-rented sector. My examination of  the effectiveness of such schemes in the South of Ireland and in Scotland has  not produced a cut-and-dried result. Although there is agreement that such  schemes have delivered several benefits &mdash; for example, increased knowledge of  the scale and spread of the private-rented sector &mdash; that has been at a  considerable cost and, some three years on, with some debate about the  measurable outcomes.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Competing arguments point to alternative and effective approaches  that deal with the core problems, such as tenancy deposit schemes, dispute  arrangements, better security of tenure and more effective use of housing  benefit to drive good practice. I will continue to monitor the impact of those  schemes and keep in touch with developments, particularly in Scotland, where  a voluntary landlord accreditation scheme is under consideration. Similarly, an  evaluation of the scheme in the South of Ireland is ongoing.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">As part of the new housing agenda, I am committed to ensuring  that everyone in Northern    Ireland has access to a decent, affordable  home &mdash; I believe that all Members want to see that. The private-rented sector  has an increasingly important role to play in achieving that, particularly as  it provides a home for a diverse range of households. My work to develop a new  strategy for the private-rented sector will ensure that priority issues in the  sector are dealt with effectively. Subject to the outcome of that work, I am  sure that new legislation will be required to give life to the new strategy for  the sector. I aim to introduce that in the latter part of 2009-10.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">As Members know, a draft housing Bill from my Department is  caught in the current logjam at the Executive. I emphasise that the lack of  Executive meetings will undoubtedly have a damaging impact on the legislative  timetable, and I hope that that does not carry through to my forthcoming second  housing Bill, which will regulate &mdash;</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Apologies; I will not give way because I have only a  few minutes left.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">That Bill will regulate the private-rented sector. I ask  the Members who proposed the motion &mdash; who belong to the party that is refusing  to allow the Executive to meet &mdash; to do all in their power to ensure that that  legislation does not slip. If those Members genuinely care about, and feel compassion  for, people living in the private-rented sector, surely they will not allow  this legislation &mdash; or any form of legislation that impacts on the social and  economic conditions of the people of Northern Ireland &mdash; to slip.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome a strong vote of support for the work that I have  put in place to improve conditions in the private-rented sector through the  development of a strategic framework to ensure that everyone in our society has  access to a decent, secure and affordable home. I believe that all Members want  to see that happen. I will write to Members individually if I have not answered  any issues that were raised.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Purvis</strong>:  It is unfortunate that some Members choose to expend a lot of energy in scoring  points; I urge those Members to use a similar amount of energy in trying to  resolve the issues that are preventing the Executive from meeting.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I return to the debate, and I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s  commitment to dealing with the issue. I acknowledge the hard work that she and  her Department have done, and I look forward to seeing, and commenting on, the  proposals when they are published.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The debate was wide-ranging and represented the views of  landlords and tenants in the private-rented sector. For many of the reasons  that were outlined, there is much interest in the issue. We must improve the  management of properties and tenancies by landlords, so legislation is  important, and the mandatory registration of landlords is crucial. Many of the  core issues were discussed: the fitness of properties; the rights of tenants,  which include access to deposits and security of tenure; and safeguards for  landlords in relation to absconders and evictions.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">However, the primary reason that the legislation is needed  is to promote good practice in the private-rented sector. That sector is  growing rapidly in Northern    Ireland, and we must ensure that it is  regulated, for the benefit of tenants and landlords.</p>
	    <p class="TimePeriod">1.30 pm</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  Everything that I want to say has been said already, and I agree with what the  Minister has said. However, quite frankly, this motion should not have been  before the House today. I say that, not because there is not a housing need or  a housing crisis &mdash; there certainly is. I say it because it seems that the  crisis is not yet big enough for Sinn F&eacute;in to do what any normal party would  do, which is to allow things to move on.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Alban Maginness was correct when he said that tabling the  motion was a classic own goal. Sinn F&eacute;in is like a rabbit caught in the  headlights. In tabling the motion, that party is either not conscious of the  fact that everyone sees its members as the fools that they are or it wants to  ensure that its members are viewed as such. This issue could be dealt with if  Sinn F&eacute;in were to allow progress to occur in Northern Ireland.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">It is hypocritical &mdash; in fact it is a lot of nonsense &mdash; for  Sinn F&eacute;in to ask the House to instruct the Minister to get on with things when  it is that party alone that is responsible for telling her that she cannot help  because it will not let her do so. Sinn F&eacute;in seems to be totally confused  today. Its Members must stand up and say what they believe and believe in what  they say.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Dawn Purvis has said that this is not the time for  point-scoring, and she is absolutely correct. This is not the time for  point-scoring: this is the time for getting things done. The blame has got to  lie fairly and squarely where it belongs. Sinn F&eacute;in is holding up progress and  it does not want social-sector housing to be progressed. It feels that it can  play politics with people&rsquo;s lives and futures. It is absolutely ridiculous and  disgraceful that the Executive cannot meet because Sinn F&eacute;in will not allow  them to meet.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in is not playing ball because things are not going  its way. Its view is that if things are not done its way, it will not allow the  Executive to meet. What sort of an agreement did Sinn F&eacute;in think that it had  signed up to &mdash; an agreement based on a Sinn F&eacute;in agenda? Of course, that was  not the case.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a housing crisis in Northern Ireland, and thousands of  people are in need of housing urgently. Landlords must be regulated, because  not all of them are good landlords. The Assembly has heard today from several  Members who are also landlords, and they have protested that they are good  landlords, and I accept that. However, not all landlords are good landlords.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, there is the problem of serious overcrowding  in the private sector. The Minister told us something quite startling today &mdash;  that private-sector letting is now as large as social-sector letting. The House  and the Assembly are charged with a responsibility for addressing those issues.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">For how much longer can Sinn F&eacute;in sit on its hands? How  many more people are going to be in a housing crisis before that party takes  action? Its stance is hurting its constituents as much as those represented by  other parties. Some of the Members who proposed the motion today represent West Belfast, where, I suspect, there is housing need.  There is also housing need in my own town, Dungannon, where literally hundreds  of people are waiting to be housed. Those people cannot be helped unless and  until the Minister is given the authority and the opportunity to help. The  Minister has been sincere today when she says that she wants to tackle this  social issue.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I have been involved in social housing and private-sector  housing for the past 30 years. It is appalling that the Assembly is debating a  motion that does not need to be debated. This motion is a vain repetition of  what happened in the House 12 months ago. Since then, we have not moved forward  one inch &mdash; all because Sinn F&eacute;in wants to play politics with people&rsquo;s futures &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">If you want to say something get to your feet. If Sinn F&eacute;in  were sincere, it would not be tabling motions such as this; it would be going  to the Executive table.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Councillor, and MLA, Fra McCann was &mdash;  rightly &mdash; admonished for speaking across the Chamber. The Member opposite is  doing likewise, but you have not addressed that.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: It is strange that Members can see faults in others but fail to  see faults in themselves. I was sitting in the Chair, and I saw that remarks  were being made to and fro across the Chamber. It was coming close to the end  of the Member&rsquo;s allocated five minutes, so I allowed him to continue.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Will you provide clarity to the  House on a technicality? I thought that if both amendments were accepted, both  would be carried. I know that you explained it to my colleague earlier, but  will you clarify whether the second amendment will fall if the first amendment  is successful.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: That is correct, and I will remind Members of that before the  Question on the amendment is put. Amendment No 2 will fall if amendment No 1 is  made.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Thank you for that clarification. Sinn F&eacute;in regrets that it cannot accept both  amendments, and we extend our apologies to Dawn Purvis and the PUP. We accept  the sentiments of both amendments, but, judging by the way in which the debate  has developed, the DUP amendment will be accepted.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Fra McCann and my colleagues had every right to move the  motion, and we will not be chastised by any Member for doing so. There are  stark difficulties out there, and, as the Minister said, the private sector is  growing to almost the same size as the social sector &mdash; if not bigger. With that  expansion, the need for mandatory regulation of the sector also increases.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Every Member who has spoken has said that there are good  landlords, and that must be recognised. Constituencies such as North Belfast have many private landlords. I know that  there are many good landlords, because I work closely with them. Equally, and  unfortunately, there are more landlords who are not so good. In fact, there are  a few whom I have never seen in the many years that I have represented my  constituency. I welcome the enforcement powers that are emerging from councils,  and I will vigorously pursue some of the landlords who, for many intents and purposes,  have homes on interfaces. Some landlords have allowed their houses to lie  vacant; some have let their houses to families who have extreme social  problems, and they are causing all sorts of difficulties. The main thrust of  the situation is that mandatory regulation is required.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to Fred Cobain&rsquo;s question about HMOs and  private landlords, Fra McCann provided some figures from different councils.  However, the statistics and figures relating to many stories have yet to  unfold. Registration is voluntary, and it defies logic to expect any unscrupulous  landlord to register themselves voluntarily.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not agree with the way in which David Simpson moved  the DUP amendment. Fra McCann has already said that he accepts the sentiments  of the amendment, because he accepts the need to introduce regulation of the  sector, and all Members who spoke in the debate agreed. Dawn Purvis&rsquo;s amendment  goes further and calls for mandatory registration.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  In the Minister for Social Development&rsquo;s response to the debate, she referred  to HMOs and the need for registration, and so forth, of other properties. Furthermore,  she acknowledged that it might be 2013 before all HMOs are registered, and that  further underlines the need for the mandatory regulation and registration of  landlords. Such measures will ensure the proper regulation of the sector, as  all Members have said is required.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  I accept Alex Maskey&rsquo;s comments. Although other Members touched on the issue, I  did not realise that the registration of all HMOs will take until 2013; that is  worrying.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Dawn Purvis &mdash; as well as other Members such as Fra McCann  and Mickey Brady &mdash; talked about the impact that is left by an unscrupulous  landlord. They also mentioned the impact that the allocation of a house to an  antisocial family will have on tenants, families and the community in which the  house is located. The effects of an absentee landlord were also mentioned.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">In my experience, the consequences have always been dire.  This system, as outlined by the Housing Rights Service, and sharing the  database, will ensure that landlords with a licence, and residents, will have  access to the register.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Fred Cobain recognised the work that had been undertaken.  Around 11% of the entire housing stock is privately owned, and 40% of the  occupants live in fuel poverty. My experience in North   Belfast is that the lack of regulation and registration means that  rents have increased, and, in the mouth of a credit crunch, families have to  choose whether to pay their rents, heat their homes or eat. Although they were  not mentioned, those are the facts &mdash; it is not a myth. Those families have to  pay rent to landlords on a whim. I know of three families whose housing  conditions are very bad; nevertheless, their rents continue to increase. Many  Members will have similar stories to tell.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I was, therefore, disappointed with Alban Maginness&rsquo;s  contribution &mdash; or lack of contribution. However, I am not surprised,  considering that he and his party &mdash; so-called &ldquo;champions&rdquo; and founder members  of the civil rights movement &mdash; cannot see the principle of demanding a  Government of equality and partnership. He too is from North   Belfast, and I am disappointed that, although he knows the  circumstances in which many of his constituents live, he still makes a cheap  political point.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Anna Lo saw that there was a need to recognise the problems  of this growing sector. She pointed out that some HMOs have so many living in  them that they are becoming a health and safety problem. Furthermore,  deregulation has meant that people, their rents, and their housing conditions  are all vulnerable. We may have to wait until 2013 before the situation is  rectified, and the main thrust of moving the motion was to bring that forward.  We understand that proposals may be introduced in March 2009, but it is  incumbent on us to ensure that the issue is raised, particularly since we have  not seen any real development.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Jonathan Craig pointed out the lack of public- and  private-sector housing, and he is correct. I pointed out that there are good  and bad landlords and other Members referred to that fact. I welcome the fact  that he supports the registration.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Mickey Brady was disappointed with David Simpson&rsquo;s  contribution, as he had dealt with the issue himself. However, a scheme is  needed to deal with the needs of the private-rented sector.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the fact that all Members who spoke, regardless  of the points they were trying to make, have not argued against the  registration.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Michelle McIlveen &mdash; another good landlord from the DUP &mdash;  also welcomed registration, and that appears to be the cross-party view.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">In answer to a question raised by Fra McCann in May, the  Minister outlined that mandatory registration was not a panacea for the  problems, and she reiterated that throughout her remarks. That was one reason  that Sinn F&eacute;in proposed the motion. It may not be a panacea. However, it is  incumbent on us to ensure that we do all in our power to raise the standard of  living by introducing legislation for regulation, particularly for those people  in the private sector who find &mdash; even as we speak &mdash; that costs are rising.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The issue will be on the list of no-day-named motions, with  no changes. That, too, is our prerogative. Whether there will be support from  other Whips to have the motion selected will be a story for a different day.  However, today&rsquo;s motion garnered the support of all of the Whips; therefore, I  am disappointed to hear some point-scoring from some petty individuals in the  House who cannot, for some reason, embrace the sentiments of equality and  partnership in Government to which they signed up in the Programme for  Government.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">However, I am delighted that those Members support the  motion. Sinn F&eacute;in is happy to support both amendments.</p>
	    <p class="TimePeriod">1.45 pm</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Before I put the Question, I again remind Members of  procedure so that they are absolutely clear. If amendment No 1 is made, amendment  No 2 will fall, and I will then put the Question on the motion, as amended.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question, <span style="font-style:normal; ">That  amendment No 1 be made</span>, put and agreed to.</p>

	    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly recognises the intention of the Minister  for Social Development to bring forward legislation to regulate private  landlords; and calls on the Minister to ensure that these regulations will  tackle unfitness in the sector, whilst ensuring that unnecessary bureaucracy is  avoided.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I wanted to raise this issue before the  vote was held, but I could not, so I will do so now. During the debate, several  Members declared an interest as landlords. What is the position as regards  those who voted on the motion? Other Members may have voted today but have not  declared that they are landlords, good or bad, which is a subjective  interpretation.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: There is a requirement on those who speak in a debate to declare  any relevant interest. Other Members will have declared their interests in the  Register of Members&rsquo; Interests.</p>

	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
	    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes the waiting time for POCVA checks to  be processed; further notes that this is adversely affecting child care  centres, amongst other employers; and asks the Secretary of State to  investigate the situation and ensure that applications are processed as a  matter of urgency.</p>

	    <p class="B3BodyText">I remember with chilling clarity the day that little Holly  and Jessica were found, and I remember praying that we would never see the same  thing happen in the Province. I am well aware of the reasons for carrying out  searches and checks, and I want to it to be well understood that I agree  wholeheartedly that such stringent checks must be carried out. However, my  issue is with the length of time that it currently takes to carry them out.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Access Northern Ireland  was established on 1 April 2008, following the enablement of part V of the  Police Act 1997 in Northern    Ireland. Until that point, Northern Ireland was the only part of the United Kingdom  not to have commenced part V, which created a legal framework for the  disclosure of information relating to an individual and their suitability for  employment for a range of purposes.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Three levels of disclosure certificate are available:  basic, standard, and enhanced. Each certificate contains different levels of  information and checks. The legislation created a statutory code for the police  to disclose criminal record information and provide relevant non-conviction  data relating to an individual&rsquo;s prospective employment or voluntary work with  children or vulnerable adults.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">An enhanced disclosure certificate is used for positions  involving children and vulnerable adults, and it also involves checks on  disqualification lists, such as those held by the Department of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety under the Protection of Children and Vulnerable  Adults Order (Northern Ireland) 2003 and, in the education field, under the  Education and Libraries (Northern Ireland) Order 1986. Where an individual has  a previous GB address, checks are made against UK police forces&rsquo; criminal  record information and disqualification lists held in Scotland, such as the  list held under the Protection of Children (Scotland) Act 2003.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Shortly after the commencement of the legislation, it  became clear to all elected representatives that there were serious delays in  the production of enhanced disclosures. I am not condemning those who created  the new system. Many factors &mdash; such as time of year, business processes, and  growing awareness and use of vetting checks &mdash; combined to play a part in  causing delays.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">However, the process must be quickened. Indeed, Paul  Goggins, the Minister of State for Northern Ireland, accepted that in  a press release that he issued following the agency&rsquo;s failure to meet published  performance standards of the production of 90% of enhanced disclosure  certificates within four weeks. We are all aware that it can take between 10  and 12 weeks for checks to take place. Such huge waiting times cause practical  difficulties. Paul Goggins also stated on 30 October 2007, in response to a  question for written answer from my colleague Sammy Wilson, that 6,095 vetting  checks were being processed and that 16,145 checks were made in September 2007.  Demand is great, and the need for the process to be speeded up is equally  great.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Say, for example, that a nursery school in my area  advertises for new staff at the beginning of June. The nursery subsequently  hires a girl and tells her that she can begin work as soon as the check to be  carried out on her is complete. However, a month, then five weeks, passes and  still nothing has arrived. The girl begins to think that if she is not going to  be able to work at the nursery school, she may have to look for another job,  because not many people can afford not to work for a month. Six weeks pass and  the prospective employee has to seek alternative employment. The nursery school  must then begin the entire recruitment process again. In the time that has  elapsed, the school has to turn children away because they do not have enough  staff. It is a double whammy &mdash; the school has lost money and parents have lost  the option of placing their child in the day-care facility.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I declare an interest as a Member of Ards Borough Council.  Ards Borough Council had to cancel summer schemes. The council advertised for  staff in May and put the applications that it received through the POCVA  vetting process. However, the checks were only being cleared in August. That  was too late for the summer scheme, because the summer was over. The council&rsquo;s  investment and the young people&rsquo;s enjoyment had been lost. That situation is  mirrored in playgroups and nursery groups throughout the Ards Borough Council  area.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The constant delays have a domino effect. We often  encourage mothers to get back into work, and, indeed, the perks of part-time  positions can be considerable. However, how can we expect mothers to work if  they have nowhere to place their child? Throughout the summer, staff at  day-care centres relayed their anxieties to me about not being able to  accommodate children because of huge delays in the staff-vetting process. At  one stage, five childcare providers in my constituency &mdash; who look after a total  of more than 150 children &mdash; were awaiting a response from Access Northern Ireland. The  system took far too long and failed to deliver. Some people must wait 10 to 12  weeks for clearance. An increasingly large number of checks has to be processed  every year: more than 130,000 checks had to be performed in 2005; more than  150,000 in 2006; and more than 180,000 in 2007.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The delays are unacceptable and adversely affect businesses  throughout the province. It is not only the realm of childcare that has been  affected. The Department of Education and the Department of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety had to establish an emergency, temporary procedure  to comply with the POCVA requirements. Legislation for nursing homes was  amended, yielding the Establishments and Agencies (Fitness of Workers)  Regulations (Northern    Ireland) 2008. Those regulations permit  employment in areas that were already covered by legislation, pending receipt  of an enhanced disclosure certificate from Access Northern Ireland and  subject to a range of safeguards being adhered to, including appropriate  supervision of a new worker for the period that an enhanced disclosure is  outstanding. The emergency legislation and temporary relaxation of requirements  was necessary to facilitate vital establishments&rsquo; recruitment of adequate staff  numbers. The delays have put residential homes, nursing homes and children&rsquo;s  homes at risk. The Ministers concerned did well to enact legislation to ensure  continuity while people awaited checks to be carried out on them.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">However, those small-business owners did not have the  knowledge or the ability that were required in order to put in place measures  that would ensure the survival of their businesses.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">After the Soham murders, Government passed the Safeguarding  Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 and, in Northern   Ireland, the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups (Northern Ireland)  Order 2007. That legislation is designed to deal with some of the deficiencies  that were identified by the Bichard Inquiry. The legislation is particularly  designed to address the system of vetting checks in order to ensure that a  range of bodies share relevant information.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The 2006 Act established a new Independent Safeguarding  Authority (ISA) for England,  Wales and Northern Ireland,  which administrates new automatic barring arrangements on people who have  certain convictions for harming children or vulnerable adults. The ISA also has  discretionary barring powers in relation to individuals who have engaged in  certain behaviour or pose a risk to children and vulnerable adults.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The new arrangements are novel, in that they introduce a  continuous monitoring element for those who are admitted to the scheme. The  2006 Act and 2007 Order introduce a range of requirements for posts in which  individuals must be a member of the vetting and the barring scheme. Individuals  may use membership of the new scheme for other posts. Therefore, it is much  more portable and, ultimately, efficient, than the present check.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Parents who make private family arrangements and who wish  to check on an individual&rsquo;s barred status may do so. That provides an extra  safeguard in an area that falls outside the existing legislation. The ISA will  also maintain the two Northern    Ireland lists of barred people &mdash; the  children and vulnerable adults lists.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">We must ensure that the present delays are not repeated  when the new scheme commences in October 2009, at which time all applications  to the vetting and barring scheme will be handled. For example, while  non-child-related care organisations in the community and voluntary sector may  at present obtain a vetting check, it is vitally important that problems faced  by Access Northern Ireland  are resolved by the Northern Ireland Office before the implementation of the  scheme in October 2009. At that point, and for the following five years, a  substantial increase in applications is likely to create worse problems.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, the checks must be thorough and  all-encompassing in order to ensure the safety of all vulnerable children and  adults. However, the system in place on the mainland is a better one and one  that the Secretary of State must ensure is introduced and is running smoothly  in the Province by this time next year.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the debate and I commend  the proposer of the motion for securing it. I will not go back over a lot of  the issues and the key facts that he has covered. However, the protection of  children and vulnerable adults is an issue that the Assembly must take seriously,  and has taken seriously over recent years. Supporting this motion in no way  dilutes the Assembly&rsquo;s commitment or record on promoting the protection of  children and vulnerable adults. I am conscious that people who follow this  debate may consider that a backward rather than a forward step is being taken.  That is not what is intended.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with Jim Shannon that the issue of the proper  protection of children and vulnerable adults is at stake. I share the concern  about AccessNI; I wrote to NIO Minister Paul Goggins around 10 days ago  requesting a meeting. I sit on two Committees at which our own Ministers have  dealt with some of the issues that relate to the backlog of 20,000 applications  awaiting AccessNI clearance. With that in mind, my colleague Michelle O&rsquo;Neill  and I have asked Paul Goggins for reassurance that there will be no return to  the bad old days.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">As Jim Shannon said, AccessNI was established in April and  created a legal framework for disclosure among all relevant Departments about  individuals and their suitability for employment. However, it became clear that  there were serious delays, and a review of AccessNI was ordered.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask you to send a record of this  debate to the NIO Minister. He said that the review would be completed by  September, and it is now the first two weeks of October. I am sorry if I caught  you off guard there, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
	    <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">A copy of today&rsquo;s Hansard report should be sent to Paul  Goggins, and we should ask him for a copy of the review that he said would be  completed in September, because that delay has meant several things. First, it  has meant that people applying for jobs have had to wait for months for their  security checks to be processed. Secondly, it has meant that groups are going  to the wall because they do not have the suitable people in post, and, thirdly,  it has meant that some groups have had to operate at a reduced capacity.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">As Jim Shannon rightly pointed out, people applying for  jobs wait for so long that they start to face financial difficulties &mdash; everyone  has bills to pay &mdash; and they have to find employment elsewhere. That creates a  shortfall, as the best person for the job has moved on because they cannot  afford to wait any longer. As a result, the vulnerable adults and children whom  we talk about protecting are losing out a second time round. Therefore, we need  to address the matter.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to take the opportunity to commend our Ministers. It  is important that we do that, because some Departments are directly affected by  the waiting time for checks to be processed. In order to deal with the mess,  the Departments have decided to introduce emergency legislation to begin to  deal with the 20,000 people on the waiting list. I do not want to politicise  the issue, but if policing and justice were devolved, we would have access to  our own local, accountable Minister. We could meet that Minister in the  corridor and tell him or her about the mess and the need to sort it out.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I commend our Ministers, but they are merely introducing  temporary legislation; it is only for the interim period, which means that  applicants will still have to wait for the enhanced disclosure certificate.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  I join my colleague in supporting and congratulating Ministers on their efforts  to address the issue, but does she agree that a consistent approach across all  the Departments is required? For example, the Department of Education does not  require applicants who have been through the vetting process, been accredited  and been in continuous employment to reapply if they wish to change posts. That  simple measure would make a significant contribution to reducing the mammoth  backlog.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  As the proposer of the motion highlighted, the change in arrangements came  about as a result of the brutal murders in Soham. It is striking that one  organisation held relevant information that could have stopped the murderer  from getting a job, but none of the organisations talked to each other. I agree  with the Member &mdash; if people go through a POCVA check, that information must be  spread to other organisations to stop the backlog.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">When we talk about 20,000 people, we are talking about  community and voluntary groups, individuals, schools and councils. All their  projects have been put on the back-burner because of the backlog. The NIO must  spell out to us how it plans to resolve the problem. Paul Goggins gave a  commitment to the Committee for Employment and Learning and to the Health  Committee that the matter would be sorted out by the end of the year. Did he  mean the end of this year, the end of the calendar year, or the end of the  financial year? We need to ask those questions.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">As Jim Shannon said, unless the matter is sorted out now,  the new legislation that is due to come into operation in October 2009 will  make matters worse. I wholeheartedly support the motion, but the NIO must  answer a lot of questions, so I would appreciate the Assembly sending a copy of  today&rsquo;s Hansard report to Paul Goggins. Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann  Comhairle.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I broadly support the motion. The Ulster Unionist Party welcomed the  introduction of the Protection of Children and Vulnerable Adults Order in 2003.  It is of paramount importance that we do everything possible to protect our  children and vulnerable adults from potential predatory individuals or groups  in our society. Therefore, the registration measures and the checks that are  undertaken under the regulations are undeniably necessary. However, there  appears to be a contradiction in introducing legislation while not providing  the level of services and support needed to implement it without a detrimental  effect on those whom we are trying to protect. Under the current operation of  the legislation, children in care centres and people who benefit from certain  community and voluntary groups are suffering due to an inability to register  and, therefore, employ or utilise the necessary people.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">We cannot, and should not, tolerate such a situation.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Voluntary and community groups are experiencing long delays  in receiving information from AccessNI. We are all aware of the resulting  significant staffing problems for groups that are carrying out vital work with  children and vulnerable adults. AccessNI has been unable to cope with the level  of applications that has risen sharply in recent years. It has been reported  that after only six weeks after submission, groups are still waiting for their  applications to appear on the AccessNI system, with no further information  available about the length of time that it will take to process those  applications.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise that Minister of State Goggins has taken steps  to ease the situation in the short term for certain groups. However, that is  not a long-term solution, and it cannot help organisations providing services  such as personal care, one-to-one counselling or services in clients&rsquo; homes. As  we try to tackle child poverty, as we increasingly recognise the importance and  the benefits of early interventions on educational and social outcomes, and as  we try to address mental-health problems, it is unacceptable that AccessNI  continues to fail. Mr Goggins, the Minister of State with responsibility for  criminal justice, has, at least, recognised the problem, but he should be under  no illusion that the steps he has taken in an attempt to get back on track have  so far been inadequate and appear not to be working.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Further to the current problems, the Safeguarding  Vulnerable Groups (Northern Ireland)  Order 2007 will come into effect in October 2009 and will introduce new  safeguarding arrangements across the United Kingdom. AccessNI remains  the gateway to the new system for employees to be registered with the new  independent safeguarding authority. Therefore, it is crucial that we remove the  current problems well in advance of the introduction of the new legislation.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionist Party pledges its complete support for  the new regulations. However, we must have an agency that has the capacity to thoroughly  and efficiently process the applications that it receives. That means that it  must have adequate resources and systems in place to achieve that outcome. I  urge the Secretary of State to investigate the situation and ensure that  applications are processed as a matter of urgency. I support the motion.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Tr&eacute;asla&iacute;m leis na Comhalta&iacute; a thug  an r&uacute;n os comhair an T&iacute; inniu. I thank the Members who tabled the motion. We  must all be careful to state from the outset that our principal concern must be  the protection of children and vulnerable adults. We must be careful that  nothing that we say, propose or suggest today in any way endangers children or  vulnerable adults. Other Members have mentioned that, and I appreciate it.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Having said that, we must have an effective and efficient  system that ensures the protection of children and vulnerable adults, and which  does not reproduce the long delays caused by the previous system &mdash; delays that  have been inherited by Access Northern Ireland, and which are, as we have  heard, causing major difficulties for childcare facilities.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I have been working with several organisations, including  Irish-medium preschool groups, which are awaiting clearance for staff members.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">In one case, if clearance is not received for a new nursery  assistant, a number of children will have to be turned away. It is somewhat  ironic that a system that should be working to protect children is actually  denying them places in educational and childcare facilities. There is something  not quite right about a system that produces that type of result.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The POCVA checks are not the only measures in the system to  protect children and young people, as has been pointed out in the letter of  easement that was sent by the Department of Education and the Department of  Health. I welcome the easement that has been offered by those Departments. That  will, no doubt, help the situation but, in the meantime, there is still a need  to clear the current backlog as quickly as possible, to ensure the required  effectiveness and efficiency of the system to protect children and vulnerable  adults, and also to ensure that educational, health, childcare and community  facilities can continue to operate without disruption, and without the  exclusion of some of those they exist to serve. It is possible to establish a  system that does both, that carries out the necessary checks, and does so  within a sensible time frame.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">We have been told that the backlog faced by Access Northern  Ireland  will be cleared by Christmas &mdash; it will have to be. The patience of employees  and employers is wearing thin, and that is not surprising. I have spoken mostly  of difficulties concerning education, but there are obvious implications for  nursing and care homes, where understaffing is becoming a problem due to the  lack of clearance through the system. The impact of that situation could have  very serious implications for healthcare, if not dealt with post-haste.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Access Northern    Ireland must ensure that its systems work to  full capacity to clear the backlog in the shortest possible time. We have been  told that it will be cleared by Christmas. I sincerely hope that, when  Christmas arrives, Access Northern Ireland will not tell us that the  deadline has slipped to Easter. We need an efficient and effective service,  without the unacceptable delays that are occurring at present. If those delays  are not dealt with, they will continue into the phase of the new legislation,  and that will mean continued difficulties, even under new circumstances.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas, mar a d&uacute;irt m&eacute;, leis na Comhalta&iacute; a mhol  an r&uacute;n seo. T&aacute; m&eacute; f&eacute;in agus mo ph&aacute;irt&iacute; ar son an r&uacute;in, agus t&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go  mbeidh fuascailt ann don fhadhb seo gan m&oacute;r&aacute;n moille agus go mbeidh s&eacute; ar  chumas na n-eagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; at&aacute; th&iacute;os leis an mhoill seo oibrithe a fh&aacute;il gan a  thuillleadh moille. A LeasCheann Comhairle, aonta&iacute;m leis an r&uacute;n agus gabhaim  bu&iacute;ochas leat. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: I  thank Jim Shannon and his colleagues for proposing the motion. We are all  agreed that appropriate protections must be in place for children and  vulnerable adults. Those measures must be effective and robust, but they must  also be efficiently administered, and adequate capacity and resources must be  committed in order to make that happen. Otherwise, children and vulnerable  adults will be deprived of services that they desperately need. That has been  the failure of the current system to date.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The NIO issued a statement in the last week or so, as I am  sure Members are aware, outlining the action that it has been taking to try to  tackle the backlog, and to deal with issues in respect of employment, and so  on, in the interim, along with the Department of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">When I met the Minister a few weeks ago and raised the  issue with him, he said that the clearance process was currently taking around  10 weeks from start to finish. That contrasts with what was expected: that 90%  of applications for a basic check would be completed in two weeks; 90% of applications  for a standard check would be completed in three weeks; and that 90% of  applications for an enhanced check would be completed within four weeks.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Nineteen extra staff have been employed to try to bring the  processing time back down to four weeks by December. That demonstrates how far  the NIO had underestimated the volume of work that AccessNI would receive. That  is cautionary tale for when the regulations are implemented towards the end of  2009. There should be further assessment of the resources that are required so  that the process functions properly.</p>
	    <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Undoubtedly, the teething problems experienced by AccessNI  contributed to the backlog. However, there is anecdotal evidence that, in the  past 18 months, the processing time for applications had been gradually  increasing and that, before AccessNI was established, it was about six weeks.  There are no statistics to support that assertion, but that is the feedback  that I have received. Therefore, there is an underlying difficulty that must be  addressed.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">All youth leaders, volunteers, teachers and other people  who work with children must undergo checks. Those people must undergo a  separate check for each organisation in which they work, which has contributed  significantly to the amount of applications &mdash; often, multiple applications are  being processed for one person. I raised the issue of joined-up thinking in the  arrangements with AccessNI, because, if someone has already been cleared to  work with young people in one organisation and wants to work with young people  in another organisation, they have to reapply. In its response, AccessNI said  that the checks were valid only at the point at which the certificate was  issued, which raises questions about continuity in the system and how  information that arises after someone has been checked is fed back to the  organisation for which that person works.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Members have correctly focused on those involved in  childcare centres and in other paid employment with children and vulnerable  adults, because the waiting time has a direct implication on their earning  capacity. Many people in the voluntary sector who, like me, volunteer in  organisations such as the Guides, Scouts and many others have been affected.  Churches that provide valuable diversionary activities for young people have  also been affected by the delays in the processing of applications. There is a  timing issue, because the problems with AccessNI coincided with summer  activities, such as the local council summer schemes that Jim Shannon  mentioned. However, the backlog has stretched into the autumn session of many  of the voluntary youth organisations, and it is affecting them.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  As the Member is broadening the scope, she may be interested to learn that a  body as august as the PSNI had difficulty getting an entire cohort of trainee  officers through the checks. That highlights how widespread the problem is.  Will the Member agree that it is important for people to realise what the  checks consist of? At a basic level, the checks are no more than people saying  that they are who they say they are. We must get the process right and invest  the appropriate resources.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: I  thank the Member for his intervention. As I am being allowed to speak beyond my  five minutes, I assume that I have been given extra time to respond. I agree  entirely with the Member: there must be clarity. However, the AccessNI website  does not offer that clarity; it is very unclear on what a basic check entails.  Most organisations that undertake basic checks think that, at the very least,  there has been a check against an individual&rsquo;s police records, but that is not  the case. That raises serious questions about the robustness of the system in  the minds of those who use it to try to protect young people. I hope that the  legislation addresses those questions. AccessNI could help the situation by  providing more detailed information on certain issues.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a serious issue about allowing people &mdash;</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member draw her remarks to a close?</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  The vast majority of those who work with young people and vulnerable adults do  so for the right reasons. It is important that the checks are robust so that  those who might abuse their position are not allowed to do so.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  The delays in completing the appropriate background checks, and the temporary  measures to reduce those delays, could expose the most vulnerable people in  society to an unnecessary risk. That is a concern for my party and me.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Continuity of care can be guaranteed only by ensuring that  there is a readily available pool of suitably qualified employees to fill those  vacancies.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I know of care homes and childcare facilities that are  unable to maximise their operating capacity due to a lack of staff, partly as a  result of the lengthy wait for confirmation of an applicant&rsquo;s suitability to  work in such an environment. I have been told that many people who applied for  work in those sectors found employment elsewhere before the required checks  were completed and clearance to work given, thereby creating an additional  recruitment problem. The only way to rectify that situation is to have a  process that is quick, accurate and ensures ease of recruitment for employers.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">These delays have an adverse impact on prospective  employees and employers. It is totally unacceptable for those such as teachers,  classroom assistants, taxi drivers and bus drivers seeking jobs in childcare  provision, nursing homes and esidential homes to be held back from employment  due to delays in background checks. Those areas of employment need staff, and  need them quickly. There are advertisements for jobs in some of those sectors  every week in the local press. I appreciate that the necessary approval will  take longer for people who are applying for work but are not UK-born. However,  a means must be found in order to speed up that process, too.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The delays that people are experiencing are denying the  sectors that look after the most vulnerable in society the care and security  that they need.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  With regard to the Member&rsquo;s point about people from outside the UK: is he aware  that it is almost impossible to file checks, that there is no way of doing so  legally, and, given that we have a land border, that that is a significant  loophole in the system?</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  I agree entirely with the Member.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Delays in checks are hampering employers and, it seems, are  making people apply for employment outside the sector.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The Secretary of State may well not wish to examine the  current ridiculous and deplorable situation. If he does not, however, that is a  reflection on his commitment, rather than this Assembly&rsquo;s, to changing the  system for the better. I urge the Secretary of State to hold an urgent inquiry  into the problems that are being experienced, and to ensure that recommendations  presented as a result of such an inquiry are treated as a priority for  implementation.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion, and commend Mr Shannon for bringing  it to the House.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the motion. The main issues  and problems that surround POCVA have been dealt with by Jim Shannon, Sue  Ramsey and other Members. There is absolutely no doubt that people who work  with children and vulnerable adults need to be properly vetted. That is  essential. However, it is the logistics of carrying that out, and particularly  the time taken, that is causing a huge problem. The problem is ongoing,  affecting potential employers and employees.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Naomi Long spoke about anecdotal evidence. In 2007, I dealt  with a case concerning a local cr&egrave;che where, because of the delays involved in  workers being vetted, the employer was on the verge of having to close down,  thereby losing the employer&rsquo;s livelihood and several much-needed jobs.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">It was hoped that the advent of Access Northern Ireland would  go some way to solving the problem. Unfortunately, that has not happened.  Immediate priority must be given to the whole area of POCVA; there must not be  a half-hearted attempt to try to resolve the problem. A figure of 20,000-plus  delays was mentioned, and that that would be sorted out by Christmas. With the  best will in the world, however, that is unlikely to happen.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">A point that was raised, and which needs to be reinforced,  is that a POCVA check does not carry-over from one employer to the next, even  if the period is just a few weeks.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Recently, I dealt with a case in which someone had received  a POCVA certificate from the Southern Education and Library Board. Two weeks  later, that person got a job in a playschool. Social services insisted that the  individual go through the entire process again. In that case, the employer was  placed under severe pressure because of staff shortages. That situation has  continued.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I live in a border constituency. Obviously, workers in the  area travel back and forth a lot. Perhaps an all-island approach to POCVA  checks should be taken. People move from social-services jobs in the North to  similar jobs in the South, and vice versa. As so many different types of jobs  are involved, the entire area of POCVA checks has become complicated. A simple  solution is for a centralised body to deal with those checks.</p>

	    <p class="H3SectionHeading">Office of the First Minister and deputy First  Minister</p>
	    <p class="H4StageHeading">Economic Downtown/Credit Crunch</p>
	    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr  McCallister </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and deputy First  Minister if it has met with the Minister for Finance and Personnel to discuss  the implications for the economy of the economic downturn and the credit  crunch.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO579/09>(AQO 579/09)</a></p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister (Mr P Robinson)</strong>: Unfortunately, it is apparent that the economic  downturn and the credit crunch are not fleeting events; their effects are likely  to endure, and the crisis may deepen even further. We continue to experience  falling property prices coupled with high inflation, food and fuel prices.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">That challenge can only be managed effectively at Executive  level. I have discussed the implications of the economic downturn with the  Minister of Finance and Personnel on several occasions. On 18 September, I met  ministerial colleagues, including Minister Dodds, to discuss those issues.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Additionally, the deputy First Minister and I have met  local interest groups to listen to their concerns and gather their ideas for  mitigating measures that we might put in place to offset the worst effects of  the economic downturn. In preparation for those, we have drawn on advice and  information across ministerial portfolios.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The deputy First Minister and I intend that addressing  cost-of-living pressures should become a key item of Executive business, to  ensure that we collectively address the problem across the full width of  Government.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Have the First Minister and the Executive identified which programmes at the  bottom of the Executive&rsquo;s priorities will be sacrificed first if the  Government&rsquo;s peak income targets are not realised because of the economic  downturn and the credit crunch?</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: Capital budgets and current expenditure must be considered. There  could be an impact on the capital expenditure if, for instance, land and  property sales were to provide less income than previously expected.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Significant increases in revenue costs can also have  implications. Each Minister and Department will have to manage those issues.  During the course of the monitoring rounds, they will acquaint the Finance  Minister with the pressures that they are under, and he will attempt &mdash; by using  underspend &mdash; to meet the pressures in the system.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  Has the First Minister raised concerns with Department of Finance and Personnel  about the successful legal challenge to the Central Procurement Directorate  over the way in which public contracts are awarded to private-sector  contractors &mdash;</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. I remind the House that supplementary questions must relate to the  original question. The Member is straying beyond the remit of the original  question. By all means, he should ask his supplementary question, but try to  relate it to the original question.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I caught the gist of the Member&rsquo;s supplementary question.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I have not spoken to the Finance Minister about the issue,  but I have spoken to the chief executive of the Strategic Investment Board  (SIB) about it. The Member will be aware that two legal challenges have been  made, concerning systems and procedures in procurement policy. We are  considering whether it is appropriate to appeal those decisions: that is being  done within the Finance Department. The other option is to move to more  conventional means of procurement.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  appreciate what the First Minister has just said, but it seems to me that there  are two issues. First, what discussions has his Office, or any part of the  Executive, had with the banks with regard to support for the business sector &mdash;  especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) &mdash; given the difficulty that  we currently have in attracting external investment? Secondly, given what he is  saying about procurement and the complete shortage of private finance, how does  he propose to go about conventional means of procurement in the current  economic climate?</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: First, the deputy First Minister and I have had a meeting, not  just with the banks, but with the other lending institutions in Northern Ireland.  There was a readiness and a willingness on their part to lend money, and they  indicated to us that they had money to lend. In present circumstances it is  obvious that they may be more careful about their requirements before they lend  money.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The big issue is the building of confidence because, until  last night at least, the banks were not lending money even to each other. That  must be freed up, and steps have been taken internationally. It is a global  problem, and the role that we have is only on the edges, particularly with the  banks and lending institutions. We have done everything that we can to  encourage them to get the system moving and to ensure that money flows within Northern Ireland.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, regarding the Member&rsquo;s question on procurement  policy, the Executive have identified in their 10-year investment strategy for  Northern Ireland, an average of &pound;2 billion per year of capital spend in the  public sector. That funding came directly from HM Treasury. In the present  economic climate, therefore, that should remain unaffected. It becomes  important that we roll out, perhaps in an accelerated fashion, the public spend  that we are planning. Using conventional means might just be a method of  bringing that out more expeditiously.</p>
	    <p class="H5StageHeading">Economic Difficulties</p>
	    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr  Hamilton </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister  what steps the Executive is taking to deal with the present economic  difficulties.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO570/09>(AQO 570/09)</a></p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: Even now, it is unlikely that we have seen the full scale of the  current economic crisis. The intensity of the storm and the damage that it  brings in its wake appears to travel between markets. The main focus of  attention has recently shifted back to the banking sector. The remedial action  that was announced last week by Governments and central banks across the world  is to be welcomed.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Locally, Executive Ministers have been working to mitigate  the worst effects of the economic slowdown on our business sector, local people  and especially on those members of society who are in greatest need. The  welfare of the people of Northern    Ireland is our primary concern. In that  respect, we have already acted, and we intend to do more. Members will know  that this year&rsquo;s regional rate increase for domestic property has been frozen,  and that will be maintained for the next two years. As a result of the decisions  that the Executive have taken on the regional rate and water charges, the  average household will be almost &pound;1,000 better off over this year and the next  two years. Executive Ministers have also flagged our intention to look again at  the options for a further deferment of the introduction of water charges.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister for Regional Development has announced the  extension of the free bus pass scheme. Since 2007, some 240,000 people aged 65  or over have been taking advantage of free bus and rail services. From 1  October, a further 90,000 individuals aged 60 to 64 will be entitled to free  travel in Northern Ireland.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  has brought forward proposals to cut the cost of a prescription in Northern  Ireland to &pound;3 in January 2009, and for prescriptions to be free of charge by  April 2010.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department for Social Development has also initiated  schemes to promote affordable homes.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI)  will continue the provision of its successful face-to-face debt advice service  to citizens for the next three years. On 25 September, DETI also announced a  package worth &pound;5 million to help Invest Northern Ireland&rsquo;s clients to weather the  economic slowdown.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, the Department of Agriculture and Rural  Development and the Department for Social Development have announced an  increase of &pound;400,000 to the warm homes scheme budget to fund energy-efficiency  improvements for rural homes. We have also indicated our intention to address  the proposals put forward by the fuel poverty task force and the equal pay  issue inherited from the previous Administrations. The latter alone would  represent almost 1% of our whole GDP, or the equivalent of around 2,000 jobs in  our economy.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The deputy First Minister and I intend to meet the  Strategic Investment Board to review the planned roll-out of our capital  programme and to assess the opportunities for supporting the local construction  industry. It is widely acknowledged that, used intelligently, our public  expenditure plans can provide some resilience to the local economy. Members can  be assured that the Executive will do all in their power to protect the  interests of people in Northern    Ireland.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I thank the First Minister for his comprehensive answer. He is well aware that  the construction industry &mdash; one of the crucial sectors of the economy &mdash; is  under particular pressure, with estimates of thousands of job losses by  Christmas, and evidence already of job losses at the raw-materials end of the  sector. The First Minister has already mentioned this matter in a previous  answer, but can he outline exactly how those major public infrastructure  projects can be rolled out and accelerated as quickly as possible to give a  boost to that important sector?</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The Member is right. During the latter part of last week, I  received an email that indicated that around 25% of jobs in the aggregates  sector had already been lost, with the fear that more job losses were to come  before the end of the year. If that part of the construction industry is being  so affected, one cannot help but conclude that the same impact will be felt  elsewhere.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Representatives from the construction industry met the  deputy First Minister and myself some weeks ago, and we considered a series of  possibilities, one of which was the acceleration of the capital spend programme  that I referred to in my answer to Mr Ford. It is worth pointing out that that  programme is more substantial than has ever been the case in Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  history, and it is a programme that could go a long way to making the  difference.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The construction industry was keen to be provided with a  long-term vision of what measures will come on stream so that it can be  involved in the planning process. We have been in touch with the Scottish and  Welsh Executives and, by and large, the steps that they are examining are in  line with the decisions that we have taken in various Departments: reshaping  our capital spending; adjusting the planning and regulatory environment to help  individuals and businesses; targeting support at the most vulnerable  individuals and businesses; and alleviating the effects of rising energy prices  and promoting energy efficiency.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Those are the four key drivers on which the Executive can  have an impact. We can have very little impact on the wider global economy and  the issues that flow from that, but I have outlined the issues affecting Northern Ireland  in respect of which a local hand can make a difference.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  The First Minister raised the issue of what the Executive were doing to  alleviate the effects of the present economic difficulties on the most  vulnerable people in the community. Can he offer us an estimation of when the  anti-poverty strategy will be adopted by the Executive, so that a long-term  view can be taken on all of those matters?</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I am sure that the Executive will want to look at that matter  very closely during their meeting on Thursday.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I hope that that meeting takes place. It is, in my view,  essential that we get down to business, and that business gets done. I was  before the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy First  Minister, and those matters were referred to. There is no foot dragging, either  on the part of the deputy First Minister or myself, in respect of that  strategy. My ministerial colleagues will want to give their approval to the  strategy, and I look forward to that happening.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I welcome the emphasis placed by the  Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister (OFMDFM) on bringing  forward capital-spend projects to help the construction industry. Given the  current global economic crisis, has the First Minister met the Taoiseach, the  British Prime Minister, or other leaders within the European Union, to make  suggestions and to bring forward proposals? If so, what has been the substance  of those meetings?</p>	    
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The deputy First Minister and I met the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom,  and we talked about a series of financial matters. Later this week, I intend to  meet the Prime Minister of the Irish   Republic, and I look  forward to that engagement.</p>
	    <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
	    <p class="H5StageHeading">Utility Regulator</p>
	    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr B  McCrea </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister for  its assessment of its recent meeting with the Utility Regulator.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO581/09>(AQO  581/09)</a></p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: It is clear that the credit crunch, coupled with an increased  global demand for oil, has had a profound effect on the price of electricity  and gas. The responsibility for energy policy lies primarily with the  Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment. However, in one of a series of  meetings on the cost of living, on 24 September 2008, the deputy First Minister  and I met the Utility Regulator followed by representatives of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  energy sector. A range of issues concerning the local energy market was  discussed, and the deputy First Minister and I gained further understanding of  how the energy sector operates. The Utility Regulator agreed to send us some  further ideas to explore, about how to mitigate the hardship caused by  increasing energy prices. The potential for renewable energy to play a bigger  role in the future supply chain was also discussed. It was a constructive  meeting about a complex issue.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">In separate meetings with local energy companies, it was  clear that they are conscious of the price differential that has opened up  between Northern Ireland and  Great Britain.  They too agreed to consider, and submit ideas on, what steps the Assembly could  take to ease the burden of high energy prices.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I am pleased that the Utility Regulator has decided to submit some ideas.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the First Minister agree that energy policy is integral  to any future economic policy? The price of energy is important; it is the  bottom line for many people, and it is at the heart of competitiveness. Will he  accept, therefore, that it is OFMDFM&rsquo;s role to develop a strategic energy  policy? If so, does he have such a policy, and what is it?</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: Had the Member been in the House during the previous mandate of  the Assembly, he would know that energy policy was originally in the remit of  the Department for Regional Department for which I was the Minister. His leader  strongly argued that the policy should be transferred to the Department of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment. He is, therefore, at odds with his leader. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order, Members.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  I remind the First Minister of the letter that he received at the start of  September from the deputy First Minister. One of several proposals to deal with  fuel poverty included in that letter was the possibility of repatriating the  VAT windfalls that accrue to the British Treasury. Will the First Minister  confirm that he raised that possibility at his recent meeting with Gordon  Brown?</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: My recollection is that the deputy First Minister raised several  such issues during the meeting with the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.  The Assembly must consider providing an overall package to assist the people of  Northern Ireland.  There is no simple switch to flick that will suddenly make the situation  better. The crisis will remain with us for some considerable time and,  therefore, a co-ordinated, long-term approach is required.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not object to asking people for assistance, but that  is not enough. The Assembly has power over mechanisms that can be used to  alleviate some of the difficulties that people are experiencing, and should  not, therefore, rely solely on others.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  Will the First Minister agree that people are becoming increasingly bewildered  by how rising oil prices pushed up electricity prices but falling oil prices  have no effect on bringing them down? In that context, will he accept that the  commissioned review of the process of setting electricity tariffs will have  little or no effect on price? The review will assess how the tariffs were set  rather than change the price of electricity.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: People are right to wonder about that conundrum. However, a  further conundrum is that Northern    Ireland has gas-fired, not oil-fired, power  stations. Therefore, the price of oil should not be the key factor. It is  important that the Utility Regulator and the Assembly deal with several issues.  The review was set up as a result of a request from the deputy First Minister  to the Utility Regulator, who, in turn, has appointed Douglas McIldoon to carry  it out. It is important to use his experience and cross-check the furnace of  current prices.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Purvis</strong>:  The House recognises the need for an overall package to tackle the issues.  Electricity and gas produced profits of over &pound;14 million for the gas company  and over &pound;81 million for the electricity company. Given that, what discussion  took place during the Minister&rsquo;s meeting with the Utility Regulator about  reducing those companies&rsquo; profit margins?</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The deputy First Minister and I raised that point &mdash; as did some  of our advisors &mdash; with the Utility Regulator, which argued &mdash; and do not pin it  on me &mdash; that the profits are required in order to fund further research and  further capital investment in the industry. Therefore, that profit level is  considered necessary. It will be interesting to discover whether Douglas  McIldoon agrees with that assertion.</p>
	    <p class="H5StageHeading">Maze Site</p>
	    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr  Molloy </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister to  provide an update on the development of the Maze site. <a name=AQO638/09>(AQO 638/09)</a></p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The proposed Maze/Long Kesh development is the largest and most  complex project to be considered in recent years. Everyone has a major interest  in ensuring that the lands at Maze/Long Kesh are used to benefit the entire  community.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The extensive programme to demolish buildings and structures  is almost complete. A first phase of substantial remediation work, which will  remove contamination &mdash; such as diesel oil spillages &mdash; at part of the site, is  almost complete, and we hope to embark on a second phase shortly. The  demolition and remediation work is essential in order to prepare the site for  any kind of development. The deputy First Minister and I are considering  proposals for the development of the former prison based on the 2006 master  plan, and we will report to the Executive when we reach a conclusion.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Given that the Long Kesh/Maze  development should be under construction by now, does the First Minister agree  that the delay has cost construction jobs, cost us the opportunity to stage  major events in the 2012 Olympics, and endangered our involvement in the World  Police and Fire Games?</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: That is all very well, but the accounting officers in OFMDFM and  the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL) indicated that they could  not sign the project off with a clean bill of health in terms of value for  money. They agreed that the Executive would have to consider extraneous, non-financial  issues in order to justify the project. Some blame should be placed on direct  rule Ministers, who took the process out of sync and approached bidders before  the completion of the business-case process.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">However, OFMDFM is determined to resolve the Maze/Long Kesh  site difficulties. I do not accept that jobs have been lost. Any building on  the site must be constructed and developed in the interest of the surrounding  area and Northern Ireland  as a whole. First-class development of the site is important, and its various  components are being considered. Moreover, construction jobs will be created in  the building of a stadium or stadia, whether on that site or elsewhere.  Furthermore, the operation of that stadium or stadia will create more jobs.  Jobs are not lost, but a decision must be taken on the issue. Therefore, I hope  that progress will be made.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>:  Does the First Minister agree that the best way for the Executive to take  decisions on the development of the Maze site or other sites, or any loss or  creation of jobs, is for Ministers to meet around the Executive table?</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: That is by far the best way. Needless to say, there is a  requirement on OFMDFM, because it has ministerial responsibility for the site.  There is a ministerial responsibility on the Minister of Culture, Arts and  Leisure to introduce proposals that meet the value-for-money and affordability  requirements that the Department of Finance and Personnel set.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The process requires work to be done outside the Executive,  but by far the best way in which to resolve any differences is to meet around  the Executive table with ministerial colleagues.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>:  Will the Minister reveal what viable options are under consideration to build a  stadium somewhere other than the former Maze Prison site, considering that jobs  are needed for people in a construction industry that is at an all-time low?</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I would be straying outside my ministerial responsibility were I  to responded to question. The Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure has  indicated that he wants to make a statement to the Assembly on those issues,  but he first wants to take the views of Executive colleagues into  consideration, and he wants them to be aware of the proposals. It would be  wrong for me to usurp his position and pre-empt what he might say.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The options, however, are obvious: a stadium could be built  at the Maze site; a stadium could be built elsewhere; several stadia could be  built elsewhere; or nothing could happen at all. I hope that the final option  is not one that is being seriously considered, given the state of our major  sports stadia in Northern    Ireland. I hope that options for a national  stadium or numerous stadia are being considered, because those will provide  jobs.</p>
	    <p class="H5StageHeading">Strategic Investment Board</p>
	    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr  Newton </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister for  its assessment of the role of the Strategic Investment Board in delivering  major infrastructure projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO568/09>(AQO  568/09)</a></p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The Executive&rsquo;s investment strategy that the Assembly approved in  January 2008 is the largest-ever commitment to infrastructure development in Northern Ireland.  By 2018, we plan to invest almost &pound;20 billion to tackle the legacy of decades  of underinvestment that we inherited.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">That determined action will put in place the assets that  are required to support high-quality public services, to regenerate communities  and to enhance the economic competitiveness that is essential to sustaining  jobs and prosperity. Just over five years ago, infrastructure investment was  less than &pound;1 billion per annum. Last year, it amounted to almost &pound;1&middot;4 billion,  and it is planned to reach &pound;2 billion by the end of this Budget period.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">That is a measure of our recent success and of our ambition  to go further, but delivering the investment strategy involves more than simply  spending the money. Our key commitments must be delivered on time, to a  high-quality standard and at value for money. It also means investing in  projects that offer a good return. Expectations are high, but we must not  underestimate the challenges. We now face global financial and economic  difficulties. Our local construction industry, in particular, is looking to our  investment programme to support local jobs through difficult times ahead, and  to provide opportunities for more apprenticeships and training. We are  determined to ensure that the investment strategy helps to meet those calls.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The Strategic Investment Board (SIB) performs a vital role  in the development, monitoring and communication of our investment strategy,  and &mdash; in moving forward &mdash; our key infrastructure-investment programmes. It  helps Departments to deliver major projects across the full spectrum of  services, including healthcare, the environment, schools and colleges, roads,  water, waste and public administration.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The SIB provides expert commercial, legal and  project-delivery advice to Departments, drawing on its advisers&rsquo; extensive  experience of major infrastructure procurements. That advice helps us to ensure  that the best deals are obtained for the public purse and that risks are  identified and appropriately managed. We recently met the SIB chairman and its  chief executive to discuss the progress that is being made in implementing the  investment strategy and to consider what additional steps could be taken to  introduce capital projects.</p>

	    <p class="H4StageHeading">Street Lighting: Rural Areas</p>
	    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mrs D  Kelly </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development when he will review the  criteria for the provision of street lighting in rural areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO676/09>(AQO  676/09)</a></p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development (Mr Murphy)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.  When considering the provision of street lighting in rural areas, my  Department&rsquo;s Roads Service applies two main criteria: the housing density in  the community, including public buildings with significant night-time use, and  road safety, in circumstances in which street lighting might contribute to a  reduction of night-time accidents.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Roads Service last reviewed the policy for the provision of  road lighting in rural areas in 2002 in order to take account of public  buildings with significant night-time use. The demand for more rural lighting  must be balanced against environmental impacts, such as night-sky light  pollution and increased carbon dioxide emissions; the financial cost of  providing and maintaining additional public-lighting installations must also be  considered.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Roads Service previously considered two scenarios for  extending rural street-lighting criteria: first, to extend the eligible length  of road from 200m to 300m, and, secondly, to reduce the number of dwellings &mdash;  including public dwellings &mdash; that are counted as two houses from 10 to eight.  Both measures would reduce the housing density required to qualify for  lighting, and it was estimated that those measures could enable approximately  180 additional locations to be eligible for street lighting, broadly costing an  additional &pound;3 million. There are no plans for a further review of rural,  public-lighting criteria.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Many rural dwellers will be disappointed that there will be no review,  particularly in light of the impact of PPS 14 on rural areas and the loss of  any opportunity for housing growth.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I am interested in what the Minister claims to be  night-time light pollution. One can only assume that that comes from increased energy  consumption, because I cannot conceive of how light could contribute to  pollution in the night sky.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Are the set criteria not subjective, rather than objective?  There appears to be a lack of clarity throughout various sectors about how the  criteria should be implemented. Therefore, in light of PPS 14, will the  Minister reconsider his decision to review street lighting?</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: There is a measurement of night-time light pollution,  and I shall leave it for, perhaps, the Minister of the Environment to explain  to the Member in more detail. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> Nevertheless, light pollution is a recognised factor in the countryside and it  changes the character of many rural areas.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">When PPS 14 is changed &mdash; as we hope that it will be &mdash; that  may increase the number of qualifying public buildings in rural areas and allow  more of them to meet the criteria. The Member knows that the amount that we can  spend on such matters is limited. The range of requests is always greater than  the measures for which we have adequate resources. Therefore, we must set  criteria, against which we must prioritise our spending.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member wants more street lighting in rural areas; her  colleague has submitted a question about footpaths, and I am sure that he wants  more of them in rural areas. Last week, some of the Member&rsquo;s colleagues  proposed a motion on traffic-calming measures, in which they wished every  residential area to have 20 mph zones and traffic-calming measures. That is all  wonderful, and if those Members had argued for my Department to receive several  hundred million pounds more during the Budget debate, at least their approach  would have been consistent. However, it is all very well to argue for such  things, and for spending more money, after the Budget has been set. The  Department spends as much as possible under the criteria, and it attempts to do  as good a job as it can with its limited budget.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  The Minister said that health and safety was a matter that had influenced his  response. Will he tell Members about the street-lighting policy, particularly  with regard to health and safety, for footpaths that lead to churches and,  indeed, chapels in the countryside? Why is there sometimes a footpath with no  street lighting and street lighting with no footpath? Perhaps, now is the time  to co-ordinate the provision of both facilities.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I am sure that Roads Service will seek to co-ordinate  those matters when it can.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Roads Service may sometimes inherit developments where  there is a footpath that has no lighting, or vice versa. As I said, public  safety is a key criterion. When public safety is being examined, it is a sad  but necessary fact that accident history has to play a part in deciding where  limited resources are spent. Therefore, areas that have more of an accident  history are prioritised.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Chapels, churches or other public buildings are treated as  two dwellings when using the equation that is based on 10 houses. In 2002, a  review was carried out to consider public buildings that have a specific  night-time use. It may not be the case that churches or chapels have the same  amount of night-time use as some community halls or sports facilities, but that  is how they are included in the calculation. However, public safety is a key  element; therefore, the accident history of an area is taken into account.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his robust first answer to the question &mdash; I am sure that  it is not necessary for a Member from County Antrim to refer one of the Members  from Armagh to the observatory and the effects that light pollution has on  astronomy.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Has the Minister obtained an assessment from the Northern  Ireland Environment Agency &mdash; or the Environment and Heritage Service, as it was  in its previous life &mdash; of the effect of increasing amounts of street lighting  in rural areas on nocturnal wildlife and the potential threat that such  lighting may be to our environment?</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: When providing street lighting in rural areas, the  effect of night-time light pollution is one issue that is taken into  consideration. I am sure that Roads Service will take advice from environmental  agencies when determining the effect that such pollution will have. I am not  sure whether Roads Service takes advice on the impact that it could have on  wildlife, but I will try to ascertain that and will correspond with the Member  on the matter.</p>
	    <p class="H5StageHeading">Roads Resurfacing</p>
	    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr W  Clarke </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development if there has been a  reduction in the Roads Service Southern Division&rsquo;s budget for roads  resurfacing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO658/09>(AQO 658/09)</a></p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Since the start of the financial year, there has not  been a reduction in my Department&rsquo;s Roads Service 2008-09 budget of &pound;4&middot;3  million for Roads Service resurfacing activities in the southern division.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Will the Minister outline the criteria  for the allocation of the roads budget for each region?</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: In distributing the resources that are available for  road maintenance, allocations are made to the four Roads Service divisions on  the basis of need, using a range of weighted indicators that are tailored to  each maintenance activity. Divisions use those indicators when apportioning  costs across council areas to ensure that there is, as far as possible, an  equitable distribution of funds.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cobain</strong>: I  am glad that Mr Clarke raised the issue. Will the Minister state how often he  intends to have trunk roads in Northern    Ireland resurfaced?</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: There is a policy schedule for the resurfacing of  trunk roads. Obviously, if there are particular problems on trunk roads that  are creating a danger, those roads would move up the priority list. If the Member,  who is the Chairperson of the Committee for Regional Development, so wishes, I  will ask the Department to furnish him with the policy schedule for the  resurfacing of trunk roads.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  Coming as I do from the southern division, I understand why Mr Clarke asked  that question. People were hopeful that direct rule Ministers&rsquo; neglect of rural  roads would be dealt with by the Assembly, but that has not been the case.  Roads in South Down are in the worst condition that they have ever been in. Does  the Minister agree with my assessment of the condition of the roads, and will  he state how he proposes to deal with that?</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: That depends on how far back in history the Member  wants to go; I am not sure whether he is comparing the condition of the roads  in South Down with their condition 10 years ago or 100 years ago. I would  hazard a guess that they are in better condition now than they were 100 years  ago.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">My response to the Member is the same as that which I gave  to his party colleague a few minutes ago &mdash; DRD&rsquo;s budget was allocated after a  Budget debate in which the Member and all other Members had an opportunity to  speak. Since the Budget was allocated, I have received requests &mdash; particularly  from Mr Bradley&rsquo;s party &mdash; for more street lighting and footpaths, 20 mph zones  to be created in every residential area, and, now, for a substantial uplift in  the money that is spent on rural roads. Perhaps I would be in a better position  to deal with some of those issues had I heard those arguments during the Budget  debate.</p>
	    <p class="H5StageHeading">Derry/Londonderry to Belfast Rail Service</p>
	    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr  Durkan </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development what progress has been  made in acquiring land from the Ministry of Defence for a passing loop for the  Derry/Londonderry to Belfast  rail service.&nbsp; <a name=AQO644/09>(AQO 644/09)</a></p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The location of a passing loop is yet to be decided.  Options are being considered, and Ballykelly is one such option.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">It is hoped that sufficient information will be available  by November 2008 to allow a preferred option to be selected. It is intended  that the passing loop will be constructed during the Derry/Coleraine track  relay.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company has  registered an interest with the Ministry of Defence (MOD) and Land and Property  Services to purchase land on behalf of Translink. Based on discussions with the  relevant parties, it is my understanding that it will be the new year before  any firm decisions are made on possible disposal.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his answer. When examining location options, will the  determination be made on the availability of land or on engineering logistics?  When does the Minister expect to know the preferred location for the passing  loop?</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: OFMDFM is progressing the issue of how the land at  Ballykelly may be transferred or sold. It is not part of Translink&rsquo;s  consideration, as it is examining the project solely on engineering grounds.  That issue could have an impact when it comes to acquisitions, but at present  Translink is considering only engineering solutions.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText" style="margin-top:2.85pt;">We want to ensure that the MOD is  aware of the interest, as the site may be chosen for the passing loop. We  should know by next month when the preferred option is selected. Should  Ballykelly be selected, discussions should be entered into in early 2009. We  have registered an interest with the MOD to ensure that nothing happens to the  land that would make a solution more difficult.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName" style="margin-top:2.85pt;"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>: Is the Minister actively considering the provision  of a rail halt at the airport serving the city of Londonderry and further afield?</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName" style="margin-top:2.85pt;"><strong>The Minister for Regional Development</strong>: That issue has been raised  several times, as have rail halts at both Belfast  airports. There are criteria for the number of passengers who might use such a  service; Aldergrove may be moving towards that target, but the City of Derry  Airport is a long way from it.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText" style="margin-top:2.85pt;">We want to ensure that we improve  and upgrade the line between Derry and Coleraine after the upgrade from  Ballymena to Coleraine to ensure that a decent rail service is provided between  Belfast and Derry.  A rail halt at the City of Derry Airport will not be considered as part of that  project. I am happy to keep the matter under review; however, given the  criteria used to consider the International   Airport, the City of  Derry Airport is a long way from meeting those criteria.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName" style="margin-top:2.85pt;"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>: Is the Minister committed to the use of railways as a  transportation method for the future? Are there any other &mdash;perhaps more  imaginative &mdash; proposals for the Belfast to Londonderry route? Will those proposals include linking  Antrim, Lisburn and Belfast?</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName" style="margin-top:2.85pt;"><strong>The Minister for Regional Development</strong>: The Member will have heard  other questions and debates about the Belfast to  Derry line. An example of my commitment to  that line is the fact that I lifted the investment ban between Coleraine and Derry when I came into office. That allowed the  investment for the passing loop at Ballykelly and the improvement in the track  relay between Derry and Coleraine.  Furthermore, it has allowed commuter traffic into Derry  before 9 am for the first time. It has allowed for additional trains on the Belfast to Derry line and has improved the service between  Belfast and Derry.  Those are examples of my commitment to rail travel.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText" style="margin-top:2.85pt;">Rail travel is a very expensive  option in relation to infrastructure, but I am committed to it. If that leads  us to examine the Knockmore line and the connections between Antrim, Lisburn  and Belfast, so  be it. We have secured investment for the Belfast  to Derry line. There are ongoing improvement  works between Belfast  and Ballymena and Ballymena and Coleraine. We want to secure and continue the  work from Coleraine to Derry until 2011, thus improving the service on the Belfast to Derry line.</p>
	    <p class="H5StageHeading">Belfast   International Airport:  Signage</p>
	    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr  Hamilton </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development if he will consider  the erection of signage for Belfast   International Airport  at the A1 at Sprucefield, directing drivers along the M1 and A26 Moira to Nutts  Corner road.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO536/09>(AQO 536/09)</a></p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Roads Service carried out a preliminary assessment of  the existing directional signage from the A1 at Sprucefield to Belfast International Airport  in December 2007. That assessment concluded that new signage via the M1  motorway and the A26 would be appropriate. Roads Service has identified the  signs along the A1 and A101 routes that need to be replaced. It is expected  that the design, procurement and erection of those replacement signs will be  completed by the end of March 2009.</p>
	    <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s response. Does he agree that it is important that  those gaps are filled as quickly as possible if Belfast  International Airport,  and our other airports, are to achieve their obvious objective of being  regional airports for Northern    Ireland as well as serving the border  counties of the Republic?</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I agree with the Member. The potential for opening up  new markets for Belfast International Airport  was recognised particularly in relation to the work that was done along the new  stretch of the A1 between Belfast and Dublin. That is when the  impetus and argument around the need for directional signs at Sprucefield, to  the airport, became evident.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said in my initial answer, Roads Service has  responded. We are considering ways of amending and improving the signage. I  have had discussions with the management of Belfast International   Airport, and since the  commencement of Aer Lingus flights there, passenger numbers have increased and  business is continuing to grow. That is good news for the area.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  In light of the aforementioned tourism and commercial significance of our  airports and harbours &mdash; particularly those at Ballywalter, Portavogie and  Portaferry, to name but a few, in one beautiful constituency &mdash; does the  Minister take a uniform approach to the provision of signage in those  locations?</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The need for signage at Sprucefield was raised  because people thought that, given the road improvements and the increase in  traffic coming from the southern side towards Belfast International   Airport &mdash;<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span></p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Please allow the Minister to answer.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Given the increase in traffic coming from the  southern side towards Belfast   International Airport,  some people thought that additional signage was needed. If the Member has a  request for signage at any of the places that he mentioned, he can contact me  and I will be happy to do what I can.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: In  his answer to Mr Hamilton&rsquo;s initial question, the Minister referred to the A26.  Does he agree that if that important road, which is the main route from the  south to the north coast and the airport, gains extra traffic, the A26 dual  carriageway between Moira and Nutts Corner should be upgraded as soon as  possible.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: It would be nice to have the money to do all those  things. The recognition of the need for improved signage at Sprucefield arose  because of the significant increase in traffic and the potential for more  business for Belfast   International Airport.  The need for directions to Belfast   International Airport  was an issue, particularly for people coming from the southern side. That is  why the signage was improved.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">If the traffic increases to such an extent that it merits  another look at the road and its upgrading, the Department will look at that in  due course.</p>
	    <p class="H5StageHeading">A5 Derry/Londonderry to Aughnacloy</p>
	    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr  McCartney </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development for an update on the  A5 Derry/Londonderry to Aughnacloy road scheme.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO654/09>(AQO 654/09)</a></p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Since the Member&rsquo;s previous question for oral answer  in February 2008 in relation to the A5, Roads Service has carried out a series  of public information events and has progressed work to identify a preferred  corridor. I am pleased to advise the House that that work is nearing  completion, and an announcement on the preferred corridor is expected later  this year.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. The Minister will be aware that a  major road scheme between Derry and Dungiven  is under way, as well as the bypass. Both road schemes will have an impact on  traffic in Derry. What plans does the Minister  have to ease that impact?</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The Member is correct: there will be two major road  improvement schemes on the A5 and the A6 in the vicinity of Derry  in the coming years, and they will have an impact on traffic in the city. There  have been a significant number of developments in and around the city already:  the Skeoge Link, the opening of which I attended; the Crescent Link; the  Broadbridge scheme to provide dual carriageway at Clooney Road from Maydown to  the City of Derry Airport; and the two main roads that the Member mentioned. We  are also beginning a project to widen the Buncrana Road from Pennyburn roundabout  to the border, and that will assist in relieving traffic congestion.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Due to the impact of the two major routes coming in from Belfast and the  Aughnacloy side of the border, Roads Service has commissioned consultants to  consider linkages around the city and the impact that those two projects will  have. Reports on the preliminary work on that consultation should be available  before the end of the year.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bresland</strong>:  Many of my constituents have concerns about the possible route for the A5 dual  carriageway scheme. Will the Minister give an assurance that the landowners and  the wider community will be kept informed of the proposals for the A5  programme?</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I assure the Member that that will be the case. He  knows that there have been several public information events on the routes that  may be considered. Within the next couple of months &mdash; before the year is out &mdash;  I hope to announce the preferred corridor, which will contain several route  options. Again, that will go out to public consultation, and people who live  along that corridor will be given an opportunity to comment on it. It is a  substantial piece of road building, and the biggest that has ever been  undertaken on this island. It is going through mainly rural areas and will  affect a substantial number of landowners.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">A tried and tested procedure has been gone through for many  road schemes, including the A4 extension from Dungannon to Ballygawley, where a  substantial number of landowners had to be dealt with. I assure the Member that  there will be ongoing public consultation. Landowners affected directly will  have the opportunity to have their say and to ensure that their voices are  heard.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  When can people in Derry expect to see plans  to upgrade the Waterside railway station?</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The Member has managed to jump to question 19. As I  would have said had I got that far, there have been several upgrading works on  the station. Any further work will be considered in conjunction with the track  relay scheme between Coleraine and Derry due  to happen in 2011.</p>
	    <p class="H5StageHeading">Blasting Operations: A1</p>
	    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">6. <strong>Mr D  Bradley </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development what compensation is  available to (i) residents; and (ii) businesses, whose properties are damaged  as a result of blasting operations connected with the construction of the new  A1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO646/09>(AQO 646/09)</a></p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The removal of rock by blasting is an integral aspect  of the A1 Beech Hill to Cloghogue dual carriageway scheme. Although I regret  the disruption that construction activity is causing to adjacent properties,  blasting remains the only practical process, given the quantity and  characteristics of the rock involved. The contractor on site is required to  employ current good practice in relation to the construction process to ensure  that all necessary and appropriate measures are implemented to protect  properties in the vicinity of the work from damage.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Under the terms of the contract, the contractor will deal  with any claims that may arise in the event of damage caused to residential or  business properties by rock blasting.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  An dtig liom a fhiafra&iacute; den Aire c&aacute; mh&eacute;ad teach agus gn&oacute;lacht a ndearnadh  dochar d&oacute;ibh agus ar thug an tAire cuairt orthu? Caid&eacute; an meas&uacute;n&uacute; a rinne s&eacute;  orthu?</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">How many homes and businesses damaged by the blasting has  the Minister visited? Will he give Members an assessment of what he has  observed? Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I have not visited any properties. As far as I am  aware &mdash; and I have kept an eye on the situation &mdash; only one property has  reported any damage. The owners have been in touch with Roads Service and have  been informed of the procedure for pursuing compensation.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member is shaking his head. Perhaps he will correspond  with me and tell me about the other properties; however, I am aware of only  one. The owners have contacted Roads Service, and they have been advised who is  responsible for the site. The contractor is responsible, and he has informed  his insurance agents that there may be the possibility of a claim. That is the  process.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member is keen to try to put Roads Service or me in the  middle as having some responsibility. However, as the Member has been told on  several occasions, a contractor employed to carry out work is responsible for  what happens. Contractors are responsible for dealing with any damage or  inconvenience caused as a result of their actions. That is the way the contract  was designed, that is how it is being operated, and that is why the Department  has given the Member the same advice repeatedly.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Irwin</strong>: Is  the Minister aware of any precautions that had been adopted prior to blasting  operations to ensure the safety of livestock on neighbouring lands?</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I am not aware that any livestock have been  endangered. I am aware that the owners of one business property have claimed  that there was damage, and they have been instructed how to process any claim  that may arise. I know quite a number of people who live in that area, and I  talk to them regularly. I have not heard of any further claims of damage,  either to property or to livestock. However, if there are others, I am sure  that they will be able to pursue their claim in the same way.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Will the Minister undertake to investigate and resolve the access issue at  Newry&rsquo;s Altnaveigh Road,  which is just off the A1? That is causing serious concern among some of my  constituents, including Mr Nummy.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The Member was involved in discussions on the matter  during the summer, so he will know that a liaison group that comprises local  residents has been set up. The group covers Corrinshego and Altnaveigh, as well  as several other areas along the existing bypass and where the construction of  the new road is ongoing. That group has regular contact with Roads Service and,  more importantly, the contractors &mdash; they are the people who are closing roads  in order to carry out construction work. I am led to believe that a further meeting  about the Cloghogue area is to be held this week.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The liaison group, which also has local council  involvement, appears to be functioning quite well. Therefore, if the Member&rsquo;s  constituents are keen to pursue the issue, they can do so through that group,  which has acted on behalf of a number of residents and groups along the length  of the bypass. However, if they wish to pursue the matter in a different way, I  am happy to deal with any request that the Member brings to me.</p>
	    <p class="H5StageHeading">Portadown Railway Station</p>
	    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">7. <strong>Mr  Simpson </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development for an update on the  progress made in relation to the renovations at Portadown Railway Station.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO666/09>(AQO 666/09)</a></p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Translink is currently involved in the preliminary  stages of a project to refurbish Portadown station, and it expects the  feasibility study to be completed by the end of 2008. After that, several  further stages must be completed, including the production of an economic  appraisal to establish value for money and the obtaining of planning  permission. My Department will consider granting approval for that project when  all those procedures have been successfully completed, and if the necessary  funding can be secured.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Simpson</strong>:  The Minister will be aware that the people of Portadown have long awaited that project.  Craigavon Borough Council was given assurances that it would start in 2009.  Will the Minister use his influence to ensure that Translink meets that  deadline?</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: As I said, a number of processes must be completed  before the project can start. What I am about to say relates to the question  that Basil McCrea asked: the Department&rsquo;s intention is to give a commitment to  try to improve trains, journey times and facilities at various railway  stations, because it has been shown that, where facilities and public transport  improve, the number of passengers increases. The Department&rsquo;s intention is to  increase the numbers of people using public transport. I will undertake to  speak to Translink to ensure that no unnecessary delay takes place in pursuing  the scheme. I am not au fait with the discussions between Translink and  Craigavon Borough Council, so I do not know what assurances were sought or  given. However, I will certainly make it my business to ensure that there are no  unnecessary delays in delivering the project.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>:  What plans are under way to construct other new railway stations?</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The Member will be aware that Translink has been  given approval to proceed with a new &pound;14&middot;6 million railway station at Newry. It  is expected that that work will be completed in 2009. A scheme for a bus/rail  station in Antrim is also to be developed over the next few years.</p>
	    <p class="H5StageHeading">Rapid-Transit Proposals</p>
	    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">9. <strong>Mr  O&rsquo;Dowd </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development for an update on the  rapid-transit proposals.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO652/09>(AQO  652/09)</a></p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Good progress has been made since the take-note  debate in the House on the strategic outline case for rapid transit on Tuesday  3 June 2008. We have concluded the engagement with key stakeholders. As a  result of some concerns that were expressed, we further explored an alternative  route for rapid transit in east Belfast.  The results of that work have shown that it is not viable to use the Upper Newtownards Road  as part of the scheme. We are also establishing a dedicated delivery team for  rapid transit and are purchasing land for the scheme. In recognition of the  wider benefits of rapid transit, I have also written to my ministerial  colleagues, inviting their comments on my proposals.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I will allow the Member to ask a quick supplementary question.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Has the Minister carried out any assessment of the positive environmental  impact that a rapid-transit scheme would have in taking traffic off the roads  of Belfast?</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The purpose of rapid-transit schemes &mdash; indeed, of  investment in all public transport &mdash; is to reduce the number of cars on the  roads, thereby reducing the congestion and pollution that traffic causes. Of  course, investment in a rapid-transit system is expected to have a positive  impact on the environment, and it will certainly have a positive impact on the  development of the city of Belfast  itself.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  That ends questions to the Minister for Regional Development.</p>

	    <p class="H5StageHeading">Library Services: Rural Areas</p>
	    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr Weir </strong>asked  the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure what plans he has to engage with  local communities in relation to priorities for library services to rural  areas. <a name=AQO552/09>(AQO 552/09)</a></p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure (Mr Campbell)</strong>: In November 2005, my Department under&shy;took  an extensive consultation exercise that included the views of the rural  community. Those views were recognised and incorporated into the resulting  policy framework. The boards are responsible for delivering public library  services in line with public libraries policy, which includes engaging with  rural communities on local service priorities. Local engagement is ongoing  within the boards and will continue when the Northern Ireland library authority  is created.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The Carnegie Library redevelopment in Bangor is almost complete, and the building  should open to the public next month. The &pound;2&middot;7 million investment in the Ward  Park facility is one of a number of projects that will modernise and improve  the public library estate.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Next month&rsquo;s opening of the new Carnegie Library in Bangor will be a welcome development that  everyone will embrace. How will communities be consulted after the creation of  the Northern Ireland  library authority?</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: An appearance at Carnegie Hall will take on  another connotation in Bangor.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The Northern    Ireland library authority will become  operational in 2009 and will have local consultative groups. A pilot group will  be established in each of the four geographic business areas within the first  three months of the library authority&rsquo;s establishment. Library services must  continue to be relevant to local needs. Therefore, although the service will be  planned and led regionally, it will be delivered locally.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brolly</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Will the Minister detail the extent of  co-operation between Donegal County Council and the Western Education and  Library Board regarding mobile library services in that border area?</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: As I have outlined on previous occasions, the  provision of library services is a matter for the board. However, I appreciate  that mobile library services &mdash; particularly in the western area &mdash; have a  cross-border context, and there is a mobile library facility for that specific  purpose. Given the terrain and the rural nature of the land along the part of  the border to which the Member refers, it is sensible and productive for such  liaison to take place. The facility is, apparently, well used. I encourage  people &mdash; particularly those in Northern Ireland but also those in the Irish  Republic &mdash; to make use of that facility, and I hope that everyone will.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  Since 34% of the population live in rural areas, does the Minister agree that  his Department&rsquo;s raw expenditure on library provision needs to be rural  proofed? The rural population of 565,000 is served by only 30 mobile libraries  &mdash; that is approximately one library for every 20,000 people. Does the Minister  have any plans to increase that provision?</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Culture,  Arts and Leisure</strong>: That issue was raised during my last appearance at  Question Time; indeed, I think that that was as a result of a question from the  honourable Member. The provision of library services in rural areas is  primarily a matter for the education and library boards. My information is that  provision in rural areas is satisfactory and has been satisfactory over recent  years because no new demands for additional services &mdash; either from members of  the public or public representatives &mdash; have been made to the education and  library boards.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">If Members feel that there are areas that could be  adequately covered by existing services, or in which additional resources might  be deployed in order to provide that service, that information must be made  known &mdash; in the first instance, to the relevant education and library board. The  board and I will then consider that information.</p>
	    <p class="H5StageHeading">Inland Fish Stocks: Pollution</p>
	    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr B  McCrea </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure to detail the impact  of pollution incidences on inland fish stocks in the last year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO622/09>(AQO 622/09)</a></p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I am aware that several pollution incidents in  the past year have resulted in significant fish kills. Fisheries Conservancy  Board staff have investigated the incidents and estimated the numbers and types  of fish killed. DCAL will work closely with the Environment Agency and angling  clubs in order to provide advice and assistance about how to reinstate the  affected waters.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Pollution incidents have a broader impact on fisheries.  Pollution results in a loss of revenue from fishing and, sometimes, a reduction  in the population of species that are already under threat. A pollution  incident normally kills fish of varying ages. There is, therefore, a knock-on affect  for at least three to four years before fish populations recover to sustainable  levels.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer. Does he accept that there is a wider  impact on recreational tourism and its associated business areas? Will the Minister  instigate a review that will put a figure on the financial loss to the local  economy, and ensure that that loss is taken into account in a system of fines  that is based on the polluter pays principle?</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: The Member raises a valid and interesting point.  I repeat what has been previously stated: the Department of Culture, Arts and  Leisure is responsible for restocking rivers. The polluter pays principle is an  admirable one that most people believe in and advocate, but it is the  responsibility of the Department of the Environment (DOE). In the first  instance, my Department and the Environment Agency want to ensure that  pollution of rivers is prevented &mdash; an issue that is primarily dealt with by the  Department of the Environment.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">However, there is close liaison between my Department and  the DOE in order to ensure that pollution is prevented; that where pollution  occurs, those responsible pay for their actions; and, importantly, as I have  stated, that rivers are restocked. I subscribe to the principle of the polluter  paying that is contained in the Member&rsquo;s question.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: In  the wake of the Minister of the Environment&rsquo;s decision to extend the  slurry-spreading period until the end of the year, has the Minister of Culture,  Arts and Leisure been advised by his officials, or received correspondence from  the Environment Minister, about the possible pollution threat posed by that  extension?</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I have not received any communication from any  individuals or groups &mdash; including the Minister of the Environment &mdash; about the  potential pollution danger raised by the Member. I will draw his comments to  the attention of my Department and the Department of the Environment.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">However, if there were any serious potential for pollution,  Departments would have been alerted and the Minister of the Environment would  not have made that decision in the first instance.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>:  Will the Minister tell Members what discussions he has had with the Minister of  the Environment about the cleaning up and restocking of the Six Mile Water River  in Antrim after it suffered a recent, disastrous fish kill?</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: The Member has drawn attention to what was a  very serious incident. My officials are liaising with the Department of the  Environment in order to establish the full extent of the fish kill and to  prevent any repetition of such an event.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The situation is difficult and must be monitored closely. I  intend to continue liaising with the Department of the Environment,  concentrating on those two strategies: preventing a repeat incident and  ensuring that the river is adequately restocked with fish.</p>
	    <p class="H5StageHeading">Safety at Sports Grounds</p>
	    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mrs  Hanna </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure, given the public  concern that safety at sports grounds is being compromised, what long-term  plans he has to ensure public safety at these venues.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO675/09>(AQO 675/09)</a></p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: Responsibility for developing long-term plans to  ensure public safety at sports venues in Northern Ireland rests with the  owners and operators of those venues. However, the Department of Culture, Arts  and Leisure is taking forward a safety at sports grounds initiative, which aims  to assist owners and operators of major sports facilities to improve public  safety at their grounds in the longer term. As part of that process, the  Department is implementing new legislation on safety at sports grounds &mdash; the  Safety of Sports Grounds (Northern    Ireland) Order 2006. In addition, Sport  Northern Ireland, which is responsible for the development of sport, including  the distribution of funding, has been running funding programmes designed to  assist owners and operators to improve public safety at their venues. The  programmes include a stadia safety programme and a previous interim safe sports  grounds scheme.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>:  Will that include an audit of safety and resource requirements, and will it  involve the closure of any grounds?</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I will answer the last part of the Member&rsquo;s  question first. I do not envisage any venue closing as the result of an audit.  Funding is being considered for some grounds through the programmes that I have  outlined. The names of those grounds can be supplied to the Member, but I am  reluctant to mention them, as that would open Pandora&rsquo;s box. However, operators  of all sporting grounds should be aware of the grant-aided schemes that are  available. If they are not aware of them, they should become aware of them and  make applications, because it is essential that everyone using a sports ground  in Northern Ireland, for whatever legitimate purpose, should be able to do so  in the knowledge that they will be safe as they go there and safe as they  return from it. That is the aim of the scheme, and, hopefully, it will be fully  operational shortly.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I am taken by the emphatic nature of the Minister&rsquo;s answers. Will he comment on  a &lsquo;BBC Newsline&rsquo; report on 20 August 2008, which referred to a letter written  by the chief executive of Sport Northern Ireland to the Department in September  2007, in which he wrote about the many unsafe sports venues and about the  safety of spectators being compromised?</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I am aware of the report to which the honourable  Member refers. There were some inaccuracies in it. For example, there was  reference to Great Britain&rsquo;s  Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 being rushed through &mdash; but the legislation  was actually enacted four years after the disaster that pre-empted it.  Therefore, it was not rushed through.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department was already aware of a number of matters  contained in the report. Northern    Ireland, through Sport Northern Ireland,  will have an overseeing body that will be very similar to the Football  Licensing Authority in GB. The Department is in the process of ensuring that it  will be in a position to guarantee that &mdash; even though some concerns in the  programme were inaccurate &mdash; the underlying concern is for the safety of the  public using stadia in Northern    Ireland. That is a very real and present  concern.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">However, it is a concern that Sport NI and all of us should  be acutely aware of. We must take steps to address those problems.</p>
	    <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a thabhairt  don Aire as a fhreagra.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I asked the previous Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure  about the legislation in March 2008. He said that Sport NI wished to delay the  legislation because it wanted the inclusion of an independent oversight  function that it would carry out. Will the Minister explain why, now that we  are in October, that still has not been established? Is the delay related to  the crowd capacity problems that would ensue at Windsor Park  if the legislation were to be enacted?</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: Whatever about issues of delay in the past, I  know that agreement has already been reached with Sport NI on the issue of the  oversight body. That body will provide advice and guidance to all interested  parties on safety matters, and will monitor the implementation of a planned new  sports grounds safety-certification scheme. Sport NI recently completed the  recruitment exercise for the oversight body. I cannot comment on what may have  happened in the past, but the facts are that the body is now in place,  recruitment has been completed, and the body will be up and running shortly.</p>
	    <p class="H5StageHeading">Multi-Sports Stadium: Maze Site</p>
	    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr Ford </strong>asked  the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure what discussions he has had with  Executive colleagues in relation to the proposed multi-sports stadium at the  Maze site.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO613/09>(AQO 613/09)</a></p>
	    <p class="H5StageHeading">Multi-Sports Stadium: Business Plan</p>
	    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">9. <strong>Mr Lunn </strong>asked  the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure what discussions he has had with the  Minister of Finance and Personnel in relation to the business plan for the  proposed multi-sports stadium.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO615/09>(AQO 615/09)</a></p>
	    <p class="H5StageHeading">Multi-Sports Stadium: Time Frame</p>
	    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">14. <strong>Mrs D  Kelly: </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure to detail the normal  time frame for building major sports stadia; and if he is satisfied that the  proposed multi-sports stadium will be built in time for the London Olympics.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO677/09>(AQO 677/09)</a></p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: With your permission, Mr Speaker, I will answer  questions 4, 9 and 14 together.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The outline business case for the proposed multi-sports  stadium, together with a corresponding business case for the Maze project, for  which OFMDFM is responsible, have been closely examined by the Department of  Finance and Personnel. The current First Minister, in his former role as  Minister of Finance and Personnel, provided advice to ministerial colleagues on  his assessment of the stadium and the overall Maze project.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The issue of the multi-sports stadium, together with the  overall regeneration of the Maze site, has still to be considered by the  Executive. That is a further reason why it is important for the Executive to  meet as soon as possible. The opportunity for Northern Ireland to host soccer  matches as part of the 2012 Olympics is clearly contingent on the availability  of a fit-for-purpose stadium, although that would not necessarily require the  building of a multi-sports stadium.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his response. He may not have heard the First Minister  earlier when he set out the options for the future, which were: a single  stadium at the Maze, a single stadium elsewhere, or upgrades to existing  stadiums. The First Minister ruled out the do-nothing option. Will the Minister  now rule out the idea of upgrading three elderly stadiums in order to provide  three expensive elderly stadiums, and give a firm commitment to a single  stadium for all sports, as a sign of a shared future?</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I was not present when the First Minister spoke  earlier, but it is self-evident that those are the options. As we stand, in  October 2008, I am in a position to go to the Executive with a paper in order  to clear up the uncertainty that has surrounded the issue. For that reason, I  want an Executive meeting to take place as early as this Thursday. None of that  takes me beyond where I want to go for the moment. The honourable Member  invites me to declare what the new and ongoing position would be, but he would  be the first to concede that I should do it according to the established  protocols of the Assembly.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I am doing what I should be doing: consulting my Executive  colleagues, then consulting the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure, and  then come before the House &mdash; in that order. When I entered office in June, I said  that I wanted to reveal when the uncertainty would end and to make progress in  the autumn. We are well into autumn. If the Executive does not meet, I will  have to examine other ways of taking the situation forward, but we have clear  protocols by which I want to abide.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: I  am one of those who still hope to see a national stadium at the Maze. Does the  Minister agree that the problems in agreeing a way forward on the Maze project  are not entirely financial; nor are they solely related to the business plan or  even to the recent impasse over Executive meetings? The problems stem from the  original disagreement concerning the inability of the Minister&rsquo;s party, and  presumably the Minister himself, to accept the concept of a  conflict-transformation centre on the Maze site.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I hope that the Member heard my initial response  about the business case for the Maze project, which was closely examined by the  Department of Finance and Personnel and by the former First Minister. The  Member mentioned the conflict-transformation initiative, but the issue remains  &mdash; whether there was to be a conflict-transformation initiative or not &mdash; that  there are serious questions about the funding of the Maze project. That does  not mean that it is inconceivable that the Maze project will proceed; however,  three Departments expressed concerns about the business case. There is no  disagreement in my party about the way forward, because I have yet to bring the  proposal through the Executive, to the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure  and to the Assembly. When that happens, the honourable Member and others will  see the unity on the outcome of those discussions.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer, but the OFMDFM Committee &mdash; which I  understand has overall responsibility for the development of the Maze/Long Kesh  site &mdash; was told some months ago that in order for any development to be on-site  in time for the London Olympics the application should have been lodged by  November of last year. We heard the First Minister sharing his concerns about  construction jobs, and we have also been told that 10,000 jobs are at stake. Is  it the case that whenever a decision is made on the Maze/Long Kesh project, the  DUP will change the Minister or will this Minister actually make a decision?</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: The honourable Member issues a challenge on  taking a decision. I said, within weeks of taking office, that the decision had  to be taken in the autumn. It is now autumn and I am ready to take the  decision, but I need an Executive meeting. I hope that the honourable Member  follows the logic of the argument. If an Executive meeting is held on Thursday,  I am ready to put a paper to the Executive this Thursday to proceed. The Member  referred to the challenge of the 2012 Olympic Games. That will be a challenge,  but it is not at all beyond the bounds of possibility that if we take a  decision now &mdash; which I am ready to do &mdash; we will have a stadium for 2012. We  will have a stadium if we take that decision now &mdash; which, as I say, I am ready,  prepared, and able to do &mdash; but I need an Executive meeting to process the issue  and to set in motion the choreography that I have outlined. We need the  meeting, and, I hope, we will have it.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his response. It seems that those asking questions  have failed to understand the importance of the views of sports&rsquo; governing  bodies. Have those bodies been made aware of the alternatives to a multi-sports  stadium at the Maze? If so, what was their response?</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: My discussions with the three sporting bodies  involved in the Maze project were straightforward. I told each body that I knew  its previous position and asked whether that position remained the same. I then  asked the three bodies what their preferred second option would be. As a result  of those discussions, and others that I have had, I am in a position to furnish  my Executive colleagues with a paper that should end the uncertainty. I can  then begin significant and substantial progress towards ensuring that the  requirements of all three sports are met. That is my aim and objective, which  will &mdash; hopefully &mdash; be achieved sooner rather than later.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert  Coulter</strong>: The Minister has partly answered my question and answered the  critics, but I will read my question anyway. Is the Minister&rsquo;s prevarication  and failure to make an announcement on the Maze project directly due to  political pressure from Sinn F&eacute;in as part of ongoing negotiations between that  party and his? Does he agree that part of the finance allocation for the Maze  project should immediately be redirected to upgrade existing sports facilities  and events, such as the North West  200 and the Ulster Grand Prix?</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I understand the honourable Member&rsquo;s  frustration, which is shared by many people. However, I reiterate that I took  office in June and, within three weeks, said that I wanted to meet all the  governing bodies of the sports involved in the Maze project, which I did before  the summer. I then said that I wanted to make a decision in the autumn; it is  now the autumn, and I am ready to make that decision. As per the rules that we  operate under, I must bring a paper on the issue to an Executive meeting before  I make a decision, which I am ready to do on Thursday. If that happens, we are  immediately in business. I hope that the Executive meeting is held on Thursday,  and we will be in business immediately thereafter.</p>
	    <p class="H5StageHeading">Language Strategy</p>
	    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Dr Farry </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure to report on his plans for  a language strategy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO618/09> (AQO  618/09)</a></p>
	    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">11. <strong>Mr  O&rsquo;Loan </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure to provide an update  on the development of the indigenous languages strategy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO671/09>(AQO 671/09)</a></p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: With your permission, Mr Speaker, I will answer  questions 5 and 11 together. The interdepartmental charter implementation group  has begun consideration of a strategy for indigenous minority languages. That  strategy aims to protect, enhance and develop the Ulster-Scots language,  heritage and culture and the Irish language. I will present an initial paper to  the Executive Committee on that later this year.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Does the Minister see a role for himself in depoliticising the controversy that  surrounds the Irish language? Also, does he see any merit in a potential  compromise based on the language-scheme approach that his Department consulted  on prior to the restoration of devolution, which reflects the reality on the  ground from the bottom up, rather than imposing something from the top down?</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I do not disagree with the general thrust of the  Member&rsquo;s comments. Depoliticising the Irish language is an excellent idea,  which should have been thought of many years ago. There are many Irish-language  enthusiasts who do not politicise the language, but those who do should cease  forthwith. Hopefully, we can advance a proposal for languages per se within a  non-political framework and in a non-contentious manner.</p>

	    <p class="H4StageHeading">Neighbourhood Renewal Projects in Belfast</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received a private notice question, in accordance with Standing Order  20, for the Minister for Social Development.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n asked the Minister for Social Development  (i) whether the recent review that she instructed departmental officials to  conduct into neighbourhood renewal projects in the Belfast  area will result in services and jobs being lost in this geographical area and  (ii) whether those projects that are waiting on overdue payments from Belfast regeneration  offices will be paid immediately.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development (Ms Ritchie)</strong>: First, let me be clear that I have not  ordered any review. Those who suggest that I have ordered a review are only  creating unnecessary anxieties.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I will, however, answer the questions raised. I asked for  some financial information about the current neighbourhood renewal process in Belfast. I want to  satisfy myself that best use is being made of available resources, and, given  the pressure on funds across my Department, to make sure that sufficient funds  are in place in order to complete the programme.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I will be spending some &pound;30 million on neighbourhood  renewal in Belfast  over the next three years. It is only right that before the first major tranche  of contracts are issued, I satisfy myself that the resources are in place in  order to complete the process, and that resources are sufficient for purpose  and properly targeted in line with the appraisal processes that officials are  required to follow.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Neighbourhood renewal is about closing the gap between the  most disadvantaged in Northern    Ireland and the rest of our society. I want  to see important services delivered to people on the ground, whether by statutory  agencies or by voluntary and community organisations. The role of my  Department&rsquo;s neighbourhood renewal investment fund is to ensure that such  services are delivered, not to sustain jobs in voluntary and community-sector  organisations.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that when the process is completed, we will have a  stronger focus on services. I have said on the record that individual  appraisals and approvals of local neighbourhood renewal projects will be  conducted by officials. I will not get involved in those decisions, and I  expect that the majority of existing posts will continue to be funded. However,  I can give no guarantees.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Payments under contracts for funding will not fall due  until those contracts have been approved, issued and signed. I am bound by  Government accounting rules, commonly known as managing public money, which  prohibit advance payments. I can assure the Member that, when contracts for  funding are in force, payments will be made in a timely manner.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I expect to be able to make an announcement in the next few  days about the clearance of contracts. I wish to remind Members that  neighbourhood renewal is the Executive&rsquo;s main programme for tackling  disadvantage. There is an onus on other Departments to match the commitment  and, perhaps more importantly, the resources of the Department for Social  Development with regard to projects.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. If it walks like a review and  looks like a review, it is a review. Forbye all that, the Minister did not  answer the question about jobs and services being lost with regard to the  outcome of this review. For example, in the Crumlin and Ardoyne wards in north Belfast, the  neighbourhood renewal partnership has been suspended and workers are in receipt  of redundancy and protective notices. As a result of the Minister&rsquo;s political  interference and, indeed, political vetting of that project &mdash;<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span></p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Speaker: Order.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n: All the economic appraisals for each of  the partnerships have been conducted, and the panels recommended that most of  those projects be funded. What, therefore, is the reason for the delay? These  services, which are for the most deprived areas in the North of Ireland, are  now at risk.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister for Social Development: I am deeply  disappointed at the comments made by the Member. I emphasise, yet again, that I  have not ordered any review, and those who have suggested that I have ordered a  review are the ones who are creating anxieties and uncertainty on the ground.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I again emphasise that I have asked for financial  information about the current neighbourhood renewal process in Belfast.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to be satisfied that the best use is being made of  available resources and also, given the pressure on departmental funds, to  ensure that they are sufficient to complete the programme. Furthermore, I  understand the difficulties of groups whose money has run out. I hope to have  some good news for them in the future.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Attwood: I urge you, Mr Speaker, to reflect upon the  comments of the Member for North Belfast, who  said that there has been political interference and vetting. I ask you to rule  on those comments at another time. If true, they would be a breach of the Minister&rsquo;s  Pledge of Office, her commitment to political impartiality and, even more  fundamentally, of her proven input &mdash;</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I ask the Member to put his question.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I have raised a matter about the comments of the Member for North   Belfast, who has strayed beyond political convention in the  Chamber and has made serious allegations of political interference and vetting.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. I insist that the Member put his supplementary question to the Minister.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I look forward to your ruling on that matter, Mr Speaker.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the Minister whether she agrees that, given that she  has demonstrated an unambiguous commitment to people who are in social and  housing need, it is a bit rich for certain people to come to the Chamber and  make ridiculous allegations that she has created undue anxiety in the  community.<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span></p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Will you call to order those who interrupt me, Mr Speaker?</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. I remind the Member that I have given him considerable latitude on the  issue. He must ask the Minister a supplementary question. I have already  prompted him twice. Let us try to get to the supplementary question.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I am mindful of what you said, Mr Speaker.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Given that the Minister has stated in the Chamber today  that the responsibility for neighbourhood renewal does not fall exclusively to  her Department and that it is a shared responsibility across Government and the  Departments of other Ministers, I ask her simply to tell Members what  commitments have come from her ministerial colleagues, including those from the  party from which the question emanates.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. Members may find  some background information helpful.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">As one who is deeply interested in social disadvantage &mdash; who  puts need and the delivery of services to meet that need at the centre of  everything that I do &mdash; I want to emphasise the point that there is a budget for  neighbourhood renewal that will be spent in neighbourhood-renewal areas. The  &pound;30 million that has been allocated for Belfast&rsquo;s  neighbourhood-renewal areas during the next three years will be spent in those  areas. Therefore, people who live in disadvantaged, neighbourhood-renewal areas  need not worry on that score.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">As regards my colleague&rsquo;s question about the Executive&rsquo;s  and ministerial colleagues&rsquo; commitment, I remind Members that neighbourhood  renewal is the Executive&rsquo;s main programme for tackling disadvantage. There is  an onus on other Departments to match the commitment and, perhaps, more  important, the resources of the Department for Social Development (DSD) towards  projects.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I understand that the Member for North Belfast Ms N&iacute;  Chuil&iacute;n has asked various Ministers about their commitment to neighbourhood  renewal. I will provide the House with some detail. The Minister of <strong>Agriculture and Rural Development said that  her Department</strong>:</p>
	    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;has no direct involvement in the Programme, and would  have no remit to fund posts and services in connection with it&rdquo;,</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">even though her Department has a representative on  the partnership body. The First Minister and the <strong>deputy First Minister said</strong>:</p>
	    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;OFMDFM as a Department has a role to play across a  number of activities which form part of the overall Neighbourhood Renewal  network but does not directly fund Neighbourhood Renewal posts and services.&rdquo;</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">OFMDFM is also represented on the Minister-led partnership  body. Therefore, Mr Speaker, I must ask what other Departments&rsquo; commitment and  buy-in are when neighbourhood renewal is an Executive-led initiative.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">All Members of the Assembly &mdash; and of the Executive, were it  allowed to meet &mdash; should ask those questions, try to tackle that issue and  demonstrate real care and commitment on the ground, particularly in  disadvantaged areas, instead of engaging in petty political point-scoring and  trying to undermine certain individuals.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: I  recognise the Minister&rsquo;s point that this is a significant amount of funding and  that processes have to be followed.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I have corresponded with the Minister concerning an issue  that arose in my constituency. I understand her point that the funding is not  intended to provide jobs for people. However, last week, half the staff engaged  on that project went without salaries; this week, all the staff will do so. If  interim arrangements are not put in place, is there not a risk that, by the  time final decisions are taken, delivery of service will have been negatively  impacted upon by the loss of qualified and experienced staff?</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank Mrs Long for her question. Unlike others, she  has written to me directly about this matter. I understand the difficulties  faced by the group whose money has run out, and I hope to have some good news  for it later in the week. However, I am bound by Government accounting rules in  relation to gap funding and &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Speaker: Order. The Minister has the Floor.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Therefore, I want to pursue all the issues relating to  that matter.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I emphasise to the House that for me, need takes priority.  That is the most important thing. I want services delivered where there is  need.</p>

	    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Debate resumed on motion:</p>
	    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes the waiting time for POCVA checks to  be processed; further notes that this is adversely affecting child care  centres, amongst other employers; and asks the Secretary of State to  investigate the situation and ensure that applications are processed as a  matter of urgency.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="Italic">[Mr J  Shannon] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Mr S Hamilton] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Mr G Robinson]</span></p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mrs I Robinson: I take the opportunity to congratulate  my party colleagues for securing the debate, which is timely and very important  to communities outside this great Building.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">As legislation stands, the comprehensive vetting system  plays a central role in the recruitment procedures of all sorts of  organisations and groups. Failure to adhere to the legislation will have grave  repercussions: ignoring it is therefore not an option. It is crucial that the  vetting system is operated as effectively and efficiently as possible. The  inevitable result of inefficiency is that applications are delayed and,  subsequently, organisations seeking employees, and individuals seeking employment,  are left in limbo. That is what happened in Northern   Ireland during the summer months, and it prompted a wave  of complaints to be lodged directly with Access Northern Ireland and  with constituency offices across the Province.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Although Access Northern Ireland has met its obligations in  relation to basic and standard checks, the enhanced disclosure scheme has  collapsed. Initial assurances were that the process would take no longer than  eight weeks; however, that period has spiralled to over 13 weeks, causing  absolute havoc for all those involved.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I was contacted by several nursing homes, each of which  expressed considerable frustration in relation to the lack of progress of  applications for vacancies that they desperately needed to fill. That put the  nursing homes in an incredibly difficult position as they struggled to ensure  sufficient cover. In one instance, the process took so long that the successful  applicant had to decline the offer and seek employment elsewhere. That has  happened time and again across the constituencies. In another instance, one of  my constituents, who had spent years studying at university, had graduated with  a Postgraduate Certificate in Education this summer and who was desperately seeking  work, had to turn down at least five offers of employment. Owing to the  backlog, her application lay for over a month before it was even considered,  and she has yet to receive clearance.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">A local community association also contacted me. It  provides an after-school club, a school-holiday club, youth clubs and senior  citizens&rsquo; lunch clubs, and employs qualified staff as well as volunteers. The  association interviewed people and offered a vacant play-worker position to an  applicant in April, expecting that clearance would have been secured before the  commencement of the holiday club. However, clearance was not received until the  end of August.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">All the situations that I have described are the results of  delays that have been experienced at Access Northern Ireland. Responsibility for that  lies solely at the doors of the Department of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety and the Northern Ireland Office.</p>
	    <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Although it is crucial that we do as much as possible to  protect the most vulnerable in our society, legislation on the matter is now so  profuse that many community and voluntary sectors are reviewing their  willingness to provide services, and others who may have an interest are  recoiling due to the amount of bureaucracy that is involved. That situation  must be resolved as soon as possible. We are facing a meltdown in nursing homes  and in areas that deal with the most vulnerable in our society, that is, young  children. If we cannot give that group the necessary protection, we are in a  great mess. I ask the Secretary of State and the Department of Health to do all  that they can to ensure that there are no more delays in resolving the issue.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I also thank Mr Shannon and his colleagues for tabling the motion at this time,  given the stage that we have reached with the issue. It is a hugely concerning  matter. I have recorded delays of up to 20 weeks in getting an enhanced check  through the process. That is clearly unacceptable. Not all the checks take 20  weeks, but delays exist. The provision of domiciliary care, nursing and  residential care in nursing homes, hospital trusts, education boards, nurseries  and playgroups, as well as in early-years provision, are being thrown into near  chaos as a result of the delays.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">It worries me more that when the undertaking was given that  90% of enhanced checks would be completed within four weeks, some of the  service providers warned that that would not be possible with existing  resources and procedures. Nothing was done to rectify the situation at that  time, and that has created a huge gap in provision. I believe that the  provision that was given when that undertaking was made was hugely misguided.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">However, there is an opportunity to move the process on.  Suggestions have been made that the situation will be resolved and that the  four-week deadline will be reinstated by the end of the year. I hope that that  is true, but given past history, I have grave doubts as to whether that will  happen.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I understand that there was a temporary relaxation of the  regulations sometime between 4 June and 25 July 2008. I am told that a further  relaxation of those regulations came into effect from 21 August. I would like  clarification at some stage as to whether that is accurate and as to whether  those relaxations have occurred since 21 August. The relaxations should allow  providers to get an indication of suitability from Access Northern Ireland from  the initial checks that they perform. That organisation is provided with a list  of unacceptable people. Service providers should be given the chance to see  that list at the earliest opportunity so that they can decide whether they want  to progress with the temporary employment of someone who applies for a job and  who is not on the list and then put them under strict supervision. That would at  least allow the issue to progress.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Another difficulty is that once a check has been completed,  that person cannot carry that authority with them if they move jobs within a  short timescale &mdash; they must go through the entire process again.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">In one instance, one of my constituents made an application  through AccessNI, but the job was filled in the meantime. The person got  adequate provision from AccessNI and, within five days, was offered another  job; but that individual was not allowed to take up that job, simply because  the original check could not be transferred to a new employer. That really must  be resolved; some sort of follow-up process should allow a check to be carried  on to a new employer. Those issues could be helped and improved within a very  short timescale.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">We need to see an improvement in the service. The Minister  has indicated that more staff have been put in place and have been asked to  work longer hours to try to resolve the backlog. There must be clear answers;  will the problem be resolved in the short term, before Christmas? If it is not  resolved, providers will not be able to forward plan. If an employee at a local  playgroup or nursing home gives a weeks notice, that vacancy cannot be filled.  That is the difficulty, and I want it to be resolved as soon as possible.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  The protection of children and vulnerable adults is, and should always be, of  paramount importance to all Departments that have responsibility for delivering  services of any type to the people of Northern Ireland. Currently, the  caring services appear to be hit the hardest by the backlog and tardy  processing and by what that means for recruitment and the roll-out of care. It  is vital that the vetting procedures and security checks are carried out in a  timely fashion.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">In recent months, my constituency office has received many  complaints from individuals who have made applications for posts and are  awaiting clearance by Access Northern Ireland. In one case, a  mental-health nurse&rsquo;s application took 28 weeks for clearance. That is totally  unacceptable. Last month, we received several complaints from separate  organisations that are awaiting clearance on various appointments and are  desperately in need of additional staff. None of us would condone the  appointment of workers without the appropriate checks having been carried out.  However, a better screening system is vital.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Minister Goggins told us publicly that he acknowledges that  there is a problem and that staff are working longer hours and more staff are  being employed to clear the backlog. Despite all those additional hours, it is  not clear that the problem has been overcome. Is the very process at fault? At  this stage, we must consider that, as more and more requests for clearance come  through AccessNI, the backlog will continue, and staff deployed to deal with  the initial problem will probably be resited or will return to their previous  posts. The problem will linger until there is another round of complaints and &mdash;  as with many of the motions that we debate &mdash; we find ourselves in the same  position, in another few months, demanding change and urgent better practice.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">In today&rsquo;s employment and financial climate, there is  desperation in the air as the credit crunch really gets its teeth stuck in.  Even in a stable economy, employment in Northern Ireland has always been  scarce, to say the least. However, in the midst of the current crisis,  employment is more important than ever before. For families, employment means a  salary, which could be the difference between living on the breadline or not.  Given that scenario, the vetting process must be efficient, effective and  responsive.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">None of us wishes to criticise a process that was put in place  to ensure the protection of children and vulnerable people. However, when that  very process is backfiring on those whom it is supposed to protect, we are left  with no option but to use whatever vehicle we can to improve the delivery of  that process.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">A full and frank investigation into vetting procedures and  the causes for such lengthy delays must be implemented sooner rather than  later, if we are to have even the slightest chance of providing an efficient  service with a response time that will benefit the client and the applicant. In  short, it is down to time, which, as the saying goes, is of the essence. Better  safe than sorry should be the order of the day when dealing with the protection  of children and vulnerable adults. However, if the situation is not put right  immediately, each day hundreds, if not thousands, of children and vulnerable adults  will be put at risk by the very process that is there to assist and protect  them and their care.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The Security Minister must now act to put an end to a  situation that has all the symptoms of meltdown.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I could mention several cases and describe to Members how  the vetting process is being applied. The people concerned must wait and wait  while organisations need them to do the jobs to which they have been appointed;  and the people for whom they have been appointed to care are being sold short.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Schools are in the same position. I know of one school that  is waiting for 11 clearances and has received none. The school term began at  start of September, but those cases have still not been cleared. A moment ago,  someone in the Chamber handed me a note informing me that it took two hours to  get a phone call through to Access Northern Ireland. What chance does that give  people who need to contact the organisation? Public representatives do not even  have a hotline to Access Northern Ireland &mdash; perhaps they should,  because that may help slightly. It is totally unacceptable that it takes two  hours to get through to an organisation of that nature.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  congratulate the Members who tabled the motion on an issue that affects  thousands of people across the country. To place in context how many people are  affected, some 12 million people in the United   Kingdom are employed in jobs that require them to undergo  a security check, and more than 6,000 applications are being processed in Northern Ireland  alone. The safety of children and vulnerable adults is regarded, rightly, as an  important issue, and the Assembly must take it seriously.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The Protection of Children and Vulnerable Adults (Northern  Ireland) Order 2003 aims to improve safeguards for vulnerable sections of  society and is, on the face of it, extremely welcome. It is important that  groups and organisations that work with children and vulnerable adults can be  confident that their employees are not a threat to the well-being of those in  their care. The Order also gives added peace of mind to family members who  place their loved ones in the care of others.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">However, the fact that a huge backlog of cases threatens  people&rsquo;s jobs and childcare, health and education facilities is not welcome. As  Mrs Naomi Long said, the threat extends even beyond that to leaders of  voluntary groups. At present, the delays are as long as two months, which is  frustrating for those people who are being prevented from going to work, and  that was not the timescale that was envisaged when the process was established.  It was stated at that time that Access Northern Ireland would process the  majority of applications within only a few weeks. I know of cases in my  constituency of applications not even being on the system by then.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to mention one particular case with which I have  been dealing in my constituency &mdash; with, I must say, little success. I was  contacted by a lady who had been working at the PlayAway Nursery in Island  Magee. That is a fairly small nursery that employs only three members of staff.  The lady had been working there for some time, but she is still waiting for her  vetting clearance to come through. She was told that she cannot go back to work  there until the vetting forms have been returned. The nursery simply cannot  survive with two members of staff, and my constituent is understandably  irritated that she cannot continue in the job that she loves because of delays  and red tape.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Mrs Dowey is not alone in her frustration. If the delay causes  the nursery to close, the parents must look elsewhere for childcare. When I  asked Access Northern Ireland  whether it could fast-track the application, I was told that that was not  possible. The organisation said that it had not even begun to process the  application because it was still working through others that it had received  several months earlier. Thankfully, Access Northern Ireland finally agreed to  prioritise the application and process it manually, but it still took some time  and remains unresolved.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">It is not only the PlayAway Nursery that suffers from being  placed in that impossible position. Members have heard today of many nursing  homes and childcare facilities across Northern Ireland that are in a  similar position. As groups experience difficulty in hiring staff, the delays  put children and vulnerable adults at risk, because those who are keen to work  are left at home, awaiting clearance or, as is more often the case, walk away  from the job to do something else. As previously mentioned, most people cannot  afford to wait for clearance or rely on their wages to survive, particularly  now that current global economic conditions are severely stretching household  finances.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">My constituent Mrs Dowey loved the work that she was doing  and is willing to wait for clearance, but the vast majority of people simply  cannot afford to take that option. It is paramount that changes be made to the  system to make it more efficient and speedy, so that groups and childcare  facilities are not put under pressure to find accredited staff, and so that  ever more people are not forced to walk away from jobs that they enjoy. I  support the motion.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  also support the motion, and I declare an interest as a volunteer officer in  the Boys&rsquo; Brigade. I, in common with others in the Chamber, am subject to vetting  checks. Potentially, people in voluntary services will not be able to provide  support to their communities or facilitate the progress and learning of  children.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, I am a member of Horizon Sure Start, which  employs people in the children&rsquo;s sector. That organisation may experience  delays. My son, who is seeking part-time employment, has experienced  difficulties with the legislation, whereby the employer told him that he could  not start employment until the completion of the process. That process has  taken several months.</p>
	    <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Lessons must be learnt from the Soham inquiry, and  legislation must be produced and delivered. At the minute, delivery is failing.  The legislation is correct in theory, but systems must be established, and the  resources must be available to ensure delivery. As other Members said, a wide  range of services is affected, including critical areas such as children&rsquo;s  services, nursing homes, residential homes, the teaching profession and the PSNI.  The Northern Ireland Office and AccessNI are endangering children and  vulnerable people. As a result of the delays, there is a risk of understaffing  and failing to help children and vulnerable adults. That is an indictment of  the Northern Ireland Office and AccessNI, and the situation must be rectified  immediately.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Elliott: Is the Member aware that, in some cases,  service providers have received personal details of someone other than the  individual who applied for the job?</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Beggs: I am aware of that; it is a serious breach of  data protection legislation and an indictment of the administration that is  handling that sensitive personal information.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Successful applicants who cannot start employment will seek  other jobs. That adds huge costs to the system such as re-advertising costs for  employers and costs of submitting additional checks. That bungs up the system,  and AccessNI may receive more applications for every full-time job than is  necessary. Removal of that bottleneck is essential.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">One of my constituents is experiencing difficulties  receiving clearance to become a part-time taxi driver. After six months, his  application has still not proceeded. That individual has a clean record and is  a respected member of the local community. That is an important employment  issue and, moreover, affects our towns and city centres in the evenings,  particularly on Friday and Saturday nights. AccessNI is not allowing young  people to travel home safely and quickly, and avoid potential difficulties on  the streets.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">We must introduce new legislation to improve the safety of  children and vulnerable adults. Where are the systems, resources and staff to  deliver those improvements? The Northern Ireland Office must fix the situation.  I concur with my colleague Tom Elliott, who outlined that the system must be  altered &mdash; even temporarily. Individuals have received approval and, five days  later, are told that they must return to the bottom of the pile and wait  several months before they consider a similar job in a similar location. That  is ridiculous; it is bureaucracy gone mad, and changes are essential. A rolling  extension to those procedures &mdash; whereby an increasing number of areas will be  scrutinised &mdash; is in operation. It is essential that the scheduling is carefully  examined in order to ensure delivery and to ensure that our children and  vulnerable adults do not experience further difficulties.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  I support the motion and thank my colleagues for highlighting such an important  and timely matter.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The vetting of those who work or volunteer with children or  vulnerable adults is one part of our system that is in place to stop unsuitable  people getting access to those who are at risk. Members will know that  emergency legislation was introduced earlier this year that temporarily relaxed  current vetting procedures pending receipt of an enhanced-disclosure  certificate, but such legislation was absolutely essential to enable key  establishments to recruit adequate staff.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">We are all aware of the graphic results when a protective system  fails, and we recall the terrible events in Soham and the activities of Ian  Huntley. More locally, the inquiry of 1993 that produced the &lsquo;An Abuse of  Trust&rsquo; report examined the activities of sex offender Martin Huston, who  managed to abuse children in a number of organisations, despite some  professionals being aware of the risk that he posed and his past offences,  combined with a then lax and underdeveloped system of pre-employment vetting.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">With the enactment of the Protection of Children and  Vulnerable Adults (Northern    Ireland) Order 2003, arrangements were  strengthened, and further built on the provision of the pre-employment  consultancy service that was run by the Department of Health, Social Services  and Public Safety. The 2003 legislation significantly improved vetting  requirements and created a statutory disqualification list, and made vetting  and reporting those who had harmed children a requirement for a range of posts  in childcare organisations.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">For others, mainly in the community and voluntary sector,  uniformed and sporting organisations, the vetting of those who sought posts was  facilitated by the legislation, encouraged by the Department of Health and  Social Services and was widely prescribed as good practice. Running parallel to  Protection of Children and Vulnerable Adults (Northern   Ireland) Order 2003 was the issue of Part V of the Police  Act 1997, which was enacted in all other parts of the UK with the exception of Northern Ireland,  despite the fact that Parliament intended the legislation to apply here.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The NIO eventually implemented Part V of the Police Act  1997 this year &mdash; 11 years later. That also facilitated the establishment of  AccessNI to process vetting checks, which took over that responsibility from  the Department of Education and the Department of Health. Part V of the Police  Act 1997 also created a more robust statutory process for the police to provide  disclosure information, particularly in enhanced disclosures when relevant,  non-conviction data can be provided.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">A lot of work has gone in to encouraging organisations to  carry out vetting checks and to operate the new processes and arrangements.  However, it is regrettable to witness the considerable delays that have  developed very quickly with AccessNI. Similar problems occurred when the  Criminal Records Bureau was established in England  and Wales.  It is extremely disappointing that we find ourselves in the same position and  that lessons do not seem to have been learned. For whatever reason, that is  totally unacceptable and must be resolved immediately if public confidence in  vetting is not to be undermined.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">We have heard countless examples today of organisations  that are unable to recruit quickly to a range of posts and sectors, which  causes real hardship. That is also unacceptable, and decisive action is  required. In my own constituency, Comber YFC had to wait almost four months  before its youth worker could begin work. As for volunteers, there is a  constant delay in the process, and, subsequently, people tend to lose interest  and move on to some other charities while waiting. It has become rather like a  lottery for individuals who want to offer their services &mdash; they simply make  themselves available to a selection of youth charities and the one that comes  back the quickest is where they go.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Following the Bichard Inquiry, new legislation is in the  offing in the form of the safeguarding vulnerable groups Order, and in the  radical new vetting and barring regimes that are being introduced by that  legislation in Northern    Ireland in October 2009. AccessNI will play  a pivotal role in that, and will process applications for the new continuous  monitoring scheme. Current problems will be dwarfed by what will come at that  point. It is absolutely essential that problems in business processing and  timescales are resolved.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister, Paul Goggins, has taken a personal interest  in this issue. I add my voice to the call for him to ensure, as a matter of  importance, that the turnaround time for enhanced disclosure is brought back to  four weeks. It is essential that he acts, and does so quickly. It may be also  be very helpful if the Minister were to appear in person before the Education  and Health Committees to advise as to the current position.</p>
	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  The problem with speaking at this stage of a debate is that everything that  could possibly be said on the subject has already been said by a variety of  Members. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, as will other Members in the House,  that is not something that has stopped me in the past, and it is not something  that will stop me now.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">It is refreshing that there has been unanimity throughout  the Chamber on this very important issue. Having listened to the debate, it is  clear that few MLAs or constituencies have not been adversely affected by this  matter and, throughout the summer and recently, MLAs have encountered a broad  range of complaints from various sectors about it.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I shall address the points that were made by several  Members. However, nothing that I say should be misconstrued as a call for a  rolling back of the structures that are in place &mdash; far from it. We have heard  about various horrors over the years in the education sector, in nursing homes  and in the health sector, and about the dreadful things that can go wrong if  checks into people&rsquo;s background fail to happen. That is not a situation to  which we wish to return; we want to move on.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the breadth and depth of AccessNI&rsquo;s strong system  of checks into people who work with children and vulnerable adults. That system  co-ordinates the work of the Northern Ireland Office, the police, the  Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, and the Department of  Education. I welcome that system&rsquo;s alignment with the rest of the UK, and I  welcome AccessNI&rsquo;s ambitious targets. I am sure that we all agree that, if  delivered, four weeks for an enhanced check is a reasonable amount of time for  someone to accept and take up a post and to offer notice to an employer. In  such situations, everything should move relatively smoothly.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">However, the system of which we are so welcoming is not  working; it is badly failing many people. As many Members said, it is ironic  that a system that is meant to protect children and vulnerable people is  actually putting those people at unnecessary risk because it is failing to  deliver its service.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">There are many reasons for being in that predicament;  however, although many are understandable, they are unacceptable. The setting  up of any new agency poses problems. The establishment of AccessNI coincided  with the establishment of many community and voluntary sector and council  summer schemes, and that probably did not help at the start. In addition,  throughout Northern Ireland,  there is a general rise in the uptake of such checks. All of those factors have  had an impact on the predicament in which we find ourselves, but none is  acceptable.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I share some of Naomi Long&rsquo;s concerns. She said that,  although there may be particular failings, there may also be inherent problems  with the system and how it works that have been inherited by AccessNI from the  old system.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I could, as other Members have, recount umpteen examples of  AccessNI&rsquo;s failure to work properly for people in the voluntary and community  sector, the education sector, and the health sector. I have been in contact  with a great many nursing homes that are experiencing real problems, including,  for example, one that attempted to recruit people from India, who were  unable to do their jobs while checks were being processed.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Michelle McIlveen spoke about volunteers who are waiting  for positive checks to be processed, and many good schemes are losing such  volunteers. I spoke with the manager of a community group who said that, having  gone through the process of recruiting an after-school club manager in May, his  clearance did not come through, and therefore that person was not able to start  until September. Consequently, critical time in establishing an after-school  club programme was lost, and that club could not start until well into the  academic year. Those are typical of the type of problems that are being  experienced.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">Jim Shannon spoke about how other councils and groups that  were setting up summer schemes have lost out.</p>
	    <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The impact of all the delays is severe and widespread. Vulnerable  people &mdash; including children and vulnerable adults &mdash; are being deprived of the  services, which are not being delivered. Although not exclusively, in most cases  the least well-off in our society are losing out. By and large, summer schemes  and schemes that are run by the community and voluntary sectors, for example,  are not operating in the most well-off parts of Northern Ireland; they are working  in those communities that very much need those services. Therefore, it is the  people that those services are aimed at &mdash; the elderly, children in care, former  offenders, and the mentally ill &mdash; who are losing out as a result of the checks  not coming through. Therefore, the most vulnerable in our society are suffering  as a result of those problems.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The inability of nursing homes to recruit staff is having  an adverse effect on those businesses and on health targets in general. Working  in a nursing or a care home is not a glamorous job at the best of times; it is  difficult work that is a vocation for many people. Given the current economic  climate, when someone who is seeking employment applies for a job in a nursing  or a care home and finds that there is an inordinate delay in their taking up  that post, there is an obvious attraction for them to work in a corner shop or  in a major supermarket, for example, where they do not have to go through any  vetting process and where the work may be easier or better paid. The nursing or  care homes will then lose out.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I am aware of one nursing home that has had to close one  floor because of the loss of staff that it has suffered and because of its  inability to fill those vacancies quickly, with the result that 12 beds are not  being filled. Therefore, 12 elderly people with care needs could be in those  beds and getting the service that they require. However, that is not happening.  That also has an adverse effect on the operation of that nursing home as a  business, and it does not help to ease the problem of bed blocking.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">It was mentioned that there is a cost to an organisation as  a result of losing out on a person whom it wanted to recruit &mdash; it must  re-advertise the position and pay another fee for an enhanced check. There is  also a cost to the worker, given that some people may want to take up a post  but are unable to do so and are, therefore, losing out on the money that they  would earn over that time.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">The problem has been acknowledged at the appropriate levels  of Government, and, as has been mentioned, temporary measures to deal with it  have been put in place. However, it is clear that those measures are not  working either. The letters that were to be issued have been delayed, with the  result that that process has not been simple and straightforward. The letters  are certainly not a long-term solution and are not entirely appropriate for  people who are offering one-to-one care. In many ways, the letters are putting  the burden on organisations and businesses to employ someone and, in doing so,  to take a risk. That is not something that I or any Member would encourage a business  to do.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, the problem has been acknowledged at the highest  level. That is a start, at least. It would help if Access Northern Ireland  information were made accessible to us, as elected representatives, and to the  businesses and organisations that use it. Along with other Members, I am  concerned that, at times, it is impossible to gain information from Access  Northern Ireland  and that, at other times, such information is released quite slowly. From  speaking to other Members, I know that they have also encountered that problem.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not know whether the problem is with the system, with  the availability of resources, or whether it is a combination of both. I  suspect that it is a systemic problem and that the structure must be improved  and supported with the appropriate resources. Whatever the problem, a solution  must be found, because far too many people in our society who are vulnerable  and in need of the services that are provided by various businesses and groups  in our community are losing out. That is unacceptable. I therefore commend the  motion.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyText"><strong>Resolved</strong>:</p>
	    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes the waiting time for POCVA checks to  be processed; further notes that this is adversely affecting child care  centres, amongst other employers; and asks the Secretary of State to  investigate the situation and ensure that applications are processed as a  matter of urgency.</p>
	    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Adjourned at 4.49 pm.</p>
