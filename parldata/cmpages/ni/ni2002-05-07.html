                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is my understanding that the text is being
                made available as I speak. The delay arose simply because the
                text was not finalised until about 10 minutes ago.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last Thursday, the Prime Minister and the
                Chancellor of the Exchequer visited Belfast. The Deputy First
                Minister and I will this morning provide the Assembly with
                details of the major new reinvestment and reform initiative that
                we negotiated on behalf of the Executive with the Prime Minister
                and the Chancellor, and explain its purpose.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those negotiations have been undertaken over
                recent months but were only concluded last week. Members will
                appreciate that it was not possible to consult earlier. However,
                I assure the Assembly that as we take this work forward we will
                consult widely. That is essential, because this initiative opens
                a significant new stage in the development of our
                Administration, a new means to make a real difference to the
                people of Northern Ireland and, in particular, to turn around
                the major deficit in our infrastructure and modernise some of
                our key services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Devolution hands responsibility for providing
                good government to Northern Ireland’s politicians and people.
                People want good services, fairly and efficiently administered,
                and they look to the Assembly to provide them. We will work
                together to deliver reform and reinvestment in public services.
                The Executive have placed that at the centre of their programme.
                We need a new debate about services and the necessary hard
                choices. We must all accept that good services must be paid for,
                planned and expertly managed. Resources and reform must go
                together.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The last time locally-elected representatives
                were able to debate and take decisions was some 30 years ago.
                Then there was a strategy for public investment. Since then,
                temporary arrangements and decisions by those with no organic
                connection with society here saw years of underinvestment,
                leaving huge infrastructure problems in water, health, transport
                and education. Now we must prioritise. We must decide how best
                to close the gap, what can be done now and what must wait. We
                must look strategically at our asset base, take stock and set a
                new direction. We must be open and explain those choices to the
                Assembly and to the people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The five core elements of the initiative are
                £200 million available for investment over the next two years;
                a new borrowing power for the longer term; the transfer of some
                strategic military and security assets to the Executive; the
                creation of a new strategic investment body; and a major
                programme of public service reform to secure greater expertise
                and effectiveness.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is clear that reinvestment and reform in
                our public services are essential. For decades investment in
                public service infrastructure fell well short of what was
                required to meet the needs of our community. Under direct rule,
                priority was given to allocating resources to security. That
                inevitably meant that, over time, capital investment for
                services was neglected. We see evidence of that plainly today.
                The scale of the problem can be seen in hospitals and schools
                and in the state of our roads and transport systems. Many,
                however, do not realise that our water and sewerage
                infrastructure, hidden from view, is also in a poor state and
                needs major work urgently.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is calculated that £6 billion extra will
                be needed over the next two decades to address the deficit
                inherited by the Executive and the Assembly. With devolution we
                have the opportunity to do something about it. The Executive
                have explored possible ways of addressing the problem. In our
                first year, we established the infrastructure and capital
                renewal Executive programme fund to support strategic projects,
                such as rail, road, energy and telecommunications projects. That
                includes the use, where appropriate, of public-private
                partnerships (PPPs). We have so far allocated £79&nbsp;million
                from that fund, topping up the resources allocated from
                mainstream Budgets.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last year we also launched a major review of
                the opportunities for PPPs and other sources of funding. Our aim
                has been to identify whether, and how, we might make progress in
                improving our public services by drawing on other sources of
                capital and, equally importantly, other sources of managerial
                expertise. The PPP working group established by the Executive
                has completed its work, and the Executive will shortly seek
                views on its report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although we have made some progress, it is
                also clear that more radical ideas are needed to address the
                backlog of investment, given the pressing demands for resources.
                It was in that context that the Deputy First Minister and I set
                out to negotiate additional forms of support and finance. Many
                in the Assembly and outside have urged us to explore alternative
                sources of funding, and that we have done.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With assistance from the Prime Minister and
                the Chancellor, we now have a package that will accelerate the
                work that is so badly needed. Using it in conjunction with other
                sources of finance, we should be able to replace old assets with
                new. Indeed, we can now start to consider other opportunities
                for investment across our public services that previously we
                would not have had the resources to contemplate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The key to the initiative is that we have
                been able to gain the Prime Minister’s and the Chancellor’s
                agreement to the Executive’s being able to avail of a new
                borrowing power. That will enable us, if the Executive and the
                Assembly so decide, to launch a multibillion pound programme to
                improve our assets. The Executive will be able to borrow from
                the Treasury at highly advantageous interest rates, going
                directly to the gilt market. Interestingly, access to such
                borrowing has been an issue that many, including the Committee
                for Finance and Personnel, have pressed on us. Therefore, I am
                pleased that we have achieved this breakthrough. It provides the
                opportunity to significantly increase the pace of investment in
                Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We do not want to depend solely on the
                borrowing power. We must consider also how other sources of
                funding may be used to enhance it. The scale of the task means
                that we must consider too how we can lever in resources through
                public-private partnerships. However, we will ensure that, where
                that approach is taken, it represents the best way to serve the
                public interest. If used properly, public-private partnerships
                could be of real benefit. That is especially so because they can
                bring to bear expert management of contracts and assets to which
                the public sector has not previously had access, and the theme
                of expertise is one to which we will return.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The new borrowing power could be used to
                finance projects in all the public services for which we are
                responsible. In parallel with the proposed changes for local
                government finance in England and Wales, we must satisfy the
                requirements of the new Chartered Institute of Public Finance
                and Accountancy code. The borrowing will also be subject to a
                limit set by the Treasury.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As legislation at Westminster is required,
                the new borrowing regime will not be available until 2004-05 at
                the earliest. It will only proceed on the basis of funding
                priorities established by the Executive and the Assembly.
                However, as the Deputy First Minister will explain, we have also
                negotiated a short-term borrowing arrangement that can be put
                into effect now, without a change in legislation, to set in
                train a major programme of investment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a fact of life for all of us who have
                mortgages or who take out loans that borrowing must be repaid.
                Since last week we have seen and heard ill-informed stories
                about huge hikes in rates to pay back the borrowing. There are
                several points that must be emphasised. The Executive have made
                it clear that they will not propose increases above the pattern
                of recent years unless the present rating system has been
                reviewed and we have an acceptable local revenue system. Any
                changes that arise from the review of rating policy must be
                phased in over several years so that we can avoid any sudden
                changes in the bills required of any sector, business or
                individual.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have agreed a borrowing power with the
                Treasury. It will be up to the Executive and the Assembly to
                decide whether to borrow to pay for new assets and, if so, by
                how much. That provides a real opportunity to invest in our
                infrastructure, and the Executive have agreed that we should
                pursue the proposed new arrangements with the Treasury.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must work within the Treasury’s strict
                rules on the control of public spending, which preclude the use
                of efficiency savings or asset sales to service debt. We will
                make fresh efforts to secure efficiency gains as part of the
                reform dimension of the initiative. We will also require a
                radical look at the assets held by Departments to free up any
                spare resources.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue of the revenues that we raise from
                the domestic sector was inevitably going to arise in the
                spending review. It has been said many times that it is
                impossible to expect the Treasury to accept our arguments for
                money to sustain the same standards of public services as in
                England if our revenue levels are much lower.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.45 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Without this initiative, we might have had to
                increase rates in the longer term to make ends meet for basic
                services. The reinvestment and reform initiative has given us an
                opportunity, and we can use additional revenue to lever in major
                investment in infrastructure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the title implies, the initiative is also
                about public service reform. We must increase resources, but we
                must not focus solely on the quantity of projects and the number
                of supporting staff. We must focus also on the quality of
                project implementation and subsequent service delivery. As an
                Executive, we are committed to improving delivery and value for
                money. We underlined the importance of modernising Government
                and of improving its efficiency and effectiveness in the
                Programme for Government. The introduction of resource
                budgeting, public service agreements and service delivery
                agreements means that much of the information necessary for that
                change is available. That should enable us to get better
                information about the true costs of services and about what is
                being achieved, and we have added to that by commissioning
                evaluations of the needs and effectiveness of major policy
                areas. Those cover approximately three quarters of the
                expenditure that we control.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With the work on a new procurement system
                that is taking place across Departments we should also see
                improvements. The major review of public administration in the
                coming months will examine all aspects of administration,
                including the quality of service, and it should provide a good
                opportunity for improvement. Likewise, the new investment body
                should be an important vehicle for helping to deliver public
                service reform. However, reform must go wider. We must focus
                more on delivering services and on placing customer service and
                the needs of front-line staff first. Technology can play a vital
                role in improving services and information, increasingly
                allowing the public to use services when it is convenient for
                them. Technology must become more significant in the Programme
                for Government, and integral to the work of all Departments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have already seen signs of significant
                development. The creation of Invest Northern Ireland and the
                joint development of our welfare and employment systems are
                examples of where new approaches that are aimed at better
                meeting the needs of the public have been developed. However, we
                must go further. I do not wish to see public service budgets
                increasing in future unless reform is a key condition. The
                public deserve that and need to know that the best management
                techniques are being used to provide a service, and that
                internal administration is using minimum resources. We all want
                improvement in the delivery of public services with the
                resources and the expertise that are available to help us. We
                must change how we do things rather than continue with previous
                practice. We believe that we have a better opportunity than ever
                to further that objective.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This reform package is the largest that we
                have had. With the strategic investment body and our ability to
                borrow, it has wide ramifications for the public services. It
                will change style and mindset and put new thinking and energy
                into the Government. We are eager and determined to have real
                change. We are taking seriously our responsibility to the
                public, and we are determined to transform the quality of
                services. We want our new democracy to deliver real benefits to
                the public.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister (Mr Durkan):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I join with the First Minister in apologising
                to the House that the continuing work on the statement meant
                that it was unavailable for Members before its delivery.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The initiative presents a challenge to us
                all. We must consider our priorities and, in particular, what
                should be addressed in the short term. We must consider whether
                there are new ways of delivering services. Much that was
                previously impossible should now be possible. The First Minister
                and I will work with the Minister of Finance and Personnel, and
                with all our ministerial Colleagues, to develop a programme that
                brings substantial benefits to the people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I stress that because, although we will be
                setting up a new strategic investment body and must use the best
                quality expertise to assist with the implementation of that
                work, choosing the direction of the programme rests with the
                Executive working with the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Through the Programme for Government, we will
                agree which areas of deficit will be addressed first. Those
                political decisions must be settled on the Floor of the Chamber.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister explained the
                opportunities to increase resources through longer-term
                borrowing and to revitalise public services. The other threads
                of the initiative are to take a more strategic approach to
                investment through a new body; to use former military and
                security assets; and to use the facility to borrow money in the
                short term.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The adoption of a more strategic approach to
                the infrastructure and public service investment is a key
                element of the initiative. In that way we will deliver the best
                investment programme for the region. Before the launch of the
                new institutions, infrastructure investment in public services
                and utilities, such as hospitals, schools, roads, transport,
                water and sewerage, was characterised by a piecemeal,
                departmentalised, non-strategic and largely reactive approach.
                Expertise and resources are currently spread across 11
                Departments, each of which is responsible for delivering its own
                programme. The Programme for Government emphasises the
                importance of improving the way in which we work together across
                the Departments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have already consulted widely on how to
                improve public sector procurement generally. A new central body
                that will draw in the best private sector expertise is already
                planned. In responding to the need to improve the
                infrastructure, there is potential to improve co-ordination and
                to ensure that the available expertise will result in better
                service delivery. Therefore, we propose that a new organisation
                be created to work with, and on behalf of, the Executive and all
                Departments to deliver infrastructure programmes in a more
                strategic way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposed new body would be able to use a
                mixture of sources of finance, including the new borrowing
                power, traditional public sector finance and public-private
                partnerships. The body would link the finance to the best
                procurement methods, whether those involve the public or private
                sectors, or a combination of both. Using those, it would produce
                much better solutions than would be possible if the resources
                were spread across all the services, with each Department left
                to develop its own expertise and deliver its own projects.
                Therefore, it should be possible to take a more strategic
                approach to public-private partnerships.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many of our Departments are relatively small
                and would experience difficulties in developing and maintaining
                the expertise and drive required to make the projects work.
                Ministers will decide what projects, buildings, and so on, will
                be required, so there will be a clear political responsibility
                for prioritising and planning. However, delivery and financing
                will now be overseen on a strategic basis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The strategic investment body represents a
                new and highly innovative approach. We wish to examine closely
                examples elsewhere, drawing on the best expertise. The
                initiative is about reinvestment and reform, but it is also a
                major step towards the normalisation of our society. During the
                troubles, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and the Northern Ireland
                Office (NIO) made use of extensive assets. A process of
                normalisation should bring about a reduction in security
                requirements. Normally, the NIO and the MoD would sell their
                surplus assets, and the Departments would have the opportunity
                to purchase them. However, for several years, we have been
                arguing that the Government should take a more positive approach
                and accept that the resources should be used to strengthen the
                social and economic fabric.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 2000, it was agreed that we would be
                consulted on the use of the sites as they became available for
                disposal. I am delighted that a significant part of the new
                initiative is the Government’s agreement to transfer to the
                Executive, at no charge, some of the exceptionally significant
                assets that are, or will shortly become, surplus to
                requirements. The sites, which the Chancellor mentioned at the
                Odyssey last Thursday, are: Ebrington Barracks; the Maze Prison,
                including the base adjacent to the prison; the bases at
                Magherafelt and Malone Road; and Crumlin Road Prison.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those are significant assets, and should help
                support a major programme of economic and social renewal for the
                whole community — a community that has been through a long
                period of conflict.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to take the opportunities of a stable
                and peaceful society, and those sites present tremendous
                opportunities. It is particularly important that sites and
                assets that, up to now, have been associated with militarisation
                and conflict should be transformed into engines of peaceful
                economic and social regeneration. We are now considering how
                best their potential can be developed to fulfil the needs of the
                community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government have also agreed that as
                further sites become available, it will be for the Executive to
                address how they may be used to promote economic and social
                regeneration on a strategic basis, although we cannot
                necessarily infer further transfers without charge.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The major programme of infrastructure
                investment will take some time to develop. The new borrowing
                power, on which that depends, will be subject to the passing of
                new legislation through Parliament. More importantly, as the
                First Minister has just stressed, we need to radically review
                the system of local revenue, and establish, as a first condition
                before increases can be considered, a system that is fair and
                acceptable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, we need to make an early start with
                the implementation of the initiative, and we have agreed with
                the Chancellor that the Executive will be able to borrow £125
                million in the next two years. The Executive wish to maximise
                the impact of this new money, and they will be adding
                £75&nbsp;million of resources that have become available from
                Departments, enabling a more strategic use of those resources
                than would otherwise have been possible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we were negotiating this shorter-term
                boost to investment, the new regional cancer centre was among
                the significant projects that we had in mind. We will also
                consider how the £200 million should be used in conjunction
                with the Executive programme funds to maximise the investment
                impact. We will be looking at renewal and purchasing of
                important new equipment, improving our roads, and other
                investments that we can pursue in the short term.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The £125 million borrowed from the Treasury
                will have to be repaid through existing revenue income, which
                will be available from the regional rate. There have been
                reports about major increases in the rates. The First Minister
                has explained the position in relation to the longer-term
                borrowing power. However, we should also be clear about the
                short-term borrowing arrangement. The £125 million loan will be
                repaid from revenue income currently planned, and will not
                require increases in the rates.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much work now needs to be done to implement
                the initiative, and the First Minister, the Minister of Finance
                and Personnel and I will be working with our ministerial
                Colleagues in the coming weeks and months to realise the full
                potential of this important package. We will keep Members
                informed of developments, and I am sure that Members will wish
                to offer views and ideas on how the community could most benefit
                from the changes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The establishment of the strategic investment
                body will be a major task, and we wish to start work on it right
                away. The parties on the Executive will be invited to nominate
                members to a project board, chaired by OFMDFM nominees, to
                develop the proposals for the new body. An Executive
                subcommittee is to be established to oversee the work. We wish
                to call on expertise from the Treasury, 10 Downing Street, the
                South and further afield to help develop our ideas. We also
                propose to fully involve the Assembly through the Committee of
                the Centre and the Committee for Finance and Personnel.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have given details today of the initiative
                — an initiative that promises substantial additional resources
                for Northern Ireland through short- and longer-term borrowing,
                and from the transfer of exceptional security and military
                assets to the Executive. We believe that this initiative should
                help provide a welcome boost for our economy, and improved
                services for our community, for this and for future generations.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.00 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also have other work to do. The Treasury
                spending review is under way and is due to be completed in the
                summer. Our agreement with the Treasury on the reinvestment and
                reform initiative is separate from our negotiation on the
                spending review. We and the Treasury are agreed; the two are not
                connected.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The recent Budget announcement of large
                increases for health funding brought home the difficulties of
                matching expenditure increases to comparable programmes in
                England while the Barnett formula continues to be applied. We
                will continue to press for a fairer system of allocations across
                the UK, which better recognises Northern Ireland’s higher
                needs. However, the Treasury will undoubtedly continue to focus
                on the level of local revenues in Northern Ireland relative to
                England. The Executive and the Assembly will need to consider
                this issue further, particularly in the context of the rating
                policy review. The Executive will not propose increases in rates
                above the patterns of recent years to the Assembly until we have
                had the opportunity to consider the outcome of the review.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Irrespective of the outcome of the UK
                spending review this year, we will not have all the resources we
                will need. Later this year, the Executive will need to consider
                priorities for spending across programmes, taking account of
                needs and effectiveness in the context of the Programme for
                Government. To initiate this process, the Executive intend to
                present their position report for this year’s development of
                the Programme for Government and Budget to the Assembly early
                next month.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When presenting their Programme for
                Government to the Assembly, the Executive said that it was about
                making a difference. The process is different: a local
                Administration is responsible for making decisions on local
                issues and for addressing local needs. We also want a different
                outcome: quality of services and quality of life for all people
                in Northern Ireland. That difference justifies all the work of
                the Executive and the Assembly. The reinvestment and reform
                initiative, which the First Minister and I have described,
                provides everyone with an additional opportunity to make a real
                difference.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The initiative is not a magic solution: there
                are no soft options. Political life is about hard choices —
                the ones that the public look to us to make. However, the
                initiative opens up new ways of dealing with those choices and
                new ways of drawing in expertise and better management. If we
                make the right choices, we will be helping to invest for the
                future, improve our public services and provide real benefits
                for local people. Everyone should work to realise the potential
                of the initiative. I commend it to the Assembly.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee of the
                Centre (Mr Poots):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I doubt that the wordsmiths of the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister had any opportunity to
                get away over the bank holiday, but given the amount of spin
                that has been put on the statement, they did not need to take
                their families to any waltzers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to comment on several matters that
                were raised. The First Minister said that rates will not rise
                more than they have over the past two years. The public must be
                aware that that is already four times the rate of inflation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When will the current rating review be
                completed? Given that we cannot use the borrowing powers until
                2004-05, the review should be completed by then, and the outcome
                should be put in place. Today’s promises that rates are not
                going to rise significantly seem to be somewhat hollow.</p>

                particularly manufacturing industry, cease? Are we going to stop

                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">— will the First Minister and the Deputy
                First Minister consult with local communities and public
                representatives in those areas and take full account of the
                proposals made by local people?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr Poots for emphasising that over
                the next couple of years the existing pattern of rates increases
                will continue without dramatic change. The existing pattern
                involves increases, but we do not intend to move sharply away
                from that pattern over the next two years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The review of rating will be launched very
                soon, and we hope that it will be completed within a year.
                However, it could take longer than we would like, for we intend
                to consult fully. A whole range of local interest groups is keen
                to be involved in the rating review. We realise how sensitive
                the issue is, so there will be full consultation. Decisions will
                then have to be made. The review opens up the possibility of
                considering other ways of financing local government. While
                there is a focus on the rates, the door is not closed to people
                coming forward with fresh ideas about structures of local
                government finance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots raised several detailed questions
                about derating for charities, industry, and so on. All aspects
                of the rating system will be re-examined. When the review of
                rating is published, Members will see that those issues have
                been raised. We will see what views are put to us before coming
                back to the Executive and to the Assembly to find out how we
                should proceed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ideally, the review will be complete and
                implemented in time for the new arrangements that will kick in
                in 2004. Whether that ideal is realised is a matter for
                ourselves and for society as we proceed over the next two years.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister on securing this package for the benefit
                of the people of Northern Ireland. Can the Ministers confirm
                that the short-term package of £200 million will be available
                to the Executive without any additional burden being placed on
                the ratepayer?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am happy to give the Member that assurance.
                The £200 million package comprises a loan of £125&nbsp;million
                from the Treasury, and that borrowing can be covered from
                existing rate revenues. We do not have to add to the patterns of
                increase that we have projected to fund that short-term
                borrowing power. The other element of the package is £75
                million of our own resources, using money available from
                Departments’ underspends and end-year flexibility. Applying
                the money in that way to create the £200 million spending boost
                represents the best value for money and the best strategic use
                of the money. The £200 million will be spent in a way that
                combines and complements the further spending that we have to
                undertake with regard to the Executive programme funds.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gallagher:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the statement and congratulate the
                First Minister and the Deputy First Minister on the negotiations
                that brought about the package. Members, myself included, have
                frequently and urgently called for additional resources for
                schools, colleges, hospitals and roads. The initiative gives us
                the opportunity to make positive choices for better quality
                services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been a good deal of speculation
                about rates. Will the First Minister assure the House that
                decisions about rates, whether in the light of the package or as
                part of the rating review, will not be taken without fully
                consulting the Assembly?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Full consultation with the Assembly will take
                place. Any decisions to be made will come through the Executive
                to the House. However, even before decisions are taken, there
                will be a full consultation on the question of local government
                revenue and forms of finance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Choices must be made. It is an uncomfortable
                fact that revenue from rates in Northern Ireland runs below the
                level of revenue collected through council tax and other
                analogous methods across the water. It is difficult to draw
                exact comparisons. Some of the figures bandied about in the
                local press are unrecognisable. However, there is a difference.
                When arguing for additional money from the Treasury, the issues
                of equality and the taxpayer’s interest must be addressed.
                That matter arises irrespective of this exercise. The question
                of the comparability of local revenue will have to be addressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As long as we can show the Treasury that the
                Assembly can conduct its business in a responsible fashion, we
                shall be able to manage changes without making sudden increases.
                That is a general principle, regardless of the new initiative.
                The initiative presents the prospect of significant borrowing
                power, which will give us greater flexibility in the planning
                stages. In the course of life, people regularly borrow in order
                to handle major investments in a more convenient way. We can
                look at that issue over the next year or two before decisions
                have to be taken.</p>

                opportunity to read it and to do it justice by asking the
                Ministers probing questions. I would have preferred that the
                statement be delayed until this afternoon to give us the chance
                to read it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the assets — in the form of military
                establishments — that have been transferred to the Northern
                Ireland Executive attract an annual 6% charge under the resource
                accounting regime? If so, what impact will that have on our
                block grant and departmental expenditure limit?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am delighted to have the categorical
                assurance of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister
                that rates will not be doubled in the next four to five years.
                However, I welcome even more the fact that minds are now open to
                other ways of raising finance. I assume, therefore, that the
                First Minister and the Deputy First Minister now have an open
                mind on the concept of local income tax. Do they share with me
                the idea that that is a much fairer way to raise revenue than
                the current iniquitous rates system?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept that Mr Close has not had time to
                read the statement. However, in my experience, regardless of
                what I say in a statement, or of how much time the Member has to
                read it, he pays little attention to it, and does not rely on it
                anyway. Perhaps the Member is making a new departure in that
                regard.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The assets will be transferred to the
                Executive; therefore, they must be accounted for in the same way
                as are other assets. When I was the Minister of Finance and
                Personnel, I emphasised that resource accounting and budgeting
                would involve a significant change in how assets are treated. In
                addition to controlling the flow of spending, the Assembly now
                controls the stock of assets, which we must account for and
                treat in the manner that Mr Close described. That is why it is
                imperative that we put the sites to best use, enable others to
                do so, and make the best decisions about those assets. We will
                be working to that end.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A review of rating policy began some time
                ago, and the first stage is now complete. The Minister of
                Finance and Personnel will soon issue a public consultation
                document based on the work that was carried out during the first
                stage of the review. That document will set out all the issues
                on rates. We do not need Members’ scare stories about the
                removal of relief from charity shops or a massive increase in
                business rates. I was criticised — <i>[Interruption].</p>

                Personnel, I was criticised by several councils because I would
                not withdraw relief for charity shops. The matter will be
                included in the rating policy review for Members and the public
                to see, so that a fairer system of generating local revenue can
                be achieved. All the necessary facts will be included in the
                review; we do not need scare stories. We will examine the
                issues, make decisions on them and move forward. Anyone is free
                to argue that a local income tax would be better; however, that
                is not on the agenda of the rating policy review. There is no
                ulterior agenda; we need to consider honestly and hard-headedly
                the need to raise local revenue, and we must ensure that we do
                so fairly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards scare stories about business
                rates, the Executive have increased business rates by 3·3% in
                the past few years, which was as close as possible to the rate
                of inflation. They did not increase it further, nor did they
                increase it at the same rate as domestic charges, because they
                recognised and emphasised that businesses in Northern Ireland
                already pay rates equivalent to those paid by businesses across
                the water. Neither the Treasury nor anyone else could argue that
                we have a gap to close in business rates — <i>[Interruption].</p>

                However, the package from the Chancellor should bear a large
                bright label that reads &quot;handle with care&quot;, because
                much small print must be read, and clarification is needed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How much will it cost to borrow the £125
                million that we have already agreed to accept? I do not want to

                cost. Secondly, how much will it cost us to borrow
                £1&nbsp;billion, or other larger amounts? Has an interest rate
                been fixed?</p>

                Minister made an announcement containing much spin about
                investing in future generations. Is it not rather the case that

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree that we need to handle these things
                with care, and I wish that commentators would do so also. We see
                remarkable stories in the media about what this will mean. As
                was stated openly and clearly, this is a matter of taking on
                power, and the question arises of how and when it is to be used.
                In our lives we purchase major capital items such as cars and
                houses, and rather than save the cost from income, we usually
                borrow. The costs involved will depend on the rates available
                and how they are drawn down. Crucially, we can cover the cost of
                borrowing £125 million initially with existing departmental
                budgets.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The cost will depend on when it is drawn
                down. For example, if £1 billion is borrowed, the cost depends
                on the interest rates at the time. The rates available at the
                moment are around 5·25%, so that would mean expenditure of
                around £75 million, which is a competitive rate.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes. The current rate is 5·25%, and it is
                better than floating a bond. The Member will note that we intend
                to create a strategic investment body. The body will maximise
                available public finance expertise and explore a range of
                possible sources of finance, which includes borrowing from the
                Treasury, using assets more effectively and raising funds
                through public-private partnerships.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One must not assume that the cost of all the
                investment infrastructure will be met by borrowing. There is the
                possibility of exploring public-private partnerships and using
                them to lever in more finance. Borrowing can provide funds,
                which can be used to bring in similar or greater funds. While we
                cannot use the proceeds of the disposal of assets to fund
                borrowing, we can use them to fund investment, so infrastructure
                investment can come from a number of sources. Those who see a
                need for several billion pounds to be spent on infrastructure
                and assume that it will all come from borrowing are wrong. Some
                of the figures that I have given are within our resources, even
                if we borrow. Our Budget is in excess of £5 billion, and it
                should be possible to find £30 million, £40 million, £50
                million or maybe £75 million a year to fund substantial
                borrowing. However, that would be on the basis of our agreeing
                the detail with the Treasury, and we are still in discussion on
                how we should handle longer-term borrowing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I did not give the Member a specific answer
                about the cost of borrowing £125 million in the short term. I
                understand that the loan is likely to cost less than £10
                million a year, based on repayment over 25 years.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I suppose we will know soon enough whether
                Santa Claus has come early to Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must find out the finer details of the
                financial package, and how it stacks up economically. Will the
                Committees have opportunities to fully discuss the package and
                its financial implications?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the recent developments concerning
                Ebrington Barracks, which is in my constituency. High-level
                discussions have been taking place for some time to try to
                secure public ownership of the site. Will there be wide
                consultation in the Foyle constituency — particularly in the
                Waterside area — on the future use of the site? Many useful
                discussions have been held with various bodies in the city about
                that. However, now that the Executive have control of the site,
                many people in the community are worried about whether such
                consultation will continue.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept the Member’s point that people
                will want to appraise the package. Any future use of borrowing
                power by any Executive will be subject to the full scrutiny of
                the budgetary process, not least because additional borrowing
                would be resourced through additional revenue raised from rates.
                Nothing will bring about more transparency in the use of
                borrowing power than that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For that reason, the Executive want to make
                it clear that future borrowing power will be used solely for
                strategic capital investment. Borrowing will not be used to fund
                running costs, pay wages or cover other expenses; it will be
                used solely for strategic infrastructure and public service
                investment. The Executive are conscious that the payments will
                be spread over time, and we want to ensure solidarity between
                generations. This Assembly will provide the necessary public
                service infrastructure for future generations. All the
                Committees will know how those matters are being handled.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The existence of the strategic investment
                body, and the qualitative difference that it makes to our
                capital expenditure profile, will enable the public to see the
                additional benefit of new investment, so that the added value
                will be obvious. That is part of the transparency that is
                important for the public and its representatives in the
                Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member also referred to Ebrington. I am
                aware of, and have been involved in, many discussions about the
                site, because I too represent the Foyle constituency. Having
                made the case to the Prime Minister and the Chancellor for the
                transfer of the sites, the Executive want to ensure that they
                are put to optimum use in the public interest. We will continue
                discussions involving a range of sectoral interests to decide
                the best use of that particular site.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many people urged the Executive and
                Departments to buy some of the sites that have now been
                transferred.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members told us to buy Ebrington Barracks and
                to pay £10 million for it. Instead, through this package, the
                Executive have acquired the sites free of charge. The Executive
                can use the money that Members told us to spend on buying the
                sites to fund £125 million of borrowing power for short-term
                investment.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If Members listened to what they have
                advocated, they would realise how good this deal is. They wanted
                the money to be spent on buying those sites, and additional
                money would then have had to be found to develop them. Instead,
                the sites have been acquired free of charge, and the money that
                would have been spent on buying them can now be put towards
                infrastructure and public service investment.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Savage:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the statement and the package that
                goes with it. This is mature politics in action, which is long
                overdue in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can the First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister confirm that the investment needed for water services
                alone is around £3 billion, or £6 million a week for 10 years?
                If that investment were not made, what would the consequences
                be? The Assembly and the public want to know whether the
                Minister for Regional Development has made any suggestions on
                how to meet the responsibility and the enormous backlog. I hope
                that he does not take the same attitude as his Colleague Mr
                Poots, who sits back and complains and lets other people do the
                work for him.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The information that we have received from
                the Department for Regional Development is that a substantial
                investment of around £3 billion is needed for water services.
                We cannot sit on that issue. It must be dealt with.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A point was raised earlier about the charges
                that would be incurred on the bases that have been transferred:
                those charges come under the new regime of resource accounting
                and budgeting and involve a charge of some 6% for held assets.
                Water services have considerable assets. Under resource
                accounting and budgeting, we would be charged for those assets.
                Consequently, there would be significant additional charges.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also the issue of how the
                Administration is funded. Funding increases come with per capita
                equivalents to increases in England in Wales. There are no
                longer any increases in public expenditure on water in England
                and Wales. No additional money is available in that way. If we
                are to deal with the investment that is needed in the water
                sector, additional sources of finance must be found. That is an
                important matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">European Union Directives are a source of
                concern for water services. Those Directives will require
                expenditure, and if they are not implemented, penalties will be
                incurred. That is an important issue that must be addressed
                urgently. We understand that the Minister for Regional
                Development is considering how to deal with those problems, and
                he may soon introduce proposals. Those proposals may address the
                raising of finance, if finance is to be raised at all. I do not
                know whether that matter is on the Minister’s mind. However,
                we will consider with interest his proposals for water services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department for Regional Development has
                significant problems. Other Departments also have problems with
                infrastructure. We hope that the package will benefit all
                Ministers and will enable matters to be dealt with strategically
                without displacing the interests and responsibilities of
                individual Ministers. That is why, as the Deputy First Minister
                said, we will invite other parties to associate with the
                operation of the strategic investment body.</p>

                Deputy First Minister on taking the steps that secured the
                package. Everyone agrees that more resources should be put into
                public services, and all parties have, in one way or another,
                called for such investment. The package offers a chance to
                accelerate investment in vital services. I also welcome the
                response given to Mr Hay regarding public consultation on
                Ebrington Barracks.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can the Deputy First Minister confirm that
                the initial package will be spent on strategic investments such
                as the new cancer centre, so that people can see that devolution
                does make a difference, and that we advocate quality public
                services to meet society’s needs?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I said, the First Minister, the Minister
                of Finance and Personnel and myself raised issues that would be
                significant elements in the shorter-term when we negotiated the
                short-term spending boost as part of the overall package. The
                cancer centre was the primary significant project that we
                thought could be funded from a short-term package. All Assembly
                parties know how important the regional cancer centre is to the
                regional health strategy. Achieving the regional cancer strategy
                will make good the work of the important new cancer units.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are determined — and we are sure that
                our Executive Colleagues are determined — to support the
                Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in
                realising the regional cancer strategy. We regret the different
                things that have prevented progress being made, and it is for
                such reasons that we believed it important to secure a
                short-term dividend, and not just to rely on longer-term
                borrowing power. Decisions and announcements on precisely how
                the money will be used will follow.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last week, I was tempted to hijack a plane
                that was supposed to be arriving laden with millions of pounds.
                However, the roads infrastructure in west Tyrone was so bad that
                there were no white lines to guide the plane down.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, have Government bonds been ruled out?
                Is that a good financial manoeuvre in view of the fact that
                loans would be long-term? Are we talking about a fixed-term
                contract with an interest rate of 5·25% for 20 or 30 years?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, other means of raising money were
                mentioned. I welcome that the Deputy First Minister said that he
                would inflation-proof the business rates. Could there be a
                tremendous hike in domestic rates to compensate for that? What
                are the other means of raising money, and will they be put into
                the public domain for consultation?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The prospect of issuing bonds to finance
                infrastructure investments has some attractions, but all bonds
                would ultimately have to be guaranteed by the Northern Ireland
                Executive. The Treasury has made it clear that it would not
                support a bond-financed approach, nor would it be prepared to
                act as ultimate guarantor — that would probably be sought from
                financial institutions and investments if a bond were to be
                floated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Significantly, the Treasury’s rates are
                better than those that would be gained from the market on
                floating a bond. It is therefore not simply a matter of the
                Treasury’s difficulties with the concept of bonds. Some of
                those difficulties are not related to Northern Ireland but
                rather to other areas. The arrangements offered are better
                financially, and that is significant.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to other sources of finance, we
                hope to set up public-private partnership (PPP) deals through
                the strategic investment body. PPP partners could raise finance
                through bonds, and they would carry the risk. Other ways of
                raising finance may be available, some of which were referred to
                earlier. The objective of the strategic investment body is to
                bring in expertise and to focus the existing expertise in the
                Administration on examining what is available and what can be
                done to provide the finance to achieve progress in the best
                possible way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Business and domestic rates are not connected
                with this initiative. Rates are already a problem, because of
                comparisons between local taxation and taxation across the
                water. The increase in business rates was kept low because there
                is no significant disparity between business rates here and
                business rates across the water. There is, however, a disparity
                in domestic rates, and there have been significant arguments on
                that issue. We must show that there will be equality with regard
                to tax, rates and council taxes across the United Kingdom. That
                has been happening. I hope that the message is getting through
                that there will be no sudden or dramatic change.</p>

                Executive. Those named so far are of major strategic and
                monetary value. There has been much speculation, in the Lagan
                Valley constituency, for instance, about the possible use of the
                Maze site. Will the Ministers consult fully with local
                authorities and responsible community groups in the areas
                concerned before the use of those sites is determined?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware that in different localities there
                are different levels of interest in the sites, and there has
                already been some debate on the issue. Now that we have the
                sites we must ensure that best use is made of them. In
                determining the best use for the sites, it is important that
                they relate directly to the benefits of a transformation to a
                peaceful situation. They must be symbols of reconciliation, and
                they must be used for regeneration. If the sites were sold, the
                money raised would have to be used for similar purposes. That is
                fair in the context of the normalisation dividend that we
                started to negotiate before Christmas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All relevant local interests must be involved
                and consulted. Strategic interests must also be considered.
                Given that the transfer of particular bases as part of the
                package has been a matter of luck, circumstance and negotiation,
                it would be appropriate to involve the strategic investment

                percentage, if not all, of the borrowing would be unnecessary if
                investment were made as a result of reductions in public
                expenditure? In the light of that, what plans do they have to
                examine the number and cost of Government Departments, the size
                and cost of the Assembly and the amount of money that is

                Perhaps, though, it is not surprising. Is he willing to accept
                the benefits but not the burden of such matters?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is some substance in the Member’s
                comments. We are keenly interested in reducing expenditure where
                possible, and that is an element of the review of public
                administration that will be advanced quickly. We hope that it
                will be implemented in the course of the next year, and, as is
                necessary, it will run in parallel with the review of the rating
                system. We will consider whether significant savings can be made
                in the management of public bodies outside the central
                Departments. The Member may not have appreciated that the
                creation of the strategic investment body to centralise
                expertise on finance and rating and financing projects through
                PPPs may itself involve a reduction in expenditure at
                departmental level.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The cost of the Assembly is not a matter for
                Ministers; it is entirely for the Assembly Commission. However,
                I am confident that the people of Northern Ireland are glad that
                they have an Assembly that enables them to influence the
                decisions that are taken on such matters. The people of Northern
                Ireland are glad that the Assembly exists, and they can put
                value on the carping that comes from people who contributed
                nothing to the creation of the Assembly or to society’s
                progress here in recent years.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I join Members who have congratulated the
                First Minister and the Deputy First Minister on a wonderful
                achievement. It is a strategy for Northern Ireland that I hope
                will help to pay for what we need. At times, our attitude is
                awful. We demand and beg for this, that and the other thing,
                believing that, somehow, the money will fall from heaven. I do
                not know from where people get that idea, but the First Minister
                and the Deputy First Minister have made it clear that heaven
                will not be so easily persuaded to pay for us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members may have heard the Confederation of
                British Industry’s economic expectations for UK regions in
                this morning’s news. Northern Ireland was excluded, and I am
                worried about that. Could this be connected with the serious
                leak that occurred prior to the Chancellor’s announcement last
                Thursday, particularly as the focus of the leak appeared to be
                on a doubling of rates, even though that has proven to be wildly
                inaccurate? Do the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister
                concur with that viewpoint?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for his observations on
                the package that we negotiated. It is important to set the
                matter in context. The First Minister, the Minister of Finance
                and Personnel and I have listened repeatedly to people saying
                that more money and more borrowing power were needed to ensure
                that spending outside the departmental expenditure limit could
                be made. That is precisely what we have negotiated. Most people
                encouraged us towards bonds, but we have negotiated a spending
                power with a better interest rate than we would have been able
                to achieve by using bonds. I hope that everybody — and many
                Members asked us to use bonds to secure a borrowing power —
                would have the same honesty as the Member in congratulating us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are trying to create, in the strategic
                investment body, a central driver to improve the quality and
                rate of investment. The Committee for Finance and Personnel
                touched on that point in its excellent report on public-private
                partnerships and alternative sources of financing. The Committee
                identified such a need precisely, and that need is being made
                good. I hope that the people who were ready to talk about that
                need will welcome the fact that we have acted on it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, much public understanding and
                perception about the initiative was marred by many false
                conclusions and misinterpretations about the rates. In so far as
                that information came from leaks, we must try to correct those
                wrong impressions, while finding out exactly how the leaks
                occurred. The Executive have already asked the head of the Civil
                Service to make enquiries about that. It is most important that
                people are assured that we have a borrowing power that will be
                used wisely, not wildly. The arrangements in the Chamber mean
                that there will be no massive hiking of the rates while the
                rating system remains unreformed and while its anomalies and
                inequities are in place. People will not vote for significant
                rate increases without knowing what the significant additional
                benefits will be.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome this morning’s statement and the
                initiative announced last week. The Deputy First Minister talked
                about the strategic investment body. The important discussions
                on the functions of that body will take place not once my
                Colleague Mr Close has managed to read this morning’s
                statement but when Ministers come to the House with a detailed
                package and say exactly how the body will operate and what its
                role and functions will be. Ministers should not use the
                generalities that we have had so far. The Deputy First Minister
                said that parties in the Executive would be invited to make
                nominations to a working group. That seems to be a new
                constitutional arrangement. Did he mean that Ministers will make
                nominations, or do the Executive plan to be inclusive and
                suggest that parties that participate in the Assembly will get
                such an opportunity?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the fact that the First Minister
                went some distance in his response to Mr Close’s question on
                the unfairness of the rates. In recognising that that is a
                legitimate concern, the First Minister went considerably further
                than his Colleague Sir Reg Empey did in discussions with me last
                week. Are there plans for the rates review to be extended into a
                review of the raising of public finance, or will it merely
                pretend that tinkering with the existing system is all that is
                required?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The consultation paper on the rates review
                will be published shortly. It will concentrate on a review of
                rating policy because, in revising the existing system, we must
                begin by considering that system. The current system contains
                inequities and anomalies. The big problem with rates is that it
                is a tax that is not related to people’s ability to pay; it is
                superficially attractive, therefore, to create a system that is.
                Mr Close mentioned a local income tax. We look forward with
                interest to the proposals for such a tax. I hope that they will
                be properly developed and carefully considered.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not surprising that the Scottish
                Parliament has not used its power to vary income tax rates. That
                shows what those who have the capacity to consider the matter
                think about it. There is the possibility, as I have already
                said, of replacing the rates with a different form of local
                taxation. I do not imagine that anyone will suggest that we
                introduce a poll tax, although someone could, and, under the
                terms of the rates review, it is theoretically possible that
                that could happen. If that is what the Member has in mind, we
                look forward to it. The other possibility is a tax similar to
                the council tax that exists across the water. Other taxes may be
                introduced, but all possibilities must be considered within the
                limits of what the Assembly can do. We may consider the
                introduction of new local taxes, but income tax is a reserved
                matter, and the Member’s party’s suggestion of changing it
                would have to be dealt with elsewhere.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The strategic investment body is intended to
                centralise expertise and the capacity for managing assets,
                raising funds and dealing with infrastructure investment
                matters. The Deputy First Minister said that limited capacity
                for those matters, and a certain degree of expertise, is
                currently scattered across 10 or 11 Departments. It is more
                efficient to centralise and develop the capacity and expertise
                through a single body that can coherently study the whole range
                of public sector investment and the management of public assets.
                That will be done within the Administration, and it will be
                appropriate, therefore, to bring together people from within it
                who represent it as a whole.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is why it was an obvious first step to
                turn to the parties that participate in the Administration. To
                go beyond that and look to other Assembly parties that do not
                participate in the Administration would run counter to the
                thrust of the initiative, which is that the body will operate
                within the Administration to enable the most efficient asset
                management.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have taken a decision in principle to
                establish a strategic investment body, and we will work out the
                detail as quickly as we can. We will be happy to share our
                decisions with the Assembly as we go through the process. It is
                a new concept, although the idea has surfaced in other
                jurisdictions. Quite a few people in government are moving
                towards it because of the desirability of ensuring that the
                public administration’s assets and capacity to raise finance
                are used in an efficient and effective way.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will make my question brief. The Deputy
                First Minister intimated that there might be other sites,
                referring to security bases that are going to be closed down,
                and said that when other sites became available, they would
                utilise those also. Does he have any particular sites in mind
                that he would like to tell the Assembly about?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I did not say that as other sites became
                available, we would utilise them also. What I did say was that
                as other sites became available, it would fall to the Executive
                to consider whether we wanted to intervene on the strategic use
                of those sites. In saying that, I was not implying that
                additional sites would come free of charge. Many Members
                anticipated that we were going to have to pay for the Ebrington
                site, for example. They said that it would be a good site to
                buy, and a good use of our budget. We have got it free of
                charge. In relation to other sites, we might have to decide
                whether to purchase them — that is the arrangement and the
                understanding that existed prior to this package.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have done well to get these sites free,
                and we must make the best use of them. We must all consider
                responsibly what to do in relation to future sites. I would like
                to think that we could persuade the Treasury to give us future
                sites free of charge, and our ability to do that might be
                related to whether we do anything with the rest of this package
                — that is, the strategic reforms that we are talking about and
                our approach to revenue issues.</p>

  (Northern Ireland) (Amendment) 2002.</p>
  </font><font SIZE="3">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Secretary of State wrote to the Speaker on 26 April
  2002 formally referring draft amendment Regulations to the Flags Regulations
  (Northern Ireland) 2000, as required under the Flags (Northern Ireland) Order
  2000. Article 4(2) of the Flags (Northern Ireland) Order 2000 says that</p>
  </font><font SIZE="1">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Assembly shall, within such period as the
  Secretary of State may specify, report to the Secretary of State the views
  expressed in the Assembly on the proposed regulations.&quot;</p>
  </font><font SIZE="3">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On this occasion, the Secretary of State has specified the
  period until 8 May for a response.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Normally, a business motion would be tabled by a member of
  the Business Committee requesting that an Ad Hoc Committee be set up to
  consider the matter and report to the Assembly. Given the extremely tight
  deadline set by the Secretary of State, the Business Committee agreed on 29
  April that the only viable way of getting the Assembly’s view on the
  proposed amendments was by way of a debate, and this motion fulfils that
  purpose. The Speaker will write to the Secretary of State, attaching a copy of
  Hansard, to inform him of the Assembly’s views.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Secretary of State has advised that the amendments are
  minor and bring about no change in the principle that underlies the
  legislation. The amendments have two main purposes. First, following the
  deaths of The Princess Margaret and Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth The Queen
  Mother, it is sadly necessary to make an amendment to remove the requirement
  to fly the flag on official buildings to celebrate their birthdays in the
  future.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, the legislation was originally drafted to ensure
  that flag flying in Northern Ireland replicated the policy on flags elsewhere
  in the United Kingdom. To celebrate the Golden Jubilee of Her Majesty, it has
  recently been decided that flags will be widely flown from official buildings.
  Consistent with the original approach, the Secretary of State intends to add
  the Jubilee weekend at the beginning of June to the list contained in part II
  of the schedule to the Regulations for this year only, so that flags will be
  flown in Northern Ireland from the official buildings covered by the
  Regulations. The Secretary of State has apologised for the short notice, but
  the proximity of the Jubilee weekend makes the matter quite pressing. After
  consideration by the Assembly today, the Regulations will go to Parliament.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Wearing my party hat, the DUP’s position on flag flying
  is well known — flags should fly when the Assembly is sitting. The DUP will
  try to find days to compensate for the loss of these two days.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Davis:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support what Mr Morrow has said. It is unfortunate that
  we have to deal with this because of the deaths of The Princess Margaret and
  Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. However, in contrast to those
  sad occasions, we are also celebrating the year of the Golden Jubilee, in
  which we can look back and be grateful for the reign of Her Majesty The Queen.
  It is important that we in Northern Ireland are consistent with the rest of
  the United Kingdom in flying the flag of our country throughout the Queen’s
  Golden Jubilee celebrations.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that we will not see the controversy which usually
  follows the flags issue, but rather that people will have respect for those
  who hold the monarchy dear to their hearts. Parity of esteem does not impact
  on just one community in Northern Ireland; it should apply equally to all
  communities.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Union flag represents the broad and natural
  constituency of the British Isles. It is not — or should not be — a flag
  of hate for some people, used for sectarian or tribal purposes. It should be a
  flag for all people, symbolic of the importance of democracy and the fact that
  we live in a multicultural British society. The sooner that opponents of
  Britain and all things British realise that, the sooner we will begin to
  achieve a mature and stable society in Northern Ireland.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr C Murphy:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Mr Morrow
  outlined why it is necessary to have a debate, rather than an Ad Hoc
  Committee, on these amendments. A debate on the amendments to the Flags
  Regulations is a side issue. The real issue is that the Secretary of State
  continues to abuse a power that was originally devolved to the Assembly and
  that was seized from it by his predecessor, Peter Mandelson, at the behest of
  the Ulster Unionist Party.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The negotiations that led to the Good Friday Agreement
  recognised that the issue of flags and emblems was sensitive and problematic,
  and needed to be dealt with in a way that reflected the new political
  dispensation, rather than the dominance of one community over the other, which
  was the hallmark of previous Administrations here.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The guidelines for dealing with flags and emblems are set
  out in the rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity section of the
  agreement:</p>
  </font><font SIZE="1">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;All participants acknowledge the sensitivity of the
  use of symbols and emblems for public purposes, and the need in particular in
  creating the new institutions to ensure such symbols and emblems are used in a
  manner which promotes mutual respect rather than division.&quot;</p>
  </font><font SIZE="3">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The task of agreeing a policy on flags and emblems was
  rightly given to the Executive, who duly set up a subcommittee to consider the
  issue. However, unknown to the other parties in the Executive, the Ulster
  Unionist Party had already reached a private agreement with Peter Mandelson
  that its position on flags would be enforced in the event that no agreement
  was concluded by the Executive.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The existence of that private deal was not only a
  disincentive for the Executive to reach agreement on the issue, but an
  incentive for the Ulster Unionist Party not to reach an agreement with its
  Executive Colleagues, as its position was already guaranteed by the Secretary
  of State. It is not surprising that the Executive subcommittee did not agree a
  policy.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, despite the fact that the Executive did not come
  to a conclusion on the issue, as correspondence from the then Deputy First
  Minister revealed, the Secretary of State acted on his private commitment to
  the Ulster Unionist Party and unilaterally removed the power to decide on this
  issue from the Assembly. In doing so he usurped the power of locally elected
  Ministers over their own departmental headquarters on what are termed
  &quot;designated flying days&quot; and produced a set of Regulations that flew
  in the face of the agreement that his Government had signed up to. Arguably,
  his Regulations also contravened the Fair Employment Code of Practice, which
  states that</p>
  </font><font SIZE="1">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Employees do not have to tolerate reminders or
  suggestions that particular religious beliefs or political opinions have a
  special place in their workplace.&quot;</p>
  </font><font SIZE="3">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Féin and other parties objected to the Regulations
  when they were submitted to the Assembly. The former went on to challenge the
  authority of the Secretary of State to arbitrarily remove powers from the
  Assembly at the whim of a single political party.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The current Secretary of State should recognise that the
  power to set policy on this issue should rest with the democratically elected
  representatives of the Assembly. Rather than giving us minimal notice on the
  proposed removal or addition of a couple of &quot;designated flying
  days&quot;, he should legislate for the return of those powers, so that a
  policy for the use of flags and emblems for public purposes can be agreed by
  ourselves in a manner consistent with the agreement that the vast majority of
  Members have signed up to. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs E Bell:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Alliance Party supports the amendment of the Flags
  Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2000. I hope that the amendment will
  rationalise the situation, so that during the Jubilee weekend this year the
  Union flag will be flown with dignity and as a sign of respect to The Queen,
  and not be left to fly until it is in tatters, with neither respect nor
  dignity. I also hope — perhaps in vain — that local politics will not
  besmirch that event.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is encouraging that other organisations have advised the
  flying of the Union flag only on a time-restricted basis. I hope that the
  whole question of flags and emblems can be agreed as quickly and as
  sensitively as possible, although again I suppose that that hope is in vain.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once again, we extend our sympathy to the Royal Family on
  the deaths of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother and The Princess
  Margaret. However, we support the amendment.</p>
  <i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.15 pm</p>
  </i><b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a take-note motion, because, at the time of
  devolution, that settlement provided that matters relating to the Crown,
  including the flying of the national flag — the Union flag — would remain
  at Westminster. On that basis, I disagree with Conor Murphy. The powers to
  regulate the flying of the national flag never properly lay with the Assembly
  in the first place. Therefore, there was no surreptitious snatching-away of
  that power through a back-door deal.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr C Murphy:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Member explain why it was necessary for the
  previous Secretary of State, by Order in Council, to take back from the
  Assembly the power to regulate the flying of flags, if that power never rested
  with the Assembly in the first place?</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The point is that there was no previous legislation; that
  is why it had to be established. It is clearly set out in the devolution
  settlement that matters relating to the Crown, including the flying of the
  Union flag, would not be devolved and would rest with Westminster.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Furthermore, Conor Murphy misinterprets page 20, paragraph
  5 of the Belfast Agreement where it refers to symbols and emblems. The
  national flag, according to good legal interpretation, does not fall into
  those categories. The Flags Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2000 were subject
  to consultation by the Secretary of State with the Ad Hoc Committee of the
  Assembly. At that time and since, the Ulster Unionist Party has welcomed those
  Regulations, because, for the first time in the existence of the Northern
  Ireland state, they put the official flying of the national flag on a
  legislative footing, which it never had throughout the previous period of
  devolution between 1922 and 1972. It also establishes a degree of
  comparability between official practice by Departments here and their
  counterparts elsewhere in the United Kingdom.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft amendments, with which the motion is most
  directly concerned, have been made necessary by the recent sad deaths in the
  Royal Family, and on a more positive note, by this year’s Golden Jubilee. I
  support the motion, as it continues the practice established by the Flags
  Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2000 of properly regulated and, therefore,
  dignified flying of the national flag. That contrasts markedly with the mass
  of varied flags put up on all too many lamp posts.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Foster:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. I am not a flag flaunter. Flaunting
  demeans the flag; it belittles its dignity and what it stands for. Those who
  wave the flag in a taunting and provocative fashion are often the first to
  waive what it stands for.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having said that, I find it most provocative and offensive
  that this state’s flag is not allowed to be flown from council buildings
  where Sinn Féin are in control. That is happening in Fermanagh District
  Council, where an attempt has been made to remove any hue of Britishness from
  the council buildings. Even a plaque in honour of Captain Oates of the famed
  Antarctic expedition has been removed. Sinn Féin says that it is &quot;a
  neutral environment&quot;. I say that such actions do not create a neutral
  environment. Rather, for thousands of others and myself, they create an
  environment which is hostile, highly insulting and grossly offensive.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The national flag — in this instance, the Union flag —
  should be flown from all Government and local government buildings in Northern
  Ireland on, at least, designated days. If we have all acknowledged the Belfast
  Agreement, which states that we are part of the United Kingdom of Great
  Britain and Northern Ireland so long as the majority of the electorate
  indicate that that is their wish, there should be no problem with the flying
  of the national flag.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue must be resolved soon, because we cannot remain
  in limbo, demeaning this state’s flag of sovereignty and almost apologising
  for flying it. Any objection to the sovereignty of Her Majesty and her flag is
  inconsistent with the fact that everyone accepts coins that bear an image of
  the Queen’s head.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Belfast Agreement confirms that there is only one
  sovereignty here, and those who wish to cherry-pick cannot ignore that point.
  I support the motion.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SDLP recognises that this take-note debate relates to
  the broad issue of flags and emblems, not just the specific recommendations of
  the motion. The SDLP wishes to be careful when debating the matter, and point
  scoring has been taking place, so we waited until the end of the debate to
  comment.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the Ad Hoc Committee failed, after considerable
  work, to reach consensus on the flags issue, it produced a report. If the
  Secretary of State requires information on, and evidence of, the SDLP’s
  position, I refer him to the party’s lengthy submission in that report, in
  which the SDLP advocates that the issue of the display of flags should be kept
  under periodic review. That is consistent with, and a requirement of, the Good
  Friday Agreement. A more consensual approach to the display of flags on
  Government buildings may emerge in time, and a periodic review of the matter
  may create some impetus. I hope that everyone aspires to that position. In
  addition, the SDLP submitted that the application of the proposed Regulations
  should be time-limited to one year only in the first instance. We look forward
  to development that creates progress for everyone without resulting in
  confrontation. Each time the issue is considered, party political point
  scoring takes place.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Morrow:</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have listened carefully to all the contributions, and,

  Féin should use the opportunity to carry out a divisive political stunt —
  that will not go unnoticed. I take the point that when Sinn Féin has been in
  control, it has quickly demonstrated its intolerance for anyone with a
  differing opinion, which is regrettable. I wish to say nothing more, because I
  recognise that most of the comments were constructive and were made in the
  spirit of the motion.</p>

  the opportunity to speak on this fundamental motion. No one in the House or
  outside could argue that we in the Assembly have not created many
  opportunities to debate the Good Friday Agreement. It was in that spirit that
  I introduced the motion.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is sad that the UUP has had to put forward an amendment.
  I have no problem in talking about policing, if that is what it wants to
  debate. However, the purpose of the motion is to focus on the fundamental
  principles of the Good Friday Agreement and to bring forward and query the
  reasons why we are not using the Chamber to debate and exchange views on that
  subject.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our society has emerged from conflict lasting more than 30
  years, against the background of a previous 50 years of division. We must find
  ways, means, mechanisms and debates for resolving that conflict. We only have
  to look at the Middle East to see how conflict returns when a peace process
  goes wrong. There is a huge onus on all of us to never allow that to happen.</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Doherty:</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we are to follow through on inclusion and equality,
  there should be no reason why we cannot have thoroughgoing debate on the
  concepts contained in the Good Friday Agreement. At Weston Park we were
  promised an implementation group, which would allow that debate, yet it has
  met only once. No one can deny that, and we have had no regular exchange of
  views. Unionists must ask themselves why they do not want to debate those
  issues in the Chamber.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">DUP Members are afraid of their shadows, but what are the
  Ulster Unionist Members afraid of?Surely nothing in the Good Friday Agreement
  would cause them concern. Plenty in it would concern the DUP, because it
  favours inequality and the divisions that caused mayhem for previous
  generations. Why is the UUP so reluctant to debate the fundamental elements of
  the Good Friday Agreement? Let us debate the issue.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. Did Pat Doherty
  not request that only 60 minutes be allocated to the debate?</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Madam Deputy Speaker:</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Doherty:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is not true. Dr Paisley would be better off attending
  his other duties today, rather than raising false points in the House.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Féin is committed to the terms of the Good Friday
  Agreement, to equality, inclusion and dialogue with Unionists to find ways to
  overcome any outstanding issues that they feel must be addressed. If Unionists
  want to address policing, let us consider that although the Good Friday
  Agreement promised a new beginning for policing, we have not had that. The
  Patten Commission’s recommendations were decimated by Peter Mandelson’s
  Bill in Westminster. The British Government promised that they would introduce
  new legislation, but we have seen no sign of that. Sinn Féin is not afraid to
  debate policing, but I am concerned by the Unionists’ reluctance to debate
  the fundamental components of the Good Friday Agreement. What aspects of
  equality and inclusiveness are they afraid of?</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Madam Deputy Speaker:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One amendment is published on the Marshalled List.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I beg to move the following amendment, standing in my name
  and those of Mr Nesbitt, Mr Cobain and Mr McFarland: Delete all after
  &quot;Assembly&quot; and insert:</p>
  </font><font SIZE="1">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;endorses the Belfast Agreement with its promise of a
  new beginning based on exclusively peaceful and democratic means and
  accordingly calls on all parties to support the police in the present
  difficult circumstances.&quot;</p>
  </font><font SIZE="3">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Pat Doherty said that he was sad that the amendment was
  tabled. Although he referred in his motion to supporting the principles of the
  Good Friday Agreement — or the Belfast Agreement, as it is properly called
  — he did not say that he supported the agreement itself. That relates to the
  fact that around four years ago Sinn Féin debated whether it supported the
  agreement, but we are still waiting to hear whether it does. Pat Doherty
  supports the principles of the agreement, but only selectively. The motion is
  not an explicit endorsement of the agreement. It is dishonest and a sleight of
  hand to talk about supporting the principles without supporting the agreement.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although Mr Doherty said little that allowed Members to get
  their teeth into the substance of his argument, he is well aware that Sinn
  Féin and Republicans have walked away at every opportunity from a key part of
  the agreement: the right of the people of Northern Ireland to determine their
  constitutional future. That implies that the inhabitants of the island of
  Ireland do not form a nation in the political sense and that they have no
  right to national self-government, no right to unity of the national territory
  and, above all, no right to national self-determination. Those are key
  elements.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another key element of the agreement is the support for
  exclusively peaceful and democratic means, without the use, or the threat, of
  force. That is a stark paradox, given the tenets of last week’s debate in
  which Members discussed the situation in Colombia and the investigation into
  the &quot;Bogotá three&quot; by the Committee on International Relations in
  the United States House of Representatives, chaired by Henry Hyde. That
  Committee’s evidence stated that two of the Irish nationals being held in
  Colombia were the IRA’s leading explosives experts and that another was Sinn
  Féin’s representative in Cuba, who was probably funded by the Cuban
  Government. It seems to me that those events contradict the principles of the
  Belfast Agreement.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We reflect on the report that those found guilty of
  gunrunning in Miami have been endorsed as IRA prisoners of war. We also
  reflect on the situation in north Belfast. A Sinn Féin councillor in north
  Belfast blames everything on the UDA, no matter what happens — whether it
  rains, or whether there is violence. However, Republicans have a strong case
  to answer regarding the orchestration of violence in that area, particularly
  in relation to the argument that in Ardoyne — where Loyalists represent 20%,
  and Nationalists 80%, of the population — Loyalists are constantly picking
  on the overwhelming majority in that area.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That contradicts the efforts that Mr Pat Doherty made to
  convince the House that he endorses and supports the principles of the
  agreement. There is a long way to go before the Assembly can accept what Mr
  Pat Doherty claims to represent, and agree with his view that Sinn Féin and
  Republicans are fully behind the agreement. There are strong suggestions that
  Sinn Féin is often far from happy with the agreement and with what we all
  consider to be its principles — the commitment to exclusively peaceful
  means, democracy, and non-violence.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ceasefires are about more than simply an absence of
  so-called military activity. Everybody in Northern Ireland who signed up to
  the agreement and the peace process believes in an exclusively peaceful and
  democratic society. That means a complete absence of violence. What those
  associates of Sinn Féin orchestrate is far from that. However, they are not
  alone in the &quot;paramilitary constituency&quot; — if I can call it that.
  There are movements towards violence throughout that &quot;constituency&quot;.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Féin and Mr Pat Doherty are hypocrites who talk about
  Unionists being frightened of the debate and of not being prepared to take
  part in it. We had this debate many years ago. As far as I am concerned, it is
  over. The agreement was endorsed by an overwhelming majority of the people of
  Northern Ireland. We move on from that. We are all in the House working the
  process, no matter what we say.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The bottom line is that Sinn Féin and Republicanism are
  the main threat to the Executive, the Assembly and the entire process. They
  must do better than simply point the finger at something they claim Unionists
  are frightened of. Unionists are not frightened of the process. We know
  exactly where we are going, what our targets are and what our strategy is in
  this. We will continue to pursue that strategy. Sinn Féin and Republicans are
  currently the biggest threat to the process.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Attwood:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a fundamental flaw in the debate and in the
  contributions so far. Sinn Féin talks about how others dishonour the
  principles and substance of the Good Friday Agreement, but not about how it
  might be doing the same. Likewise, Unionists talk about how others dishonour
  the substance and details of the Good Friday Agreement, but do not talk of
  themselves.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is the fault line in this debate. In talking about how
  the Good Friday Agreement is being honoured and dishonoured, it is incumbent
  upon each party to talk about how each party is honouring and dishonouring the
  spirit and substance of the Good Friday Agreement, and not simply to point the
  finger at other parties in the Chamber.</p>
  <i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.45 pm</p>
  </i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome Pat Doherty’s belated commitment to the
  implementation group. The SDLP, along with other parties, argued for an
  implementation group. The SDLP argued for it and secured it at the Weston Park
  negotiations. I welcome the belated enthusiasm of Sinn Féin for this key
  mechanism of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the implementation group will meet soon, and
  regularly, to discuss all aspects of the agreement, not least policing. Pat
  Doherty said that he wants to discuss policing. I look forward to that debate
  and to his realising that, rather than nobbling the powers of the Police
  Ombudsman, as he recently alleged it did, the Policing Board endorsed the
  Police Ombudsman as a result of its actions after the Omagh report.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I look forward to the debate with Pat Doherty, so that he
  can recognise that when the Policing Board agreed a new symbol for the Police
  Service it did not include the British Crown but symbols that reflect the
  diversity and traditions on this island. I look forward to that debate with
  Pat Doherty, so that, rather than having a slogan about the disbandment of
  Special Branch, we can discuss a strategy to deconstruct and reconstruct
  Special Branch in an open and transparent way.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I look forward to meeting Pat Doherty at the implementation
  group where we can show how the Policing Board and the SDLP are getting
  policing right, and Sinn Féin can show why it still says that policing is
  wrong. I look forward to telling him how the Policing Board is facing up to
  its responsibilities on behalf of the citizens in the North, unlike Sinn Féin,
  which shirks those responsibilities. I suggest to Pat Doherty that it is past
  the time that Sinn Féin should recognise the policing challenge. Having
  missed the boat, his party should get in a dinghy and start rowing.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also look forward to debate with the Ulster Unionist
  Party at the implementation group and to its explaining to the people of the
  North and the parties in the Chamber how it is honouring the agreement when it
  insults the citizens of the Republic of Ireland, as its leader did some weeks
  ago. I look forward to the Ulster Unionist Party’s explaining to the people
  of the North and the parties in the Chamber how parity of esteem is being
  recognised — <i>[Interruption].</p>

  of Northern Ireland. The Union flag is banned from Government buildings for
  most of the year. Security installations have been removed, on-the-run
  terrorists have been pardoned, and there has been discrimination against
  victims in funding. There has been no substantial and credible IRA
  decommissioning.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Attwood spoke of what he got at Weston Park. However,
  there was one thing he did not get, as his leader said. Officials of the
  United Kingdom said &quot;You have no guns; therefore, you cannot get what you
  desire.&quot; That is the very cradle of the matter that we deal with today.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad to have had the opportunity today to table a
  motion that will give the House the opportunity that the deputy leader of the
  IRA here shouted about — an opportunity really to discuss the police in
  Northern Ireland. The Official Unionists’ amendment could not be more
  hypocritical. It mentions endorsing the Belfast Agreement. The majority of
  Unionists in Northern Ireland do not endorse it. Furthermore, it calls on
  parties to support the police. The police have been destroyed by the
  agreement. The hatchet of Republicanism now hangs over the heads of the
  Special Branch and the full-time Reserve. The opportunity will shortly be
  given to the House to have a real debate. We will not ask for an hour. Let us
  have a full debate, in which every man elected to the Assembly can give a full
  answer to the question of where he stands.<i> [Interruption].</p>
  </i><b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Madam Deputy Speaker:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The time has come for the House to face up to the fact that
  the majority of the Unionist population is opposed to the agreement and does
  not want it. Until that is recognised and there is a fair election for the
  people of Ulster to decide the issue, we can only move forward to more of the
  underhand violence and murder orchestrated, as it is in north Belfast, by
  IRA/Sinn Féin.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Four years on from the signing of the Belfast Agreement,
  the Good Friday Agreement, or whatever we call it, it is rather sad that today’s
  motion looks merely at its principles. I had hoped that we would be looking
  more at the practice — the collective ability of this institution and others
  to bring to fruition all that we expected to see, and ensuring that the
  agreement works for the good of all the people of Northern Ireland. However,
  the fact that the motion returns to the issue of principles, rather than the
  practice of four years’ experience, suggests that the agreement was the
  ceiling of some people’s ambitions. It suggests that once agreement was
  reached, people could scurry back to their corner to look after their
  self-interests, rather than its being the foundation on which we could build a
  united community and move from the notion of managing a divided society.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All parties have obligations under the agreement — few
  parties have lived up to all of them. Therefore, we should not debate support
  for the principles of the agreement only. We should consider how the Assembly,
  and the other institutions of the agreement, should work to bring it to
  fruition.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There have been countless examples of failure to implement
  the agreement on the part of all who worked on it. The establishment of the
  institutions has been too slow. We have failed to establish a proper
  legislative programme here. We have hardly had a single meeting of the
  British-Irish Council. Decommissioning has been slow, but at least there have
  been two recent episodes of Republican decommissioning — there has been none
  by Loyalists. I fail to see how we can suggest that it is a matter of
  discussing principles rather than practice.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Doherty referred to the amendment. He suggested that the
  Bill that Peter Mandelson introduced in Westminster had decimated the Patten
  Report. That is an erroneous interpretation, and it is noticeable that Sinn
  Féin has produced little other than niggling examples of how it fails to
  seize the opportunity in relation to policing. Sinn Féin appears to be
  scrabbling for every excuse possible to avoid taking its places on the
  Policing Board — and, presumably, on the local district partnerships, when
  they are established later this year.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Police Service of Northern Ireland is fully built on
  the principles of Patten and, in almost every respect, on the fine detail of
  Patten. It should be seen by all that it is capable of working for all, and it
  should be supported by all. The PSNI is working for the good of the entire
  community. It is not, as some would have alleged in the past, representative
  of one group only.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amendment deserves support because it gives a more
  balanced picture than the motion does. I noticed with some amusement that when
  Mr McGimpsey said that Republicans were the biggest threat to the agreement he
  faced no disagreement from the DUP. I thought that the DUP hoped that it was
  the biggest threat to the agreement, but it is clear that it is comfortable
  working in the Assembly and the other institutions in which it participates. [<i>Interruption</i>].</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Madam Deputy Speaker:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have no doubt that the DUP will continue to be
  comfortable in doing so. [<i>Interruption</i>].</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Madam Deputy Speaker:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The threats to the institutions do not come from those who
  proclaim their opposition to the agreement, but from those who reached the
  agreement four years ago only to spend all their time, on whatever side they
  are, running back to their own tribes and ignoring the needs of the wider
  community. The Assembly must move away from those party games. We should
  support the amendment. We should then cease to discuss such issues and
  implement the agreement.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Roche:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The principles of the agreement fall into two categories.
  They are those that legitimise terrorism and those, contrary to Mr McGimpsey’s
  opinion, that legitimise Irish Nationalism and undermine the legitimacy of the
  Union. That latter set of principles has never been the subject of proper
  public debate.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The agreement legitimises terrorism by placing the
  representatives of terror in the Government of Northern Ireland without any
  requirement for the IRA to decommission. The principle there is that Northern
  Ireland’s citizens should be governed by those who terrorised them for 30
  years. That principle is an affront to democracy and common decency.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The agreement also legitimises terrorism by releasing
  terrorist prisoners. In order to be released, a person must be convicted of a
  terrorist crime and be a member of an organisation that is on ceasefire. Again
  contrary to Mr McGimpsey’s opinion, the courts have ruled that that
  ceasefire cannot be broken by either murder or gunrunning. Dr Reid recently
  ruled that a ceasefire cannot be broken by engagement in the development of
  the technology of terror at the heart of international terrorism. Therefore, a
  ceasefire that cannot be broken under those circumstances is no ceasefire at
  all.</p>
  <i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.00 pm</p>
  </i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The idea that people who have committed appalling
  crimes should be released from prison because they have committed those crimes
  and because they are members of an organisation that directed that sort of
  criminality is a legalised corruption of the rule of law that is without
  precedent in any democratic or civilised state. When you reach the position of
  legitimising terrorism to the extent of putting the representatives of terror
  into Government and letting terrorists out of jail, what you have actually
  done is that, on one hand, you may concede that the terrorist organisation
  actually committed some horrendous acts, but what you are really saying is
  that that organisation cannot be held culpable — cannot be held blameworthy
  — for committing those acts.&quot;</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That raises a fundamental question about the core nature of
  the Belfast Agreement. Where is culpability mentioned in the terms of the
  Belfast Agreement? The amazing, indisputable answer is that the ultimate
  culpability for what the Patten Report referred to as &quot;the tragedies of
  the past&quot; lies not with those who perpetrated those appalling criminal
  acts but with the legitimate forces of law and order that stood between the
  terrorist and the citizen. According to the remit given by the Belfast
  Agreement to Patten, the ultimate culpability lies with the RUC. For example,
  the Patten Report stated that the RUC is</p>
  </font><font SIZE="1">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;at the heart of many of the problems that politicians
  have been unable to resolve in Northern Ireland&quot;.</p>
  </font><font SIZE="3">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That clearly states that somehow the culpability lies with
  the RUC. At the core of the report is the statement that we must</p>
  </font><font SIZE="1">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;reorient policing in Northern Ireland onto an
  approach based on upholding human rights and respecting human dignity&quot;.</p>
  </font><font SIZE="3">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not need to take time to spell out the core
  implication there. Having made the RUC culpable, the report proceeded to lay
  the foundation for a new so-called police force that would integrate
  terrorists into the heart of policing. Patten argued that without the
  recruitment of Republicans — not just Nationalists — the new police force
  could not operate effectively. Terrorists are elevated by the agreement into
  Government and into policing those citizens whom they terrorised for 30 years.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Where did those ideas come from? I do not have the time to
  elaborate, but the fountainhead of the legitimisation of terror can be found
  in the Mitchell principles. A key factor about those principles is that they
  have nothing to do with decommissioning. This went undetected by the media,
  who can hardly read a report. Decommissioning is not required, but those
  principles require a political settlement that would take the gun out of
  politics. When one argues for a political settlement to take the gun out of
  politics, one has elevated the terrorists to arbiters of the content and
  implementation of what is required to remove the gun.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From where did this Mr Mitchell, who should have been
  chased out of this country, get all of that? He got it from the Sinn Féin
  submission to the Mitchell Commission, because taking the gun out of Irish
  politics by an agreement is central to that party’s terminology. Therefore,
  Mr Mitchell elevated terrorism and its legitimisation into the Belfast
  Agreement. Nobody can support that agreement.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Madam Deputy Speaker:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order, order. The Member’s time is up.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is rather sad that just after a debate on the future
  economic confidence of this country, we have a debate on our lack of political
  confidence.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The agreement should not be used in the Chamber or anywhere
  else in Northern Ireland to shame the other side. I have said repeatedly that
  nobody has a monopoly on the agreement. Listening to some of the debate,
  including Mr Roche’s contribution, one could almost forget some of our
  achievements on constitutional questions. The agreement accepts that the
  constitutional future of Northern Ireland will be determined by the will of
  its people. That principle is important to the agreement. Most, if not all, of
  us agree with that major principle. I would like to be shown the person who
  does not agree with that principle.</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Big deal.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I find it amazing that we hear the words &quot;big
  deal&quot; from those on the anti-agreement side of the House. It was a big
  deal when we were in negotiations —<i>[Interruption].</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Madam Deputy Speaker:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The removal of articles 2 and 3 was a big deal during the
  negotiations.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a devolved Administration at Stormont, which
  Members around the Chamber are involved in, or they would not be here. The
  British-Irish Council was established, and it was recognised that all
  aspirations and identities carry equal legitimacy. Power sharing was
  introduced, and a commitment was made to democracy and peaceful means of
  change. The list goes on and on. We once had such confidence in the agreement.
  What can we do to re-establish that?</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad that Alex Attwood said that the negotiations in
  Weston Park resulted in a round table meeting of the pro-agreement parties.
  They have met only once, and the meeting may as well not have happened; it was
  so good that I am beginning to believe that the Secretary of State has decided
  that that was all that was needed. That is not how we implement agreements. We
  must continue to restore people’s best intentions, rather than reinforce
  their worst fears, which is all that we are hearing today. Let us give some
  life back to these institutions.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will support the Ulster Unionist Party’s amendment
  because we have gone a long way towards restoring confidence and establishing
  the kind of police service in which Northern Ireland can have confidence — <i>[Interruption].</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Madam Deputy Speaker:</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr:</p>

  Deputy Speaker, because she is addressing comments directly to another Member.
  You are showing favouritism.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased that I did not score party political points
  when Dr Paisley referred to the ability of only the men in the Chamber to
  participate in the debate. I decided to let that remark go, but given that
  that side of the House has turned into a playground, it is important to say
  that I — and I assume all parties — will be glad to participate in a
  debate on policing.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we have forgotten the principles to which we signed up,
  it is time that the implementation committee restored some confidence in the
  process to the people who watch debate after debate and wonder what has
  happened. Patience and perseverance are required, not fatigue and failure,
  which are all that that side of the House ever promises.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When is a document not an agreement? It is not an agreement
  when all the parties to it do not subscribe to any of its contents. Any fool
  would realise that the parties agreed little or nothing of what is alleged to
  be the subject of this document. There was no meeting of minds, which is
  essential to any agreement. In ‘The Daily Telegraph’, the First Minister
  said that the implementation process was not implementing the agreement that
  he thought he had signed. If the leader of that party is not sure about what
  he signed, we can be fairly confident that no one else is.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The consent of the people in a referendum to the approval
  of this document was induced by a wave of propaganda that would have done
  justice to Joseph Goebbels. It was also induced by the lying, mendacious,
  duplicitous behaviour of a Prime Minister — one Anthony Blair. He told the
  people of Northern Ireland, in his own handwriting, what those pledges were
  and has resiled and reneged on every single one of them.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This alleged agreement was never intended to be an
  agreement or political settlement between democrats. It was never more than a
  schedule or scheme for conflict resolution between the British state and
  violent Republicanism. In order to keep the bombs off the mainland, the
  British Government were prepared to enter into an agreement. <i>[Interruption].</p>
  </i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes, the only man in cloud cuckoo land is the First
  Minister — the king of cuckoos. And what did Mr Trimble do? So greedy was he
  to become the First Minister, that he entered into an agreement without any
  provision for making good the deficit in infrastructure of the previous 30
  years. He did not even have the wit to say to the British Government, which
  was absolutely hanging its tongue out to get rid of Northern Ireland to a
  devolved Administration: &quot;Here is our price&quot;. Instead, he and Mr
  Empey have engaged in a brazen con over the last few days. They are going to
  get £5 billion on loan and, over 25 years, repay £10 billion. At the same
  time they are spending £1·2 billion out of the grant on an absolute welter
  of bureaucracy, which they have done absolutely nothing to reduce in the last
  two and a half years.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then, of course, we have Sinn Féin/IRA and their partners
  in harness, the SDLP. We have Monica McWilliams talking about the great
  principle of consent. The Unionist people have been given consent to pass the
  legal title deeds of Northern Ireland over to the Republic of Ireland, when,
  in fact, it has already got, de facto, an actual possession of the place. As
  for her suggestion of the great amendment of articles 2 and 3, whatever else
  she is and whatever expertise she has, it is certainly not that of a lawyer. <i>[Interruption].</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also have the gunrunners, the non-police people, the
  trainers of terrorists — the people who have really decommissioned nothing,
  though the king of cuckoos now tells us they have done it twice. If he can get
  the people of Northern Ireland to believe that, he can get them to believe
  anything.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The truth is that, increasingly, pro-Union all classes,
  even the middle-class yuppies, are beginning to get the message that this
  agreement has totally shafted them — in education, health, sewerage, water
  and every conceivable aspect. More accountable, more sensitive, more efficient
  government for Northern Ireland — that must be the biggest joke of the
  century, perpetrated by the cuckoo king.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Maskey:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I want to make
  a few points. Some comments were made earlier about the time available for
  this debate. All Members will be aware that it is open to any Member or party
  to propose a motion to the Business Committee and to argue for whatever time
  they want for it. It was noticeable that at this afternoon’s meeting of the
  Business Committee the DUP sat quietly and did not propose anything for next
  week. In fact, we have only one plenary sitting next week. Tuesday was
  available, and if the DUP had wanted to put forward any proposal for debate,
  it was free to do so. Either it was not prepared, or it was not able or not
  interested. Then DUP Members come into the Chamber and make noise about
  wanting longer debates, yet they sit on their hands at the Business Committee.</p>
  <i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.15 pm</p>
  </i><b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, you will be able to inform the House
  that the motion has only just been tabled and therefore could not be debated
  next week.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further to that point of order, is it in order for the
  Member for West Belfast to tell tales outside the Business Committee? The
  proceedings of the Business Committee are supposed to be held entirely in
  confidence. It is improper for a Member to divulge discussions held at those
  meetings.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Madam Deputy Speaker:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. It is quite correct that the proceedings of the
  Business Committee are confidential, but the minutes are published on the
  Internet.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Maskey:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am happy to have my knuckles rapped. The essential point
  remains <i>— [Interruption].</p>
  </i><b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Madam Deputy Speaker:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Maskey:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The essential point remains that next week we will have one
  plenary meeting. That left another day for any of ten or twelve pages of
  no-day named motions, which could have been tabled by the DUP or any other
  Member. They chose not to do so.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion and oppose the UUP’s amendment. This
  motion is essentially aimed at the Ulster Unionist Party — there is no
  question of trying to convince the DUP and its cohorts on the Benches
  opposite. They are entitled to their opinion, but they are avowedly
  anti-agreement and wait with bated breath until it collapses. That is their
  choice, and they are entitled to that.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the Ulster Unionist Party is supposed to be a
  pro-agreement party. I am disappointed with Michael McGimpsey, a Minister in
  the Executive who should be more responsible. I will stand corrected, but I
  think he said that Sinn Féin never really endorsed the Good Friday Agreement.
  Michael McGimpsey should know that we negotiated the agreement, went away and
  considered it, embraced it and then went to our constituencies and sold it. We
  have been working hard on its implementation ever since.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Without giving a litany of examples, the Ulster Unionist
  Party, in ongoing negotiations here and in the British Parliament itself, has
  sought to restrict, minimise and subvert every element of legislation that
  emanated from the agreement. The Ulster Unionist Party is formally a
  pro-agreement party, but it has worked hard and assiduously to undermine it.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would prefer to have a discussion on the Good Friday
  Agreement and its principles. As David Ford said earlier, it is important to
  go back to the principles of the agreement. There have been many failures and
  fault lines in its implementation during the last four years. Whether it is
  through an implementation body meeting or any other forum, we all welcome the
  opportunity to ensure that the agreement is implemented properly and fully.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Policing was mentioned and is included in the UUP
  amendment. Alex Attwood said that he looks forward to having debates. We have
  had debates with him and other party members in several venues. For the life
  of me, I cannot understand why he wants to have more debates because at any
  that I attended, the SDLP did not seem to do too well.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This motion is more important. It is supposed to be a
  reminder that we are four years on. There are many serious difficulties
  emanating from the non-implementation of the agreement. Michael McGimpsey
  again mentioned north Belfast. I listened to the media this morning and heard
  people talk about being bored by news of north Belfast. It is disgraceful for
  leading journalists and other commentators to talk about being bored by the
  events in north Belfast. Anyone with any insight into or knowledge of what has
  happened there knows that a kernel of the Good Friday Agreement is its ability
  to bring us out of a conflict situation to better times for all. Michael
  McGimpsey should know better. His Colleague, Fred Cobain, Billy Hutchinson and
  others who have been talking with party members and others throughout north
  Belfast know that there is a need to quell the disturbances in that part of
  the city.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This morning we produced a video, and I challenged the PSNI
  to produce its evidence of who was firing guns at it this weekend, never mind
  the last 12 months. Who was throwing the pipe bombs at the weekend? It was not
  football hooligans; it was not people coming from football matches or those
  annoyed at one team or another losing. There are serious difficulties in that
  area, so the conflict is not over for many people here.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McFarland:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am amazed that Sinn Féin introduced the motion. Despite
  what we have just heard, Sinn Féin has not accepted the agreement; there was
  no acceptance of it at the party’s Ard-Fheis. There is no sign that they
  support peaceful and democratic means. Society is in chaos as a result.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What are you doing in Government with them?</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McFarland:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How do they square their words and actions in the community
  over their acceptance of the consent principle — that Northern Ireland is
  British until the people vote otherwise?</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Pat Doherty gave a list of grievances, which consisted
  of problems with the implementation of the agreement. The Republican movement
  has been the biggest obstacle to the implementation of the agreement,
  particularly with its reluctance to start decommissioning. We have heard a
  complaint from Sinn Féin about the implementation group. That is such
  hypocrisy. Sinn Féin was the biggest obstacle to the implementation group.
  They were petrified that the other parties might gang up and give them a
  time-scale for decommissioning. It is only after the second act of
  decommissioning that they now express some urgency for the implementation
  group.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our amendment carries support for the police, and Sinn
  Féin oppose that. What type of society do Sinn Féin want? Nationalist and
  Republican areas have problems with crime, and are no different from other
  areas. Sinn Féin must realise that the Martin Ferris school of justice is not
  the way forward.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One only has to drive through north Belfast, Toomebridge or
  Draperstown to see enormous posters urging people not to join the Police
  Service of Northern Ireland. Sinn Féin cannot afford to stay off the Police
  Board. How will Sinn Féin square the anti-PSNI circle when they join the
  board and expect their people to join the police service?</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Such is the present level of crime that I urge all Members
  to follow the amendment and support the police. I call on the DUP not to run
  under Sinn Féin’s skirts and vote with them again this week. <i>[Interruption].</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. There were several
  inaccuracies in Michael McGimpsey’s statement. Sinn Féin is not the IRA,
  and Unionism needs to get its head around that fundamental fact. Sinn Féin
  does not speak for the IRA. While Michael McGimpsey continues to con himself
  by thinking that that is the case, he will never be able to handle the
  situation. He spoke about north Belfast, and ran away from the issue once
  again. The fundamental problem in north Belfast is that the UUP in particular
  has abandoned a whole section of its own community and left them leaderless
  and in the hands of the idiots in the DUP.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Michael McGimpsey also said that he has a strategy. If he
  has, I wish he would share it with us, so that we could debate it. We have no
  sign of what that strategy is about.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alex Attwood spoke passionately about the implementation
  group, saying that it was the SDLP’s idea. He totally ignored the fact that
  Sinn Féin has been arguing for inclusion in all aspects of politics for
  years. Mr Attwood said that he is looking forward to a debate on policing with
  Sinn Féin. I remind him that we have already had one round of debate in
  Strabane where he was soundly beaten. He has not come forward with a date for
  the second round, which we agreed was to be in Omagh. The people know that the
  SDLP have sold them short on policing.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley’s position is understandable, even
  though it is continually clouded with his bigotry. He is against the Good
  Friday Agreement. He campaigns and rallies against it. The UUP position is
  different, however. They say that they are for the Agreement and then keep
  dodging the issues that would move the situation forward.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">David Ford said that the remaining policing issues are only
  minor matters. I remind Mr Ford that there are still some serious issues to be
  dealt with in the area of policing.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Roche rants and raves on. However, he would not be here
  today if it were not for the Good Friday Agreement that he so despises. Then
  we have Bob McCartney, who is eloquent and passionate, but cannot get past the
  simple fact that the people of Ireland, North and South, democratically
  endorsed the Good Friday Agreement. He laughs at democracy, because it does
  not suit his argument.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I largely agreed with Monica McWilliams’s position,
  although I do not agree with her support for the amendment. I remind her that
  articles 2 and 3 were not removed from the Irish Constitution. They were
  amended and rewritten. I argue that they were rewritten in a much more
  inclusive way than previously.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alan McFarland worries about the Sinn Féin position on
  consent: let me explain it simply. Sinn Féin consented to all aspects of the
  Good Friday Agreement, including the all-Ireland dimension, the Assembly and
  all the issues that deal with justice and equality. We have no problem with
  any of that. We consented to all of the Good Friday Agreement, not to one
  small, narrow aspect of it.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I say to the UUP that we must continue the debate outside
  the House. Let us pursue it and find a way forward, because these idiots are
  going nowhere.</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">asked the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, in

  funding is available for the development of the Causeway Centre in North
  Antrim.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a name="AQO1294/01">(AQO&nbsp;1294/01)</a></p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (Sir Reg
  Empey):</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want the Causeway Centre to be adequately resourced to
  ensure that it meets the standards that we all feel are essential, but it is
  premature at this stage to discuss what specific level of funding support
  might be available from my Department, or from Government in general.
  Naturally, any specific proposal is subject to an application and appraisal
  process.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Kane:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the early 1980s, Moyle District Council took a risk in
  building a visitors’ centre at the Giant’s Causeway. The centre has been
  successfully developed and operated to the point where it is probably the only
  visitors’ centre in Northern Ireland that does not depend on any operating
  subsidy from the ratepayer.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the development and management of a new centre at the
  causeway, why does the Department require the council to bring in third
  parties? Has the plan of action for dispensing natural resource rural tourism
  funding been clearly developed between the Department of Enterprise, Trade and
  Investment and the Department of Finance and Personnel so that action on the
  ground is immediate?</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will recall that an accidental fire destroyed the
  centre two years ago, which was a matter of deep regret. I visited the council
  shortly after the fire, as the Member knows, and expressed my view of the way
  ahead. It was intended that a state-of-the-art centre be built on the existing
  site. I understand that Moyle District Council wants to protect the revenue
  streams that it receives from car parking and operation of the site, which is
  only to be expected.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also told the council that I supported what it wanted to
  do because, like the representatives of the area, I was paying particular
  attention to the council’s wishes. There are several funding sources. There
  is the plan of action on rural tourism, for example. The Environment and
  Heritage Service is interested, as is the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
  There may also be a European dimension. A range of potential funding is
  available. Unfortunately, considerable time was lost because of the best value
  exercise, which held progress back somewhat.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The council has decided only in the past few weeks that it
  wants to proceed. Indeed, my officials will meet the council tomorrow. We are
  anxious to move forward. It is the largest attraction on the island. It has
  huge potential, and we must make progress. I am very keen that we get it
  right. Many people are coming into the market with other ideas, and the
  council should co-operate with the Department in getting the matter started. I
  hope that it will be possible to commission work soon, and I reiterate my
  support for the council’s intentions.</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">asked the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment to
  detail the number of inward investment companies that have visited Knockmore
  Hill Industrial Estate in each of the past three years; the number who have
  chosen to establish factories at the site; and the number of jobs which have
  been created at the estate.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a name="AQO1277/01">(AQO&nbsp;1277/01)</a></p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One inward investment company visited Knockmore Hill
  Industrial Estate in the year ending 31 March 1999. Another visited in the
  year ending 31 March 2000, with a further three in the year ending 31 March
  2001. Two indigenous companies are operating at the park, and they have
  created 85 jobs.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am very disappointed that only five companies visited the
  site. Of the four available sites, this is the only one that has a 30-acre
  land bank that could incorporate large-scale business development. In view of
  the Belfast metropolitan area plan, which will bring more housing into the
  Lagan Valley constituency, and the possibility of further development at the
  Maze Prison site, can the Minister assure the House that Invest Northern
  Ireland will give some real impetus to establishing large-scale companies on
  the Knockmore Hill site and to creating jobs in the Lagan Valley area?</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member will know that my Department cannot dictate to
  investors about where they will locate their businesses. Two companies are due
  to locate in Knockmore Hill Industrial Estate; one factory is nearing
  completion, and building work has commenced on a second. When they are fully
  operational, 79 jobs will be created, in addition to those already mentioned.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards the Belfast metropolitan area plan and the Maze,
  there is a wide range of possibilities. It is frustrating for many Members to
  see vacant sites, but we have been fairly successful in filling vacancies.
  Some of the advance orders for factories that we had — facilities for which
  I was criticised and put under pressure to let go to make room for carpet
  warehouses and such like — have resulted in premises being filled in the
  last year.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am confident that the location, nature and quality of the
  Knockmore Hill site will prove successful in the long run. There is an active
  work programme, and such things tend to gain their own momentum. The Member
  and I want further jobs to be brought into the area, and I am satisfied that
  the people already there and the work under construction will achieve that.</p>

  Road estate in Strabane.</p>

  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot give the Member a precise answer, but I will write
  to him. In general, estates owned by Invest Northern Ireland are primarily for
  the use of former IDB and LEDU client companies.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those people had first refusal on any site anywhere in
  Northern Ireland. Client companies still have first refusal. With reference to
  Mr Poots’s question, several people have shown interest in the Knockmore
  site, but Invest Northern Ireland did not consider their proposals appropriate
  for a quality site such as that. I shall find the details that the Member
  requested and write to him. If he wishes to ask me questions on other
  locations, he will have a future opportunity to do so.</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCarthy</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">asked the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment what
  assessment he has made of the impact of industrial derating on the Northern
  Ireland economy.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a name="AQO1296/01">(AQO&nbsp;1296/01)</a></p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Derating is a useful marketing tool to attract inward
  investment, and it provides some compensation to eligible companies for the
  higher energy costs which apply in Northern Ireland. However, a consultation
  exercise on the future of the rating system will take place soon, and any
  views on industrial derating will be welcomed for consideration.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCarthy:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister agree that the derating initiative is an
  incentive for business investment? The recent suggestion of abolishing
  derating for industry has caused real concern and uncertainty among companies.
  Given our already high electricity, water, transport, insurance and waste
  disposal costs, and the proposed increase to the National Insurance
  contribution, it poses a threat to future employment here. The suggestion of
  derating for industry should be thrown out, thus giving our industries a level
  playing field, bearing in mind the incentives in the Republic of Ireland.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have raised that issue, and the Committee for Enterprise,
  Trade and Investment has written to me about it. I am acutely aware of many
  companies’ views. However, if there is a review of rating, all aspects must
  be open for consideration — none can be excluded.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Derating currently costs £61 million. A sensible review of
  rating will not take place until light is shed on the rights and wrongs of
  derating. I am aware of the points that the Member made, and I hope that, when
  the review commences, he will make his views known. The Committee and my
  Department make their views known, and the sectors that the Member referred to
  will have the opportunity to advance their views also. The fact that the
  matter is being considered does not mean that an outcome has been determined.
  A range of issues must be considered.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand the Member’s concerns. Corporation tax comes
  to mind immediately. People argue that we have a much higher rate of
  corporation tax here and that derating is a form of compensation both for that
  and for the other costs to which the Member referred. I hope that those
  matters will be fully fleshed out during the consultation.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McMenamin:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister comment on the geographical valuation of
  the impact of industrial derating? Has it benefited Strabane and other parts
  of west Tyrone?</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The geographical valuation, as well as TSN and equality
  issues, will inform the consultation exercise. The Member mentioned Strabane.
  The process would significantly benefit that council area. There are some
  substantial industries in the Member’s area that would benefit. The
  geographical distribution of the assistance must be considered.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A significant view must also be taken of the equality
  aspects of the assistance. My Department has commissioned all of that work,
  and that will form part of our input into the consultation.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr J Wilson:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister will agree that industry needs all the help
  that it can get. Does he further agree that prohibitive rates for renewal of
  employer’s liability insurance also have a negative impact on companies in
  my constituency, as demonstrated by last week’s announcement by Contex Ltd?
  What is the Minister doing to address that?</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members have raised questions of insurance with me,
  and I am sure that it affects everybody in the House. The events of September
  11 have clearly had a major impact on that industry. Matters that concern
  Northern Ireland and its system for compensation, as well as what some
  employers would describe as a &quot;claims culture&quot;, have also had an
  impact. I am aware that insurance was a contributory factor in the case to
  which the Member refers. As insurance is a reserved matter, I have been in
  contact with Ruth Kelly, the Economic Secretary at the Treasury, on several
  occasions, and my Department is also assessing exactly what is happening in
  industry and commerce in Northern Ireland as a direct result of insurance
  issues.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members have written to me in the past few weeks
  — they are obviously getting feedback from constituents who are suffering. A
  wide range of subjects are involved; it is not confined to employer’s
  liability. However, you cannot operate without employer’s liability
  insurance. In some sectors, such as construction, few people are prepared to
  offer cover. I have involved the Northern Ireland Office, as we may be
  required to look at how compensation is dealt with. It is dealt with
  differently here than in Great Britain, and we must examine that. I assure the
  Member that that work is continuing.</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a name="AQO1297/01">(AQO&nbsp;1297/01)</a></p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In line with my statement during the Assembly debate on 5
  March 2002 on the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment’s energy
  inquiry, my officials and the regulator are urgently examining all practical
  options for inclusion in an action plan for bringing about worthwhile and
  sustainable electricity price reductions.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr O’Hagan:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wonder how thoroughly public bonds have been explored as
  a way to raise capital, not only for the generation contracts but for other
  issues. Will the Minister tell the House the position of the British Treasury
  on bonds? Go raibh maith agat.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member may know that the Treasury generally feels that
  it is private-sector companies that issue bonds. However, we have been looking
  at bonds for some time, and the Member will know that the Committee for
  Enterprise, Trade and Investment and my Department have been examining the
  matter.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The truth is that as we try to identify issues and areas
  where we can bring some pressure to bear on electricity prices, we are
  desperately searching for the right approach. I have spoken to consultants,
  and held discussions with the Committee, which has done a substantial piece of
  work on energy in general, and we will reach a conclusion in the next few
  weeks on the steps that we can take.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Leaving aside the technicalities, the big issue is whether
  we will effectively be mortgaging the debt to the next generation. We are
  buying out those dreadful contacts that were signed during privatisation in
  1991 and then effectively smearing that debt over the next 30 years. We are
  now almost halfway through the contracts. We must make our minds up about
  these matters over the next few weeks. I do not wish to commit myself to an
  answer in advance of making a statement to the Assembly on the whole picture.
  However, several events will take place. For example, the regulator is
  currently conducting a review of the transmission and distribution systems of
  Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE). He has made recommendations, and after
  receiving feedback, he must make a final determination. If that is disputed,
  it may be passed to the Competition Commission. I have been considering every
  way in which we could put pressure on the market to reduce prices, but I am
  not prepared to commit myself on this issue today.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An increased provision of gas might have a negative effect
  on electricity prices. Will the net impact of the capital cost of building
  pipelines in the Province and interconnections to the Republic or Scotland be
  to raise the final price to the consumer of electricity?</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a complicated issue. The report showed that
  postalisation will cause prices to rise, and we calculated that they would
  rise by a maximum of 1·64%. However, the Member must also remember that one
  of the key elements of any electricity bill is the cost of generation. That
  cost represents 80% of the bill for the industrial market and 60% for the
  domestic market. One element of that cost is a direct fuel cost. The new gas
  plant, which will be part of the overall deal at Coolkeeragh, means that there
  will be a new state-of-the-art generating station, which will be more
  efficient. Together with the new plant that will be commissioned at
  Ballylumford by the end of the year, the net effect of the new equipment will
  be to save fuel and therefore save on price.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member will also be aware that the Executive’s
  decision to proceed with the pipeline proposal, which the House and the
  Committee supported, is being challenged by oil suppliers. Although they have
  the right to do so, the oil industry is unregulated, whereas the gas and
  electricity suppliers are regulated heavily. We must be aware of this matter
  and watch developments closely. The oil sector is trying to refer the matter
  to the European Commission. If we are not careful, that could significantly
  delay our proposals and therefore maintain higher prices for longer. It is
  unfortunate that an unregulated sector is pointing the finger at a regulated
  sector.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Neeson:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with the Minister about the intervention of the oil
  distributors’ association, but I would go further. Does the Minister share
  my anger and concern at its outrageous attempt not only to obstruct, but also
  possibly to wreck, the gas pipeline project?</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I intend to see that the project is not wrecked. It was the
  will of the House and the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, and
  an enormous amount of work went into it. We have not yet determined what
  source we will use to finance it. We have several options, and European
  support is one of them. The oil sector considers the project to be
  anti-competitive. Thirty-five per cent of funding for the electricity
  interconnector came from Europe, and the Scotland to Northern Ireland Pipeline
  (SNIPS) also received European assistance.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those are two major infrastructure projects. I see the gas
  pipeline and the provision of Coolkeeragh as a major piece of strategic
  infrastructure, and it is unfortunate that people have chosen to challenge
  that. Both these industries are highly regulated, yet the oil sector is not,
  and the public needs to bear that in mind. It is unfortunate that people are
  attempting to thwart what is clearly the will of people for a strategic
  decision. Many jobs are at stake, and over £200&nbsp;million of investment in
  Londonderry alone is at stake. We have to realise that we are playing for very
  high stakes.</p>

  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">asked the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment for
  his assessment of the suitability of the industrial development site at Creagh,
  in the Magherafelt district, as a strategic employment location.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a name="AQO1275/01">(AQO&nbsp;1275/01)</a></p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The regional development strategy for 2025 envisages the
  provision of a limited number of strategic employment locations. An
  interdepartmental working group has been established with the aim of
  identifying the actual number and locations, but no strategic employment
  locations have yet been identified.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Armstrong:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister will know that there is a prospective need for
  this type of employment. Has he instructed Invest Northern Ireland to commence
  a programme? Will the Minister support the designation of an industrial site
  at Creagh as a strategic employment location?</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am well aware of the Creagh site. The Member has raised
  this with me before, as have other Members. Indeed, I am shortly to see a
  delegation led by another Member about this site.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department has not yet decided to support any site.
  However, I can say that the site development at Creagh is well under way, with
  initial site clearance and the enabling contract nearing completion. It is
  planned that sites will be available from this autumn at Creagh, and a number
  of business interests have been recorded already. This is one of the issues
  being considered with regard to the area plan. I will have to withhold giving
  the Member a categorical assurance until we see the overall picture, and we
  must also have regard to the local area plan.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr William McCrea:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have already spoken to the Minister about this and
  forwarded initial papers to him. I thank him and his Department for their
  willingness to meet us. The Minister may not be aware that the Planning
  Service of the Department of the Environment has already met an initial
  delegation on this and that the Department for Regional Development has also
  agreed to a similar meeting.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the light of all this vital interest among the
  Departments, can the Minister assure the House that the Department for
  Regional Development, the Department of the Environment and the Department of
  Enterprise, Trade and Investment will work together on the designation of a
  strategic employment location at Creagh, which is vital to the development of
  our community?</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate that the Member did not press me too hard on
  the designation, although I know that I would not have to press him too hard
  to get him to indicate his preference. I can assure him that my Department,
  the Department for Regional Development and the Department of the Environment
  will have absolutely no difficulty in working together. If we are to make any
  sense of this, we must work together. There is a regional dimension and a
  local dimension to the project.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is growing concern, which Mr Poots obliquely referred
  to in an earlier question, about plans for housing and other development, and
  the question is whether we are leaving enough space for industrial
  development. In some areas it is in relatively short supply, and we are
  looking at the total sweep of available land. I am conscious of that, and I
  can give the Member the assurance he seeks.</p>

  steps are being taken to find a replacement entrepreneur for Step2 in
  Coleraine, which recently closed down production.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a name="AQO1259/01">(AQO&nbsp;1259/01)</a></p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Step2 Company (NI) Ltd was a subsidiary of the
  privately owned Step2 Company in the United States. A downturn in market
  conditions and increased competition led to a decision to reduce operations in
  several locations, including Northern Ireland. A replacement entrepreneur
  could not have been introduced in the timescale required, because the decision
  was made without consultation with officials or local management.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dallat:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister will be aware from his many visits to
  Coleraine and his meetings with the chamber of commerce and the local council
  that there is a nervousness about the town’s narrow industrial base. Does he
  agree that there is an absolute urgency to go all out to attract inward
  investment from the United States, or wherever we can get it, so that there is
  a more stable economy in Coleraine?</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These are difficult times for inward investment. To give
  the Member some perspective on his area, Invest Northern Ireland currently has
  17 client companies in the East Londonderry constituency, employing almost
  3,000 people. Since April 1996, selective financial assistance of £55·4
  million towards company project investments totalling £238·6 million has
  been offered, promoting 1,168 new jobs and safeguarding a further 2,900.
  Invest Northern Ireland and its predecessor organisations have put much work
  into the Coleraine/ Limavady area, with some considerable success. The
  decision that the Member referred to was undoubtedly unusual and unfortunate.
  Discussions took place with the company to try to give it marketing and
  product development assistance, but decisions were taken without any reference
  whatsoever to the Department.</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a name="AQO1291/01">(AQO&nbsp;1291/01)</a></p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister for Employment and Learning (Ms Hanna):</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The total funds surrendered from the student loans budget
  for each of the last three financial years are as follows: £7·5 million in
  1999-2000; £1·19 million in 2000-01; and in 2001-02, nil was surrendered.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Maskey:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the decreasing figures are a sign of things to
  come. I presume that they reflect good management as well as other
  circumstances. Notwithstanding those figures, should there be any such
  underspends in the future, will any of that money be ploughed back into the
  budget in order to deal with the ever-increasing levels of student debt? What
  would be described generally as inadequate funding for third-level education?</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Hanna:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The funding for student loans comes from the Treasury; it
  is not part of the block grant. It is a demand-led service. The Department
  must provide resources for every student, but if they do not all take up that
  loan, the resource must be surrendered.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Attwood:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What are the current student grant arrangements, given the
  comment made by Mr Maskey about student need and debt? Has the Minister any

  student grant aid might be extended?</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Hanna:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course there is student need. Dr Seán Farren’s £65
  million package is coming on stream in September. Part of that package will be
  student grants of up to £1,500 for all students from households with an
  income of less than £15,000. The Minister of Finance and Personnel is aware
  that I intend to seek further resources for student support in order to widen
  access and to ensure that financial support goes where it is needed most —
  to those who are least well off.</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a name="AQO1267/01">(AQO&nbsp;1267/01)</a></p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Hanna:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 75 applies to designated public authorities only.
  My Department provides funding to non-departmental public bodies such as
  Enterprise Ulster, the Labour Relations Agency and higher and further
  education institutes, which are responsible for fulfilling statutory equality
  duties. My Department is working closely with those bodies to assist them and
  to ensure that a joined-up approach is taken.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Nelis:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department for Employment and Learning has the power to
  extend to the private, voluntary and community sectors the principles that the
  Equality Commission envisaged. Will the Minister do that? What checks does her
  Department have in place to ensure that all the organisations that it funds
  meet their statutory obligations? The board of the Waterside Area Partnership
  comprises members of every political party except Sinn Féin. Will the
  Minister address the fact that an organisation that receives funding from her
  Department is practising blatant political exclusion?</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Hanna:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not know the position as regards the board of the
  Waterside Area Partnership, so I shall respond to the Member later.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Department has formed partnerships with bodies to ensure
  that they fulfil their statutory obligations under section 75. Ongoing
  informal consultation is taking place with many organisations to raise
  awareness of that duty and to promote equality of opportunity.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Courtney:</p>

  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Hanna:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Through its programme of equality impact assessments the
  Department has put in place arrangements for monitoring the impact of its
  policies on the promotion of equality of opportunity. Those arrangements
  extend to monitoring programmes and services that are delivered by
  organisations on behalf of the Department.</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I plan to introduce proposals for a replacement scheme in
  the early autumn, in line with the Programme for Government targets. In
  delivering a new initiative, I will take account of several factors, including
  lessons learnt from the initial scheme, the considerations of the
  employability taskforce, and developments in England, Scotland and Wales.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Lewsley:</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The forthcoming review of the individual learning accounts
  scheme will show the extent to which people have been encouraged to return to
  learning.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Hanna:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes. Although several issues emerged as regards the
  operation of the original individual learning accounts scheme, the user survey
  that is now being analysed confirmed that the scheme had many positive
  effects. Although the survey showed that 90% of people were satisfied with
  their training and had increased their skills or knowledge, it also indicated
  that there was some deadweight and that the level of participation by the less
  well off was only 20%.</p>

  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Hanna:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A few broad themes have already emerged from the replies to
  the discussion documents and the engagement meetings, including benefits traps
  and the fear of moving from benefit to employment, the availability and
  affordability of childcare provision, and transport. Those concerns and many
  others are being pursued with the relevant Departments through bilateral

  potential workers?</p>
  <b>

  the Minister aware that the Public Accounts Committee at Westminster was
  scathing in its criticism of the firm, after the role it played in the

  September 2002. The Department for Employment and Learning continues to
  promote the programme and to recruit participants. Some 26 young people
  recently completed their pre-departure training, and they travelled to take up
  jobs in the United States on 5 May.</p>

  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Hanna:</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most of the young people have stayed in the United States,
  but I do not possess the exact figures. It is estimated that £750,000 will be

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with the Member, and I am hopeful that the Walsh

  encourage participation from both sides of the community. Recently we have
  focused marketing activity on the Unionist community, initially in the Greater
  Belfast area, through targeted mailshots and invitations from representative
  organisations to meet with the programme management. Further steps will be
  taken to ensure future advertising for recruitment to the programme, which
  will pay special attention to areas that appear to be under-represented. We
  must remember that the young people who avail of this opportunity are
  generally from poorer, disadvantaged backgrounds.</p>

  that almost a quarter of adults have the reading age of an 11-year-old at
  best, and at worst cannot read a telephone directory, a bus timetable or a
  label on a medicine bottle. Therefore, it is important that we pursue the
  strategy, and I shall chair the essential skills committee to ensure that we
  meet the targets.</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What are the key targets of the strategy?</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Hanna:</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department’s main targets are, by September 2002, to
  establish an essential skills committee that is representative of all the main
  interests in the field. I will chair that committee to drive the strategy
  forward, and to have a regional curriculum in place for essential skills at
  entry level. By January 2003 we intend to launch a promotional campaign to
  engage new learners, with a major drive in September 2003. By 2004 we want to
  have increased the tutor base for learners by 50%. By 2005 we hope to have
  supported 25,000 learners. The biggest challenge will be to engage with people
  in the community who, for various reasons, have missed out on their education
  — people who are casualties of the education system. We have to go where it
  suits them, as they may not want to go into a classroom situation. If that is
  the case, we must go to the community and engage with them.</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Department has just concluded a review of New Deal for
  18-24 year olds. The results of that, together with recent independent
  evaluations, will form the basis of improvements that will be implemented over
  the coming months. Many of those will be in line with the National Audit
  Office recommendations. The National Audit Office published a report on New
  Deal for 18-24 year olds on 28 February. It examined how effective the
  programme had been in reducing unemployment and how it might be improved. The
  overall conclusion was that New Deal had been successful in placing young
  people in work, although, as with other labour market programmes, its impact
  in placing young people in jobs that they would not have got otherwise is less
  pronounced. The report also made several recommendations aimed at improving
  the performance of the programme.</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister’s reply almost answered the question. I want
  to focus on the so-called dead weight problem. The National Audit Office found
  that in Great Britain a substantial proportion of young people probably would
  have found work anyway. Is there comparable research to estimate the scale of
  dead weight in Northern Ireland’s New Deal? If there is, what can be done
  about the problem?</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member is correct in that it is easier to run a scheme
  with well-motivated participants in areas where the labour market is buoyant.
  However, such a scheme has less impact on participants who are poorly
  motivated or face multiple barriers to employment. Those are some of the
  problems that my Department is tackling through the employability and
  long-term unemployment task forces.</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister for Social Development (Mr Dodds):</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I fully recognise that the problem of homelessness is
  increasing. I am determined to address it. In the current financial year
  funding available to the Northern Ireland Housing Executive has allowed an
  increase of £400,000 to £3·4 million to deal with services specifically for
  homeless people. In addition, I hope that homeless people will benefit from
  bids for extra funding made by the Department for Social Development for the
  years 2003 to 2006. I have no doubt that Members who are interested in
  homelessness will support those bids.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Courtney:</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am delighted to hear that extra money has been allocated.

  address the specific problem of homelessness?</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I have indicated, homelessness is a significant problem
  that my Colleagues and I are determined to address. In conjunction with the
  Housing Executive, other Departments and agencies that are concerned with the
  issue, the Department for Social Development will continue to examine ways in
  which it can improve the services that it provides. Clearly, the Department
  recognised that there are funding implications.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member has raised the specific issue in relation to the
  announcement that was made last week. The money is available by way of loans
  and is primarily aimed at infrastructure programmes and projects. Regardless
  of that, we have submitted, and will be submitting, bids for increased funding
  to deal with services to homeless people and housing generally. The Department
  recognises the social problems but cannot tackle them alone. However, we will

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to formally put on record my welcome to Mr Weir and
  thank him for his contribution from the Benches behind me. I congratulate him
  on the wisdom of his move and wish him many happy years on these Benches —

  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Weir:</p>

  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes. The Member asked about homelessness, but he has found
  his true home today.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There have been some misguided and spurious comments in the
  press about the homelessness issue and the new housing Bill from people who
  should know better. The draft Bill, which has been widely welcomed across the
  board, will impact on homelessness by redefining homelessness and intentional
  homelessness, the treatment of persons from abroad and those found guilty of
  antisocial behaviour. The proposals will not detract from the priority for
  rehousing presently given to homeless applicants who meet the statutory
  criteria for assistance under homelessness legislation.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member asked about the timetable. The consultation
  period finished at the end of April. I hope to lay the Bill before the
  Assembly in June, with a view to it becoming law early next year.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would point out that — and this is where there has been
  some misguided comment — legislation itself will not impact significantly on
  homelessness as social problem. Other means must be explored to do that. I
  will continue to work with other statutory agencies and Departments, along
  with the Housing Executive, to do precisely that.</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs I Robinson</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">asked the Minister for Social Development, pursuant to AQO&nbsp;672/01,
  what plans he has to counter cases of benefit fraud within the Social Security
  Agency.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a name="AQO1303/01">(AQO&nbsp;1303/01)</a></p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The level of social security fraud is totally unacceptable.
  I am committed to a robust approach to tackling fraud and abuse of the social
  security system on all fronts. Fraud and abuse are serious problems, but the
  Social Security Agency’s management and staff are tackling them with great
  determination. The agency has a comprehensive fraud strategy that contains an
  extensive programme of initiatives designed to ensure that claims entering the
  system are legitimate; that, once in the system, claims are maintained
  properly; and that, where fraud and error enter the system, they are detected
  and appropriate action is taken.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The agency works closely with several other bodies to
  maximise effectiveness. The approach is paying off, and I plan to continue
  with it. For example, in the last 12 months, fraud investigations were carried
  out into nearly 13,000 cases, and the rate of benefit was changed in over
  5,500 cases. A total of 753 cases were referred for prosecution or sanction.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs I Robinson:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How much money does the Department estimate has been lost
  to benefit fraudsters across Northern Ireland over the last five years? How
  much does the Department expect to claw back from those criminal elements over
  the next number of years?</p>
  <i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.00 pm</p>
  </i><b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Benefit cheats defraud not only the Government, but their
  neighbours and communities. The idea seems to exist that benefit fraud causes
  no pain, but the perpetrators take money from the pockets of the needy. To
  abuse the benefit system in that way is to steal from the rest of society.
  Since the agency implemented the strategy to tackle fraud, an additional £9
  million has been invested each year to reduce all benefit fraud and errors. As
  a result, the agency estimates that the target is to recover £15 million of
  overpayments during the coming three-year period. That includes all categories
  of overpayments. It is not possible to estimate the amount that is directly
  attributable to criminal elements. It is estimated that each year an average
  of £32 million is lost to benefit fraudsters, and that figure is in the
  public domain.</p>

  1999-2000, 2000-2001 and 2001-2002; and (b) whose on-site construction

  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1999-2000, my Department projected the completion of
  1,200 new build social housing dwellings, and 1,241 were completed. In
  2000-01, the completion of a further 1,200 was projected, and 1,210 were
  built. In 2001-02, the completion of 1,500 dwellings was planned, and 1,554
  were completed. The majority of social housing schemes are completed within 12
  months, but most start in one financial year and reach completion in the next.
  In that context, on-site construction on only a small number of dwellings was
  commenced and completed, with the units made ready for occupation, in the same
  financial year. The figures are as follows: 10 were commenced and completed in
  1999-2000, six in 2000-01, and four in 2001-02. However, given the figures
  that I mentioned earlier, all those units were completed in each of those
  financial years.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dallat:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s reply and his confirmation that
  the units were finished on target. Does he agree that the time has come to
  deliver social housing according to need rather than on the basis of targets
  that bear no real relationship to demand?</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department does not base its provision on targets.
  Targets are set so that we can measure performance and the extent to which
  needs are being met. The Housing Executive is responsible for assessing the
  housing need, and, together with the Department, it sets the targets. However,
  the Department always considers the level of housing need and the amount of
  new build that is required. The provision of new build housing should be, and
  is, based on housing and social need.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister has responded well. What are the main problems
  that the housing associations face when delivering new build programmes? What
  measures have been taken to improve the programmes?</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Department had unlimited supplies of money, it could
  build more houses and do more. I am therefore keen to bid for more funding for
  social housing and the housing budget generally. If we had more money, we
  could do more. Due to land acquisition costs, the last few years have been
  difficult for housing associations. There has been a major increase in land
  prices that affects their ability to compete in the open market. It now takes
  housing associations longer to get planning permission, resulting in delays.
  However, despite those delays, they are meeting their targets. It would help
  if schemes were to start on site earlier in the year. I have created a working
  party of officials from my Department, the Housing Executive and housing
  associations to consider ways in which performance can be improved.</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main published target for house sales is to make an
  offer within 10 weeks of application in 95% of cases. The most recent
  monitoring information, available at December 2001, shows performance to be
  about 73%. Unprecedented demand has been a significant contributory factor. At
  its meeting on 24 April, the Housing Executive board agreed to several actions
  to improve performance. Those included giving house sales priority over other
  land and property functions; allowing additional staff in its three
  operational units; and making administrative changes to simplify the
  processing of historic cost information. The Housing Executive will continue
  to monitor performance and will consider action accordingly. The Housing
  Executive will inform applicants that, due to the exceptionally high levels of
  applications, processing may take longer than the target times in some cases.
  All applications will be dealt with in date order.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Byrne:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although many tenants agree a sale price with the Housing
  Executive, its land and property services section can take more than three
  months to process the legal requirements. Unfortunately, that means that
  people who have a mortgage offer, which expires after three months, can find
  themselves in limbo. They have agreed the house purchase price, and they have
  a mortgage, but because the legal requirements have not been completed they
  must find a new mortgage.</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How does the house-sales policy affect housing stock and

  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Generally, tenants who avail of the opportunity to buy
  their homes from the Housing Executive, or housing associations, remain in
  those houses. Therefore such houses are not available for allocation to those
  on waiting lists.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The number of people on waiting lists and their waiting
  times are influenced by factors such as the number of re-lets that become
  available; the new build programme; the demand on a particular area; and the
  tenant’s choice of area. There may be areas in which houses are available;
  but tenants may not particularly want to go there. All of those factors must
  be taken into account.</p>

  local projects. I wish that some Members who speak about the matter would go
  away and read up on some of the responsibilities to which they, as the
  proponents of the system, actually agreed. When my hon Friend the Member for
  Strangford, Mrs Iris Robinson, put the matter before the Assembly two weeks
  ago in an Adjournment debate, the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy
  First Minister responded to it.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member who spoke to me in the corridor on this and
  other issues came to the Chamber and made pejorative remarks to the effect
  that Mr Dodds should have contributed to the debate, and that he might be
  boycotting the Assembly as well as the Executive. Those remarks are uncalled
  for. If she were to talk to some of her Colleagues who attended a meeting in
  this Building, she would know that when dozens of women from various groups
  across Belfast and the Province came to speak to MLAs, few Members bothered to
  turn up. I was among those who did. One or two of her party Colleagues were
  there, but she was noticeable by her absence.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Member wants to deal with the issue seriously,
  rather than score cheap points, it would be more fitting for her to talk to
  the Department and to others who are interested in it. I remind her and other
  Members that the issues that the women’s sector deals with span the
  interests of several Departments. Women’s health and childcare issues are a
  matter for the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety.
  Education, employment and training activities that take place in women’s
  centres meet the interests of various Departments. The core problem of
  deciding which support structures best equip women to play a full part in the
  economic, social and community life of Northern Ireland is a matter that the
  Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister may wish to
  consider in the light of its responsibilities for gender equality.</p>
  <i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.15 pm</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I take my responsibilities seriously. I meet people; I will
  continue to pursue the matter vigorously; and I expect the support of Members

  plans to address the funding shortfall being experienced by Citizens Advice
  Bureaux.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a name="AQO1276/01">(AQO&nbsp;1276/01)</a></p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main responsibility for funding local advice centres,
  including the Citizens Advice Bureaux, lies with district councils. The
  Department for Social Development contributes to this funding through the
  community support programme that enables councils to support Citizens Advice
  Bureaux. I was delighted to secure additional funding of almost £1 million
  during 2001-02 for that programme. Although the funding was not directed
  solely to Citizens Advice Bureaux, the local advice sector is benefiting from
  the additional provision.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Armstrong:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister knows the benefit of Citizens Advice Bureaux
  and other organisations such as Cookstown Benefit Uptake Campaign. Our
  community depends on such groups. Will the Minister address the problem so
  that he can increase the amount of money in the community support programme
  that is ring-fenced for local advice agencies?</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recognise the value of local advice centres, particularly
  Citizens Advice Bureaux. I regularly meet people from that sector, and I am
  aware of their valuable work. However, Citizens Advice Bureaux are funded by
  various sources, including the Department for Social Development, district
  councils, health and social services trusts, the Community Fund, the Belfast
  Regeneration Office, the Londonderry Development Office, charitable trusts and
  European Union funding. Funding for the 24 bureaux and the 109 outreach
  centres across Northern Ireland amounted to £2,383,581 in 2000-01, which is
  the last year for which information is available. In addition to funding local
  bureaux under the community support programme, the Department provides core
  funding for the regional organisation, the Northern Ireland Association of
  Citizens Advice Bureaux, which will receive £383,216 in this financial year.
  The sector receives a substantial amount of money.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the community support programme for local
  advice services, 80% of the funding is provided by district councils, and the
  remaining 20% is provided by the Department. The idea of ring-fencing part of
  that funding is inconsistent with the new planning framework, as it requires
  councils to decide how best to utilise the resources for the programme.</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am disappointed with the response, given that the
  Assembly unanimously supported a motion that asked Departments to initiate the
  use of townland names on all correspondence, and the Minister’s Department
  is one of the largest, with the most customers. As townland names are now
  readily available from the Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland on Stranmillis
  Road, will the Minister ask his Department to take the lead in availing of
  that service, rather than depend on the information on correspondence? The
  Department should take the lead in using townland names, where applicable, in
  all replies to customers.</p>

  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask the Minister to be brief.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In answer to the Member’s supplementary question in the
  House on 8 April, I detailed the social housing plans for the next three-year
  period. In summary, nine new homes are currently under construction, with a
  further 218 planned for the period 2002-03 to 2004-05 throughout the Lagan
  Valley constituency. The Housing Executive, as the arbiter of housing need in
  the Province, assures me that the current housing needs of the area are
  largely being met. However, it is also aware that there has recently been an
  increase in waiting lists and housing stress in many areas, including Lisburn.
  A review and analysis of these trends is currently in progress. The annual
  roll-forward of the programme is due to take place in December, and my
  Department, in consultation with the Housing Executive, will look afresh at
  the information emanating from the waiting lists in Lagan Valley, and will
  reprioritise the new-build programme as appropriate.</p>

  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill:</p>
  </font></b><font SIZE="3">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I beg to move</p>
  </font><font SIZE="1">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That this Assembly calls for the implementation of
  procedures to simplify the house-buying process and, in particular, to
  regulate estate agents and to provide financial concessions for first-time
  buyers.</p>
  </font><font SIZE="3">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the opportunity to debate this issue on the Floor
  of the Assembly. It is over a year since I first embarked on a fact-finding
  and information-gathering task to see what we can do to help first-time
  buyers, in particular, to cope with the problems of making what may be the
  greatest financial undertaking of their lives.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nobody in Ireland or Britain can have failed to notice the
  recent spiralling increase in house prices. That may be a welcome trend here
  in Northern Ireland. Stability has followed the peace process, and an increase
  in property prices reflects some kind of economic upturn. However, I believe
  that it has brought several problems with it, and I have some concerns about
  what this kind of price rise will mean.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the first instance, it is eclipsing the increase in
  wages, and the gap, particularly for first-time buyers, is widening.
  First-time buyers had no problem accessing a mortgage four or five years ago,
  but that category can no longer do so. The first-quarter figures for this year
  show a small drop of 0·7% in house prices, believe it or not, but you get a
  better picture if you look at the last three years, during which there was a
  22% increase in prices. There has been no comparative increase in income
  levels and salaries to compensate for that. That is where the concern arises.
  If we are to avoid the kind of situations we have seen recently in London and
  Dublin, we should try to put together some means of dealing with it.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Co-ownership in Northern Ireland has been one of the more
  successful initiatives introduced to help people who have difficulty getting
  into the housing market in the first instance. Uptake in co-ownership has been
  vastly more successful in Northern Ireland than anywhere else in the United
  Kingdom. A total of 16,681 households have taken part in the scheme, and 74%
  of those have &quot;staircased up&quot; in that they have entirely bought out
  the part of the house they were renting and have become full owner-occupiers.
  Of those who have not done so, two thirds have remained in the home-owning
  market, even though they may still not have bought out the portion they were
  renting.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recently there has been an increase in the amount of money
  available, and there has been an increase in the levels of house prices that
  can be dealt with. However, I particularly want to draw attention to this
  today because it is not enough. In April, the scheme had 50% more applications
  than expected. There is a big demand; people want to make use of this facility
  in order to enter the first-time buyers’ market. There is an indication that
  this trend will increase. There is also a suggestion that the equity margin
  might be reduced from 50% to 40%. I urge the Minister and his Department to
  consider whether this is possible alongside the co-ownership scheme and also
  if it is possible to provide some further funding.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The home buy scheme has been successful in Wales. It
  differs from the co-ownership scheme in that the Government offers an
  interest-free loan on a percentage of the mortgage, which in Wales currently
  stands at 25%. When the property is sold, the owners are required to pay this
  back, together with the same percentage of the profit made on the property.
  Even if in Northern Ireland it were a mere 10% to begin with, first-time
  buyers might be able to use it as an opportunity to get on to the first rung
  of the ladder towards homeownership.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People sometimes argue for a first-time buyer’s grant and
  some type of Government intervention. In the South, where this practice has
  been in operation for some time, evidence indicates that this becomes
  incorporated into the house price. It pushes up the price of the property and,
  in the end, is little help to the first-time buyer. Although it would appear
  to be a helpful suggestion, it has not been proven to give great support to
  the first-time buyer.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A popular suggestion has been to scrap stamp duty for
  first-time buyers. We hope to see the first benefits of that when the
  legislation comes into force in January next year.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the motion is not simply about affordability per
  se; it is also about making the process of buying a home more efficient. There
  are several streams in the motion, all of which will be helpful if they are
  examined and advanced.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the main recommendations of the report published in
  2000, ‘Improving the House Buying Process — Recommendations of the General
  Consumer Council for NI’, was the establishment of a seller’s pack along
  the lines of the prepared legislation in the United Kingdom. This pack would
  contain relevant information on the property, including property certificates,
  warranties and, most importantly, details of a house condition survey.</p>
  <i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.30 pm</p>
  </i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is debate about the effectiveness of the seller’s
  pack. I hope that when that important issue is looked at, we will look at the
  needs of Northern Ireland and adopt that excellent idea to suit the needs of
  Northern Ireland, and there are reasons for that.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All buyers — not just first-time buyers — find
  themselves having to pay for more than one survey each time they are
  interested in a home. It is not unusual for several different surveys to be
  commissioned for one house, and those surveys may all have differing results
  depending on the standards of the surveyor. That is simply a waste of money,
  and the people who benefit are not the buyers or sellers.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government in Westminster have put the surprising
  figure of £380 million wasted annually on a process that is not completed.
  When a house-buyer is interested in a house he has a survey carried out, and
  if the sale is not completed the money spent on the survey is lost. The
  house-buyer could also have legal and other fees, and if the deal is not
  completed, that money is also lost. That is a huge amount of money.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How many millions of pounds are wasted in Northern Ireland
  each year on aborted transactions? That includes money spent on surveys that
  tell buyers that they cannot afford to buy, money paid to solicitors for
  carrying out wasted work, and weeks or months wasted in trying to purchase a
  house, during which time house prices continue to rise.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As most sellers go on to buy another property, an outlay on
  a seller’s pack would balance itself out. The pack is formulated upfront,
  but it does not need to be paid for upfront. It could be incorporated into the
  whole process. There would be great benefits in having a seller’s pack.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To further simplify the process it has been suggested that
  buyers should have access to information prior to and during the house-buying
  process. At present the buyer must buy advice from a professional body. The
  General Consumer Council (GCC) identified difficulties in accessing written
  quotations to enable the buyer to shop around, and it recommends that clear
  information should be available to buyers.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many people entering the property arena have no idea of
  what to expect, what costs are involved or what the pitfalls are. A totally
  independent, Government-regulated buyer’s information pack would save time,
  money and unnecessary inconvenience for the independent buyer.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion calls for the regulation of estate agents. Many
  buyers and sellers are unclear about what to expect from estate agents, what
  costs are involved and what their rights are. I have seldom met any buyers,
  particularly first-time buyers, who were completely satisfied that the process
  had been open and transparent and that everything had been done correctly.
  Other Members could bear me out on that. Even if that is only a perception, it
  should be removed.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is an ombudsman in England, and the introduction of
  an ombudsman service in Northern Ireland would make people more secure in the
  transactions that they undertake. It would leave the process more open and
  examinable.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Contrary to some suggestions, many estate agents in
  Northern Ireland have voluntarily become involved in the English system and
  have become members of the club that makes use of the ombudsman service. The
  estate agent in my town is one of the few in the area to have become involved,
  and that is to be commended. However, it should not be voluntary; it should be
  mandatory, and through that service we could gain confidence in the
  house-buying process.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The ombudsman service in Northern Ireland would dictate
  that estate agents must make a consumer guide available, thus committing
  themselves to a fair and stringent code of practice. The buyer would be able
  to access internal complaints procedures and have a legal right of access to
  bidding books so that they could see the bidding on a house. It would wipe out
  the possibility that estate agents have the ability to push up prices for
  their own benefit.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The process of buying a house must be overhauled,
  particularly in the light of what we have learnt from our counterparts in
  Dublin and London. This is a detailed matter, and I have touched only briefly
  on some of the issues. I am glad that the Minister for Social Development is
  present and taking an interest in the debate. I hope that he will take the
  issue to his Department and see what he can come up with.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir John Gorman:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My party supports the general thrust of what Mr ONeill has
  advocated. It is worth making the point that several large planning
  applications are being made for housing estates in Northern Ireland. It would
  be in the interest of the less well-to-do or first-time buyers if part of the
  planning application ensured that they could afford some of the properties on
  the estate.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill’s words about the Northern Ireland Co-Ownership
  Housing Association were wise and timely. The acquisition of 16,000 new homes
  for people who might not otherwise have been able to afford them is a great
  achievement. I am happy to say that that occurred at a time when I had a fair
  amount to do with housing.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another way to help the less well off was the self-build
  scheme, which got off to a good start in Northern Ireland. The Housing
  Executive paid for advisers to ensure that people did not embark on the scheme
  without knowing what was required to build a house, and that it did not fall
  down or turn out to be a useless property. It may be worth looking at that
  scheme again. There is no doubt that people need to get their feet on the
  first rung of the housing ladder. If we do not enable them to do so, it will
  cause disruption for the rest of their lives, whether they are married or not.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Mr ONeill pointed out, there is a degree of naivety
  among those who have never embarked on anything that approaches the required
  sums of money that are being talked about. One hears of figures in the region
  of £70,000 or £80,000 as if they were throwaway prices. Imagine two young
  people attempting to visualise that amount of money in their hands. We must
  ensure that a sufficient amount of social housing, which the Minister for
  Social Development is eager to have, is made available. We must also ensure
  that when people are thinking of buying a house, they get all the help
  possible. The seller’s pack — or even a buyer’s pack — would be a
  sensible way to do that. The Council of Mortgage Lenders Northern Ireland
  might be prepared to put money into that, because it would suit that body.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would not be too difficult to reduce the co-ownership
  quotient from 50% to 40%. If we do not tackle that matter, we shall have many
  disgruntled and unhappy young people who will never be able to achieve what
  nearly all of us have achieved.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support Mr ONeill’s motion. This is an opportune time
  to try to address some of the issues of concern, not just to Mr ONeill as an
  elected representative, but also to me. People have visited my advice centre
  with the same problems that have been reiterated today. If we cast our minds
  back to the first time that we purchased a house — presumably all Members
  have done so — the process of borrowing the money and working out the system
  of repayment was simple. Today it is not. We are trying to address that.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to make a couple of points about some relevant
  issues that my constituents have raised. From time to time estate agents hand
  out personal telephone numbers. Perhaps the Assembly cannot make a ruling on
  that, but it does happen. Those numbers then become the method of contact
  between the vendor and the purchaser. However, that system bypasses the estate
  agent. In many cases, it can cause heartache. Disagreements can arise over the
  completion date, for example, all because the estate agent gave out the
  telephone number. That point should be taken on board at an early stage.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also hear many complaints about bidding wars. I use that
  terminology because that is exactly what they are. In the past month, people
  have told me of cases where the person who put in a higher bid has suddenly
  backed out and the estate agent has come back with his tail between his legs
  to ask if they will still hold firm to their earlier bid. Bidding wars and the
  role that some estate agents play in them is a matter that must be addressed.
  It is ridiculous that house prices should soar simply because some estate
  agents are acting in that way — presumably higher prices mean more
  commission.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are not only highlighting the issues here; we are also
  seeking solutions. An independent third party should monitor the process. That
  party should not be in receipt of commission on completion of the sale. That
  is one way to address the issue. It would guarantee the vendor and the
  purchaser complete impartiality, and the sale could go ahead. The third party
  would not be concerned about selling at a higher price to get more commission
  or about delaying the sale to see what happens.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also want to highlight the issue of fixed interest rates.
  It is important that first-time buyers get a foothold in the market. They are
  penalised for the housing market’s rise and fall, and they are being priced
  out of the market by mortgage rates. The mover of the motion mentioned that
  some people are unable to get mortgages because they are impossible to bring
  together. The Assembly is in the business of giving first-time buyers the
  opportunity to purchase houses, but to do so we must ensure that they have a
  mortgage that they can pay back in a time that they can cope with. We must
  also ensure that they are given all the help they need to ensure that the
  process runs smoothly.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First-time buyers should know all the options available to
  them. They should be presented in a clear and simple way. They should know
  about co-ownership, about social housing and about all the different aspects
  of the house-buying process, so that they can make a decision based upon all
  the available information.</p>
  <i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.45 pm</p>
  </i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There should be a level playing field in the housing
  market, so that people who buy to invest do not monopolise the market and
  therefore reduce the number of homes available to young couples starting out.
  I make that point because it has happened to some people that I have been
  involved with, and those concerns come directly from my constituents. Those
  who are buying to address their need or buying for the first time should
  receive help; not those who are buying houses to sell later on and make a
  profit. I am not against property investment, but it is unfair in that it
  penalises those buying for the first time.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to suggest a way of trying to address some of the
  heartaches and problems that arise in house-buying, especially for first-time
  buyers. Estate agents could publish a booklet that would explain the whole
  system. It could detail what is available; where the help is; the types of
  housing available; and the terminology involved. It should also detail the
  fees involved, such as stamp duty and search fees, because people need an idea
  of what the process of buying a house costs so that they can budget
  accordingly. It should detail all the moneys involved so that there are no
  hidden add-ons or costs that they are unaware of. In many cases first-time
  buyers are on a finite budget, and they need to know how far their money will
  have to go.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The booklet should outline the responsibilities of the
  sellers, the buyers and all others involved in house purchase. We must get the
  details down, safeguard the first-time buyer and give them the protection that
  they need. It should not be a rule book; it should be a guideline or Highway
  Code for first-time buyers.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I suggest the use of an independent negotiator, who can
  resolve issues around such items as completion dates. Many people approach us
  about problems with completion dates; they are annoyed at being put off month
  after month and the process becomes laborious and awkward. It would be helpful
  to have someone to negotiate on that type of problem. The negotiator should
  not have a vested interest — like an estate agent’s commission or a
  solicitor’s fee — in the completion of the contract. The negotiator should
  be independent.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many people are frustrated, angry and bewildered with the
  paperwork involved in buying a house, and they need help. The motion gives us
  the opportunity to bring the issues forward. I am sure that the Minister will
  be able to respond to our constituents’ concerns and, it is to be hoped,
  able to bring forward ideas to address those concerns.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McNamee:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I support the
  motion, and the people who are trying to buy their first home. I declare an
  interest, as I have been an estate agent. After the next Assembly election I
  may return to that type of work. I have two children who will potentially
  become first-time buyers in the not too distant future.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion calls for the implementation of procedures to
  simplify the process, and we must identify all the bodies involved in house
  purchase. The motion deals specifically with estate agents, and I will return
  to that. However, there is a range of professionals and institutions involved
  in the house-buying process that the first-time buyer has to deal with.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First-time buyers face a major challenge in dealing with
  estate agents, banks, building societies, financial institutions, conveyancers,
  solicitors, financial advisers, life assurance companies, insurance companies,
  valuers and surveyors, all of whom have two things in common. First, they cost
  the purchaser money, and, secondly, they use esoteric, incomprehensible
  terminology that would put anyone off.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Often estate agents are the first professionals with whom a
  first-time buyer comes into contact. Although many transactions with estate
  agents take place without problems, buyers can experience difficulties in
  their dealings with them. Although a first-time buyer might have viewed a
  property, decided to buy it, made an offer, paid a deposit, reached the
  &quot;sale agreed&quot; stage and dealt with the other professionals who are
  needed to secure the purchase, the estate agent may later tell him or her that
  someone else has bought, or agreed to buy, the property, or that the price has
  increased.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree that the activity of estate agents must be
  regulated to prevent gazumping, in particular. The Assembly should consider
  introducing a requirement that estate agents issue an offer-acceptance
  certificate when a deposit is paid for the purchase of a property. That
  certificate should identify clearly the property, the price that was agreed,
  the deposit paid and the fact that the sale was agreed. At present a
  &quot;sale agreed&quot; sign means nothing, and, until the contract is signed
  and completed, the estate agent or the vendor can withdraw from the sale. The
  estate agent, the purchaser and the vendor should sign the certificate so that
  when a purchaser pays a deposit, the vendor will be bound to a sale, subject
  to the finance and property title being in order.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The real challenge begins when first-time buyers go to see
  a financial adviser. They are bombarded with financial and insurance
  terminology. They must choose between capital repayment or endowment
  mortgages; fixed-rate or variable-rate mortgages; one-year discount mortgages,
  with or without payment protection; and term assurance, with or without
  critical illness cover, and with or without accident cover. Then they will
  hear a spiel about endowment policies, unit-linked funds, trust-managed funds,
  index-linked premiums, loan-devalue percentages and indemnity premiums. After
  that they must choose home and contents insurance, with or without accidental
  cover, with or without voluntary excess, and with or without an annual value
  adjustment. That is off-putting to all but the strong-hearted. I imagine that
  most people leave their financial adviser’s office knowing much less about
  the house-buying process than they did when they arrived. A message must be
  sent to financial advisers and everyone involved in the process that they must
  speak in plain English, especially to the first-time buyer.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Solicitors must also speak in simple language. They use
  terminology such as title searches, way leaves, rights of way and
  encumbrances. Often they will talk about everything except their fees, and
  there is a wide disparity in the charges of different solicitors for doing the
  same basic job. Someone once told me that an expert is an ordinary man away
  from home. However, an expert in any field is someone who can explain a
  difficult, complicated concept or procedure in plain English. All the
  professionals involved in a house purchase must speak to their clients in
  plain English or nó as Gaeilge más mian leo.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposer of the motion mentioned some of the possible
  financial concessions that could be made for first-time buyers. The South
  operates a scheme that provides a grant to genuine first-time buyers. The
  Assembly should consider the provision of such a grant for genuine first-time
  buyers that would at least cover the fees that they face when purchasing a
  house.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Stamp duty is a significant bill. In the current housing
  market, £75,000 is considered a fairly modest price for a property. However,
  a property at that price has a stamp duty of £750. As Sir John Gorman
  indicated, that is a significant bill for a young married couple who are
  venturing into buying their first home. Stamp duty should be abolished for
  first-time buyers.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most financial institutions require a mortgage applicant to
  be in full-time permanent employment for a period of time prior to making the
  application, which is usually three years. Many people are employed on
  12-month contracts. They may be employed by the same body and may be doing the
  same job for several years, but technically they are not in full-time
  permanent employment. It is extremely difficult — sometimes impossible —
  for them to be accepted for a mortgage. Indeed, some local authorities,
  Government Departments and agencies employ people, directly or indirectly, on
  12-month contracts. The Assembly must examine the terms and conditions of
  people in that type of employment so that they can engage in the
  house-purchasing process and be eligible for a mortgage.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to join with other Members in welcoming the
  motion. Mr McNamee spoke &quot;from the horse’s mouth&quot;, as an expert.
  It was valuable to hear about the problems that are associated with the
  housing-buying system that he, as a former estate agent, understood.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The major issue concerns the host of organisations that are
  involved in the process and the associated problems. Mr McNamee mentioned all
  the different interests — estate agents, banks, solicitors, financial
  institutions, surveyors, and so on. There are also problems with the process:
  the type of mortgage — endowment or capital repayment; completion dates,
  which Mr Shannon mentioned; and the definition of fixtures and fittings, which
  has not yet been mentioned. People are unsure about the definition of fixtures
  and fittings. Carpets and curtains form part of the parcel that few people
  understand fully, even those who buy houses and move regularly, and more
  especially first-time buyers.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Gazumping can happen after a prospective buyer has agreed a
  sale, had a survey conducted, waited four to six weeks for legal issues to be
  resolved, and signed a contract. The prospective buyer will have spent money
  on the survey and on paying for lawyers for either party. At any time until
  the end point, before the transaction is binding, there is little to stop the
  seller from accepting another offer. Every Member who has spoken in the debate
  has mentioned that issue. The procedure is not clear and it must be made more
  transparent. A buyer should not have to risk so much before the transaction is
  binding.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that the seller’s pack, mentioned by Mr
  ONeill and advocated by the General Consumer Council for Northern Ireland, is
  investigated because it could protect the consumer. The onus would then be on
  the seller to provide standard information and a house condition report.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would reduce financial risk and the time between
  agreement and sale. Estate agents will be interested in that, because they see
  themselves as having a pretty bad reputation in the marketplace and would like
  it to be enhanced. It would be very valuable if the four- to six-week period
  — or longer — could be reduced.</p>
  <i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.00 pm</p>
  </i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Éamonn ONeill made an interesting point about the right of
  access to bidding books. Jim Shannon mentioned bidding: who bids against whom,
  and whether there are fictitious bidders. The facility to examine bidding
  books would be valuable. The seller’s pack must be reliable and regulated so
  that it meets the standard, and house condition reports should be objective.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The regulation of estate agents is important because of
  their growing number. New estate agents have been springing up all over the
  market in recent years. I do not know how important it is that houses can be
  bought on the Internet. Nothing should stop that new form of transaction, but
  online buying must be regulated.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The industry is policed by the Office of Fair Trading, but
  is largely self-regulating. There must be some sort of independent complaints
  procedure. The UK Ombudsman For Estate Agents is a voluntary scheme, and 36%
  of UK estate agents subscribe to it. The possibility of requiring all estate
  agents to subscribe to an independent complaints procedure, such as an
  ombudsman, is worth exploring. If Northern Ireland is to have its own
  procedures, do we need an ombudsman, or would the UK ombudsman take Northern
  Ireland estate agents under his control?</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly or the Department may have a role in
  monitoring and regularly reviewing the effectiveness of any complaints
  procedure. If the industry cannot regulate itself to the satisfaction of the
  consumer — which is the ultimate objective — we must create some type of
  complaints system, perhaps on a statutory footing, to give the consumer
  confidence.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful to Sir John Gorman for raising the issue of
  social mix housing, which is very important for first-time buyers. The fact
  that Housing Executive property is being sold off should not be neglected. Sir
  John talked about having estates and new developments with a social mix, with
  houses that are accessible to first-time buyers and to the less well off. They
  have no opportunity to get into the market otherwise. I support the motion.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister for Social Development (Mr Dodds): </b>I
  congratulate Mr ONeill on initiating the debate. It has been very useful, and
  some issues highlighted are of concern to constituents. The motion is
  wide-ranging and involves several Departments: not just the Department for
  Social Development. Members who contributed to the debate will appreciate that
  I am wearing my ministerial hat and do not have all the answers — I would
  never claim that anyway, but it is particularly true for this subject. I will
  ensure that any points that fall to other Departments are responded to in
  writing.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion covers three topics: the home-buying process,
  the regulation of estate agents and the need to assist first-time buyers. As
  several Members noted, buying a home is a stressful event. For most people, it
  is the single biggest financial transaction that they will ever carry out. In
  Northern Ireland, where home ownership stands at approximately 70%, many
  people have first-hand experience of buying a house. It has been pointed out
  that buying a home is not only stressful, but time consuming and complex. For
  that reason, my Department and the Housing Executive jointly funded the
  General Consumer Council’s report ‘Improving the house buying process’.
  That report, which was launched almost two years ago to the day, made several
  recommendations. I commend the report to those Members who have participated
  in the debate. Those recommendations were aimed at enhancing the buying
  process, and at protecting buyers and sellers. The report contained
  recommendations addressed to Government, to the professions and to the
  industry in general. My Department actively encouraged other Departments to
  embrace the report’s recommendations and, where possible, to adopt them as
  policy. I am pleased that many proposals were taken on board.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several initiatives have been introduced to speed up the
  home-buying process. For example, the Department of the Environment’s
  Planning Service has computerised and centralised its property certificates
  section. Before that, a request for a property certificate took at least six
  weeks to process; 95% of all transactions are now completed inside 10 working
  days.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Needless to say, Land Registry has a vital role to play. It
  is currently involved in a PFI project to computerise its systems and
  archives. That project, LandWeb Direct, will transform the agency’s entire
  operation, and will include the digitising of maps into a geographical
  information system, providing image retrieval and workflow processes, building
  computerised archive services and integrating the management of customer
  telephone calls, faxes and e-mails.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice mooted Internet use, et cetera. The LandWeb
  Direct service marks the first stage in providing land registry services
  online, and will become available later in 2002. It will enable accredited
  users, such as solicitors and estate agents, to access Land Registry
  information electronically from their own offices. The service will also be
  available outside normal working hours, and it will be of particular benefit
  to customers in more remote areas.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The General Consumer Council’s report recommended that
  the seller of a property should assemble a pack of such standard documents and
  information for prospective buyers as title documents and a house condition
  report, to be known as a seller’s information pack. Several Members
  mentioned that. That recommendation was based on developments in Great
  Britain, where the idea was the subject of a major pilot study in Bristol.
  Since the study’s completion there have been mixed reactions. One major area
  of concern was the house condition survey, which, it was felt, might not be of
  sufficient detail to satisfy the potential purchaser and — perhaps more
  importantly — the potential purchaser’s lender. There were also concerns
  about the price of the seller’s information pack, which could cost more than
  £500. Since the seller’s information pack for the Bristol study was
  produced at nil cost, it was suggested that that did not give a true
  reflection of its advantages or disadvantages.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We continue to monitor developments in Great Britain, where
  the specific details of the proposals for the seller’s information pack are
  now being developed. Publication of a consultation document in the summer of
  2002 is proposed.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several issues must be considered before the seller’s
  information pack can become a legal requirement. Therefore, it makes sense for
  us to maintain a watching brief in order to learn from the experience of Great
  Britain. Meanwhile, I am confident that the changes already made, and those
  that are proposed, will considerably improve and simplify the house-buying
  process in Northern Ireland. It is important to bear in mind Mr ONeill’s
  point that account must be taken of Northern Ireland’s specific needs. We
  must learn from practice and experience elsewhere, while addressing
  specifically what must be done in Northern Ireland.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a difficulty in the seller’s information pack
  with the surveyor’s report. Can a potential purchaser have confidence in a
  surveyor’s report prepared for the seller? We do not want a situation in
  which both buyer and seller feel compelled to have a surveyor’s report.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second aspect of the motion calls for the regulation of
  estate agents. It has been suggested that an ombudsman for estate agents be
  established. In Northern Ireland, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and
  Investment is responsible for enforcing the Estate Agents Act 1979 and the
  Property Misdescriptions Act 1991. The Estate Agents Act 1979 gives
  enforcement powers to the Director General of Fair Trading, and its purpose is
  to ensure that estate agents act in the best interests of their clients and
  that buyers and sellers are treated fairly, honestly and promptly.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment is
  responsible for ensuring that estate agents comply with certain financial
  transactions between estate agents and house buyers and in particular ensure
  the safe keeping of deposits.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under the Estate Agents Act 1979, the Director General of
  Fair Trading can issue warning and prohibition orders that can stop a person
  working as an estate agent. A warning order can also be issued if an estate
  agent breaks the law by, for example, making misleading statements, giving
  false information on charges or providing clients with misinformation about
  offers. A prohibition order can be issued if an estate agent breeches a
  warning order or is convicted of a serious offence such as fraud, other
  dishonesty or violence.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Property Misdescriptions Act 1991 prohibits the use of
  false or misleading statements, made in the course of estate agency business,
  that relate to certain matters such as location or address, aspect, view,
  outlook or environment and fixtures and fittings. That legislation gives the
  Director General of Fair Trading much stronger powers than an ombudsman would
  have.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the past three years, fewer than 1% of the complaints
  received by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment’s consumer
  affairs branch related to estate agents. In the same period, no estate agent
  was prosecuted, nor were any warning or prohibition orders issued to estate
  agents in Northern Ireland. It is, therefore, that Department’s view that
  the present legislation to regulate estate agents is sufficiently robust, and
  it has no immediate plans to amend it. The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and
  Investment will read Members’ comments about that.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members commented on the need to make financial concessions
  available to first-time buyers. As the Minister responsible for housing, my
  vision is one of a society in which everybody has a home that is safe,
  affordable, in the area of his or her choice, of an acceptable quality and
  designed to meet the needs of its occupants. The media regularly report on the
  rising house prices here and the difficulty that that causes first-time
  buyers. Much of that reporting is fuelled by recent problems in the South of
  England and the Republic of Ireland, where house prices increased dramatically
  in a short time.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">House prices in Northern Ireland have risen. In recent
  years, those increases have been considerably higher than the increases in
  other parts of the United Kingdom. However, it must be borne in mind that our
  increases started from a much lower baseline. For many years, house prices
  here were significantly lower than in the rest of the United Kingdom, so in
  some respects there is a catch-up process.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The ratio between house prices and wages remains relatively
  healthy in Northern Ireland. Although some areas have localised affordability
  issues, particularly in parts of Belfast and north Down, home ownership
  remains a viable option for most prospective first-time buyers.</p>
  <i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.15 pm</p>
  </i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir John Gorman mentioned the idea of making planning
  applications conditional on the provision of affordable housing. That is a
  matter for the Department for Regional Development, and was addressed in the
  regional strategic framework.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware that the situation must be monitored carefully,
  particularly with regard to first-time buyers. I want to do whatever I can to
  ensure that those who wish to become homeowners have the opportunity to do so.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The co-ownership scheme was mentioned, and I agree with Mr
  ONeill about its popularity, value and usefulness. Since becoming Minister, I
  have made co-ownership one of my top priorities. I have made available
  considerable additional funding to ensure that the scheme can meet growing
  demand, and in the last financial year, I doubled the allocation for
  co-ownership — from £5 million to £10 million. I have made a commitment in
  the Programme for Government to continue to fund this important programme.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Housing Executive sales programme is an important
  method of getting people into the housing market, and that also applies to
  Housing Association tenants. Financial and lending institutions have a major
  role to play, and I have built up close contacts with their representative
  body, the Council of Mortgage Lenders.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the end of the day, we have a free market, and we must
  recognise that there are limits to what the Government can do. We are
  conscious of the situation and will continue to monitor it closely.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Members who participated in and gave their
  attention to this debate — some good points were made. Regrettably we had
  only an hour, and Members who may have wished to participate but did not have
  time. However, the quality of the contributions reflects the concern that
  Members have about this serious situation.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">John Gorman, with his wealth of experience and wisdom, drew
  attention to several important issues, and I welcome his comments. When we
  studied the situation with the Minister in the South, he explored a policy
  that he had of zoning certain land for social housing, although not
  necessarily for affordability. He said that regardless of what he did, there
  were problems, such as developers wanting to maximise the best part of the
  site and not use the rest. Although there are difficulties with that approach,
  it is a sound suggestion. It is important that we get the right mix and ensure
  that all developments offer a range of housing and house prices.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jim Shannon dealt with a large number of important issues.
  He expressed concern about the bidding process. Access to the bidding book,
  which Jane Morrice also mentioned, is important, as it ensures that people
  have confidence in the process. That is part of the policy of transparency
  that I hope an ombudsman would propose.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jim Shannon also referred to the delay and problems people
  experience in agreeing completion dates, and the fact that buying a house can
  be a long-drawn-out process. Along with Pat McNamee and other Members, he
  hinted at the delay that the legal process can cause. We must help to simplify
  that process, particularly for the first-time buyer. The long-drawn-out
  process is difficult for them, as they have to negotiate to put together the
  financial package and loans that they need. We must consider how to reduce the
  time that that takes and put a better formulation together.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was interested in Pat McNamee’s practical comments. He
  emphasised the effect of jargon on first-time buyers, for whom that language
  is totally alien. He painted a picture of a jungle of jargon, and he is right
  to say that we must reduce it. That is exactly what I was trying to get at in
  the motion.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jane Morrice came up with a good point about Internet
  selling, which I had not thought of. This is actually growing, and I came
  across some information on the growth of Internet sales in the work I was
  doing. Like other things, it is quite difficult to control Internet buying and
  selling. I know of emigrants wishing to return home who are using the Internet
  to purchase properties in Northern Ireland. There is a real problem there, and
  Ms Morrice made an important contribution.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also thank the Minister for becoming involved in this. I
  recognise that not every issue here falls within his particular bailiwick, but
  as the lead Minister I can depend on him to expedite those points that do not
  belong to him through the various agencies. The Minister gave a good rundown
  on what has been done in support for the General Consumer Council’s
  proposals and the simplification of the house-buying process.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He expressed some concerns about the seller’s pack that
  have emerged from the pilot scheme in Bristol, and he is right to do so.
  Indeed, there are some other points about the seller’s pack that we need to
  take into consideration — not least its shelf life. That could actually
  accrue an extra cost because there is only three to six months before another
  valuation is needed. I welcome his emphasis on the need for Northern Ireland,
  which he did in his summary. I still think that there is sufficient merit in
  the proposal of a seller’s pack and in this simplification of the process
  that we are all trying to achieve.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My final point is about estate agencies. I welcome the
  Minister’s comments about financial support and control. To a large extent
  he may be right about professional, inbuilt safeguards — but it is in-house.
  We are looking for a more independent agency, such as an ombudsman or an
  ombudsman-type service. People would have confidence going to the ombudsman
  because they would not be baffled by jargon and science. People would know
  that they would get satisfaction with an established, transparent procedure.</p>

  </b></center>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font SIZE="3"><a href="#top">TOP</a></font>
  </p>
  <center>
  <b>
  <font SIZE="3">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Douglas:</p>
  </font></b><font SIZE="3">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When I first put in for this Adjournment debate, my voice
  was a bit stronger. I hope you will forgive me if I take a drink of water now
  and again to clear my throat. With that in mind, perhaps my comments will be
  brief.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I bring forward this debate on the closure of Limavady
  courthouse following publication of a consultation document titled ‘Court
  Accommodation in Northern Ireland 2001-2010’, which deals with the
  accommodation needs of the Court Service for the next eight years n Northern
  Ireland. More specifically for people in the Limavady area, it proposes the
  closure of Limavady courthouse. This recommendation has caused great
  consternation in the borough of Limavady. Indeed, a petition bearing over
  1,000 signatures and expressing opposition to this proposal has been presented
  to officials in Downing Street. The people of Limavady believe that this
  facility is vital.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A proposal to close the courthouse would contradict the
  comments of Rosie Winterton, a parliamentary secretary at the Lord Chancellor’s
  Department, that appear in the foreword to the consultation document. She said
  that the Northern Ireland Court Service wished to address the needs of
  everyone who used the courts, especially those with special needs,
  disabilities and children, and vulnerable or intimidated witnesses. Such
  people would be better served by a court in an area that they know well and in
  which they feel comfortable.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Londonderry courthouse is the alternative venue that is
  offered. Although that courthouse’s merits are in no doubt, given its recent
  refurbishment, Limavady courthouse also served the people of Londonderry
  during many years of sectarian strife, when the IRA targeted constantly
  Londonderry courthouse at Bishop Street, frequently rendering it unusable. If
  the Northern Ireland Court Service had consulted before publishing its
  document, solutions could have been proposed, at minimal cost, to provide the
  amenities that the Limavady facility lacked. The document seems to leave
  little room for manoeuvre; its authors seem to want it rubber-stamped even as
  it is published.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The other considerations for the Court Service are
  rationalisation and value for money; however, raw figures often do not give
  the true picture. The increased cost to the public of making the longer
  journey to Londonderry for court hearings, combined with the increased cost of
  legal aid and higher levels of policing, must also be considered.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The estimated saving of £300,000 in running costs, which
  would be made as a result of the closure, must be put into context. People
  should balance that saving against the costs of the many public inquiries that
  are taking place in the Province, which could fund the entire Northern Ireland
  Court Service many times over. Moreover, the expenses that will be paid to the
  Sinn Féin MPs at Westminster, despite their not taking their seats, could
  offset those court savings with £100,000 to spare. We must be realistic, and
  we should emphasise those points to the Government as often as possible,
  despite their current policy of placating and appeasing the lawbreakers at the
  expense of the decent, law-abiding citizens of this country.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given that the Borough of Limavady has above-average
  unemployment levels, high levels of deprivation, many single parent families
  and low levels of educational achievement, many of the increased costs that
  would result from the closure would be intolerable. The Limavady area has felt
  a cold wind blow through it due to the so-called &quot;peace dividend&quot;.
  Over the years, it provided vital court services in a reasonably safe venue.
  It also provided a home for many Court Service and police personnel. The town
  is feeling the effects of the loss of vital funds from those sources, along
  with the loss of traditional industry from the town. The further loss of the
  courthouse gives local people the impression that they are being treated as
  second-class citizens — that is disgraceful. Over the years, the people of
  Limavady have been among the most law-abiding citizens in the Province, making
  up much of the silent majority of decent people here. Consequently, it is
  fundamentally wrong that they should be subjected to wave after wave of public
  and private service closures that further downgrade the town.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly and the Executive have put in place a policy
  of rural proofing, which is being disregarded in the centralisation of many
  court facilities in the Province — not least the facility in Limavady, which
  is predominantly a rural borough. Many Members have pressed for the
  decentralisation of Civil Service jobs, which would result in rural
  invigoration by bringing more money into country areas. Although
  rationalisation is being carried out under the control of central Government,
  regional variances should be considered when formulating policies.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those factors should be considered in conjunction with the
  fact that the natural affinity of the people of the area is more in keeping
  with the rest of the rural county of Londonderry rather than the city itself.</p>
  <i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.30 pm</p>
  </i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many are loath to go to the west bank under normal
  circumstances, and more so when they are anxious about an impending court
  appearance. The fear and trepidation are such that people from the Waterside
  area of Londonderry would rather go to Limavady for their service than travel
  to the west bank of the city. Those are real concerns for decent people, and
  they should be addressed rather than ignored because it is inconvenient to do
  otherwise.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Court Service must re-examine the proposal, and come to
  Limavady to view the facility to see if the unused accommodation can be
  upgraded to meet people’s needs. That might have already happened.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The document shows that the Magherafelt facility, which is
  also poor, will be upgraded due to its position. That should happen in
  Limavady because of the fear of travelling to Londonderry.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must not have an inadequate, unjust evaluation imposed
  upon the people of the Borough of Limavady simply because that is expedient.
  There would be additional delays in hearing cases if they were moved to
  Londonderry courthouse. The court at Bishop Street is already working to
  capacity, and people from the whole area would face even greater delays and
  attendant worries.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Such a situation would be totally unacceptable and must not
  be allowed to happen. The Limavady facility should be upgraded and used more
  effectively to ease court time in Londonderry, thus speeding up the system in
  the division.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McClarty:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. It has been tabled as a result of the
  Northern Ireland Court Service’s consultation document ‘Court
  Accommodation in Northern Ireland 2001-2010’, which was launched in December
  of last year with the aim of charting the future of court accommodation in
  Northern Ireland.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The strategy proposes the rationalisation of courthouses,
  with the closure of several courts that are deemed to be inadequate. Venues to
  be closed include the court facilities in Banbridge, Larne, Clogher, Kilkeel,
  Cookstown and Limavady. It is envisaged that business will transfer to
  adjoining venues. Limavady’s business will be transferred to Londonderry
  courthouse.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The review of court accommodation in Northern Ireland by
  the Court Service aims at improving the quality of court accommodation for
  court users. A press release issued by the Northern Ireland Court Service on 7
  December 2001 stated that particular emphasis would be given to</p>
  </font><font SIZE="1">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;those members of the community who have special needs
  including persons with disabilities, children, and vulnerable and intimidated
  witnesses.&quot;</p>
  </font><font SIZE="3">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other Members may wish to speak about court closures in
  their constituencies; I shall highlight the imminent closure of Limavady
  courthouse.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Limavady courthouse is one of three court complexes in the
  Londonderry county court division. The others are located in Magherafelt and
  Londonderry. There are seven county court divisions in Northern Ireland, and
  the nearest major court complex to Limavady is Coleraine courthouse, which is
  within the boundary of the Antrim court division.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are compelling reasons for rescinding the decision to
  close Limavady court. First, the closure of the courthouse would result in
  discrimination on the grounds of geography. Limavady lies in the north-east of
  the Londonderry court division. Transferring court proceedings to Londonderry
  would increase journey times unnecessarily and would be excessively expensive.
  Some of those who use the court system are among the less economically
  privileged. Financially, many of them would find it a strain to travel the
  extra 20 or 30 miles. What about the people mentioned earlier — parents with
  young children, the disabled and the vulnerable? How will the closure of
  Limavady courthouse affect them?</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, Limavady is not a blink-and-you-have-missed-it
  village. It is a thriving town, which has grown substantially in recent years.
  It has a busy commercial core, with good tourist facilities and international
  branding, and it is getting a major infrastructure improvement, a bypass, to
  accommodate excess traffic.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The town has a distinctive identity and catchment area. It
  is bounded geographically by the Roe Valley to the west and a mountain plateau
  to the east. By virtue of its geography, Limavady has a distinct catchment
  area and rural hinterland, and people living there would find it alien to have
  to use court services elsewhere in the Londonderry county court division. The
  fact that the town is in the county court division is a good reason for
  repelling the threat of closure.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The courthouse, which is sited in the centre of Limavady,
  has provided the town with a raison d’être, a sense of purposefulness,
  character and employment for many years. Surely small funds could be
  channelled to any refurbishment programme deemed necessary to provide the
  judiciary and the public with modern facilities.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Northern Ireland Court Service has stated that its aim
  is</p>
  </font><font SIZE="1">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;to ensure that the people of Northern Ireland have
  the highest possible quality court accommodation that meets the needs of
  everyone who uses the courts.&quot;</p>
  </font><font SIZE="3">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is a worthy aim, which I fully support. However, that
  ought not be at the expense of ill-judged rationalisation. Small town
  courthouses have provided a sense of justice to communities for decades, if
  not centuries. Closing Limavady courthouse would be to misinterpret community
  needs and perceptions, and it would contradict the objectives of ensuring
  equality of access and quality of provision.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appeal to the Northern Ireland Court Service not to
  rationalise for the sake of expediency.</p>
  </font><font SIZE="1">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Overall, we need to provide facilities that reflect
  the dignity of the law and its importance to everyone in the community.&quot;</p>
  </font><font SIZE="3">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those are not my words. They come from the Court Service’s
  accommodation strategy document. Limavady courthouse fulfils that criterion. I
  support the motion and urge others to do likewise.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr A Doherty:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend Mr Douglas for tabling the motion. We are
  Colleagues on Limavady Borough Council as well as in the Assembly, and
  although we differ widely in our political beliefs and aspirations for the
  future of this country, we share a desire to do everything we can to protect
  and promote the well-being of our constituents. That well-being will be
  seriously compromised if the threat to close Limavady courthouse is realised.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept the case made by Limavady Solicitors’
  Association for retaining the wide range of services currently provided at the
  courthouse as well as for much needed improvement to its facilities and an
  expansion of services to include a family proceedings court. The case is made
  not just to allow the solicitors to continue to provide an efficient and cost
  effective service to their clients but to target the social needs of a mainly
  rural community, thus sparing those in need the cost and inconvenience of
  travelling a considerable distance to a large, unfamiliar and intimidating
  court that is already extremely busy.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall add another dimension to the issue with some
  trepidation, and I shall tread delicately, for I must introduce the
  controversial subject of symbols and symbolism. I am not referring to the use
  and misuse of flags and other emblems. This is a matter of great concern to
  those with a genuine commitment to civil rights and responsibilities. However,
  it is something criminally abused by the sad, bad, mad and dangerous, who
  exploit the fears and passions of people whose quality of life is so
  tragically disturbed and deprived. There is something abysmally evil about a
  society in which a young person can be killed for wearing a football jersey,
  or gangs claim some sick allegiance to extremists who are creating such misery
  in the near east.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The symbolism I am referring to is that which is created by
  some structures of the state, particularly those relating to justice and the
  law. It is a rather unfortunate coincidence that the possible closure of a
  courthouse comes at a time when predictions are rife about the shutting down
  of prisons and military installations. Prisons and courts of justice are at
  opposite ends of the spectrum. I stress the word &quot;justice&quot; rather
  than &quot;law&quot;. Justice is an absolute, but the law is sometimes an
  accident — sometimes a bad accident.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The over-prevalence of prisons, H-blocks and houses of
  correction symbolise the failure of a society — Government and people — to
  be civilised. The shutting down of prisons and armed camps is an indication
  that society is, at least, struggling away from barbarism. The economic impact
  of that on workers and the community will initially be drastic, but with
  proper insight and planning that may be temporary. A healthier and more normal
  economy is possible when conditions are right for the attraction of inward and
  indigenous investment. That is particularly so in areas such as Limavady and
  the north-west with regard to tourism development.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The symbols of prisons and militarism are all negative.
  That is not so for courts of justice, so long as true justice is being
  administered. True justice drives out bad laws. Circumstances must exist, or
  be created, in which people can be convinced that they will receive justice
  from their courts. Courts must be close to the people; they should not be
  remote and threatening. The symbolism of a court is that of a society that is,
  at least, aspiring towards civilisation in its truest sense. People must have
  a sense of ownership of the system of justice that exercises a measure of
  control over how they relate to one another in society. The preservation and
  enhancement of petty session courts, such as that in Limavady, can give them
  that sense of ownership and can be a positive influence in civilising this
  confused and unhappy place.</p>
  <b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Campbell:</p>
  </b>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. Mr Arthur Doherty referred to the
  closure of prisons, and I hope that he will be able to support the campaign to
  retain Magilligan Prison, which the Limavady area is heavily dependent on to
  keep the economy buoyant, but we will come to that on a future date.</p>
  <i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.45 pm</p>
  </i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Limavady Solicitors’ Association is to be highly
  commended for the way in which it has taken the campaign to retain the
  courthouse to the people. I want to place on record that the association has
  carried out an assiduous campaign. I was glad to be able to use my offices at
  Westminster and, in my capacity as Member of Parliament for the area, to
  ensure that the petition was delivered to Downing Street.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue has been well aired and well supported in the
  locality. The Limavady Solicitors’ Association and the greater public have
  rallied behind the campaign to retain the courthouse, and Members have spoken
  at some length about the necessity to retain it, so I do not want to duplicate
  what has been said. However, during the campaign two months ago I met with
  Rosie Winterton, the Parliamentary Secretary at the Lord Chancellor’s
  Department who is responsible for the issue.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even though the matter will be decided at Westminster, it
  is right that it be discussed in this appropriate forum. However, in
  discussions with Ms Winterton it became clear that, despite the list of
  courthouses earmarked for closure, she would be prepared to take a fresh look
  at the courthouse. To encourage that, there was a recent meeting between
  Limavady Borough Council and officials, which I had requested. The Northern
  Ireland Court Service has carried out a survey, the results of which will be
  released this week; the solicitors’ association also conducted a survey.
  Both surveys concur with the views of the area’s Members: people in Limavady
  do not wish to travel excessive distances to the nearest courthouse. In some
  parts of the constituency, as Mr Arthur Doherty will know, people would have
  to travel 25 miles to the nearest courthouse.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A chill factor affects parts of the community, and Mr
  Douglas mentioned that. However, an issue that has not been mentioned is that
  the small claims court meets in Limavady. Small claims cases by individuals or
  small businessmen can go either way, and the benefit may be offset against
  charges if the claimant loses. Solicitors in Limavady think that the number of
  small claims will fall. The burden of travel on top of the possibility of not
  winning the case will make people reluctant to go to the small claims court.
  In that case, justice would not be done and would not be seen to be done,
  because it is not available to people in the area.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other issues came up in the Court Service’s survey. The
  most important is that three quarters of the people surveyed in Limavady felt
  that they would be affected if court business were transferred to Londonderry.
  Ms Winterton and the Court Service cannot set aside a survey that states that
  three quarters of people would be adversely affected. That must be allied with
  the unanimous views of the local borough council and other public
  representatives, MLAs and the MP. I hope that the campaign to retain the
  courthouse in Limavady succeeds.</p>
