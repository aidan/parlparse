    <p class="H4StageHeading">North/South Ministerial Council: Languages</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n  (The Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann  Comhairle. Thank you, Mr Speaker. With your permission and in compliance with  section 52 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, I wish to make the following  statement on the twelfth North/South Ministerial Council (NSMC) meeting in  language sectoral format, the eighth since the restoration of the Executive and  the Assembly and the first held in 2011. This statement has been agreed with  junior Minister Bell, who was the accompanying Minister.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I attended the meeting in Armagh  on 7 July 2011 representing the Executive as Minister of Culture, Arts and  Leisure along with Jonathan Bell MLA, junior Minister in the Office of the  First Minister and deputy First Minister (OFMDFM). The Irish Government were  represented by Jimmy Deenihan TD, Minister of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht  and Dinny McGinley TD, Minister of State with special responsibility for  Gaeltacht affairs. The meeting dealt with issues relating to the language body  and its two constituent agencies, Tha Boord o Ulster-Scotch &mdash; hopefully, I  pronounced that right &mdash; and Foras na Gaeilge, the Irish language agency. I will  now present a summary of the issues that the Council discussed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council received presentations and progress reports  from Foras na Gaeilge and the Ulster-Scots Agency on the collaborative work and  other activities of the two agencies. Those include further joint development  of their lecture series &lsquo;Aspects of our Shared Heritage&rsquo; and plans to provide  evening community education lectures in conjunction with local councils; provision  of joint information stands at events such as the national ploughing  championships, the Castlewellan agricultural show and the Stormont family fun  day; the first accreditation system for Irish language editors, which was held  by Foras na Gaeilge on 25 June 2011, and the launch of new supports for the  Irish language translation sector; and approval of funding by Foras na Gaeilge  for 50 summer camps that provide valuable opportunities for children to use  Irish outside the school environment and for 47 festivals to promote the  language in the community at large. They also include the approval by the  Ulster-Scots Agency of almost 300 grants for grass-roots communities to  undertake music and dance tuition and for 32 Ulster-Scots festivals, as well as  an extension of the community workers scheme, which continues to impact  positively on Ulster-Scots activities by improving capacity in community  groups; and delivery by the Ulster-Scots Agency of a range of educational  programmes, including eight after-school clubs and 32 community summer school  schemes that will engage children and young people in Ulster-Scots language and  culture.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council discussed progress on the development of the  North/South Language Body&rsquo;s corporate plan for 2011-13 and its business plan  and budget for 2011. The Council noted that the language body&rsquo;s 2007 accounts  were laid in the Oireachtas and, indeed, in the Assembly on 10 June 2011 and  that audit fieldwork has been completed for the annual reports and accounts for  2008 and 2009. Consolidation will follow as soon as possible. Draft accounts  have been filed for 2010. The Council also noted that it is proposed to  introduce a new, simplified consolidation process as soon as possible and that  a further progress report on that will be given at the next NSMC language body  meeting.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted that all draft schemes that are required  to implement the recommendations of the review have now been drawn up.  Following consideration of comments that were made during the recent public  consultation exercise, the approval of the board and the Finance Ministers will  be sought, prior to submitting the schemes to the next meeting of the NSMC for  approval.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council agreed that, in the context of continuing to  achieve satisfactory progress, Foras na Gaeilge may continue to provide interim  funding to existing funded organisations until the end of June 2012. A further  progress report will be made at the next NSMC meeting in language sectoral  format.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted the recommendations of the review of the  Ulster-Scots Agency&rsquo;s financial assistance scheme. It agreed to hold its next  meeting in language sectoral format in October or November 2011.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss M McIlveen  (The Chairperson of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure)</strong>: I note  that the Council proposes to introduce a new, simplified, consolidated process  for publication of the language body&rsquo;s annual accounts and report. Can the  Minister be much more specific about the timetable for delivery of that process  and give assurances that there will be no future delay in the publication of  accounts and reports?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  I thank the Member for her question. The issue was raised by my predecessor,  her party colleague Nelson McCausland. The lengthy and arduous accounting  process is due to the fact that there are two jurisdictions, two sets of  accounting procedures and two Finance Ministers. The overall audit trail has  caused considerable delay. Consolidation is the way to proceed. We anticipate  that consolidation will be defined by the next language sectoral meeting.  Thereafter, there should be a consolidated process, which will make accounting  much quicker and easier. It will certainly benefit both organisations in  question.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McMullan</strong>:  Are the Ulster-Scots Agency&rsquo;s staffing arrangements appropriate to its needs?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Sorry. Can the Member repeat the question?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I ask the Member to repeat his question.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McMullan</strong>:  Sorry. Are the Ulster-Scots Agency&rsquo;s staffing arrangements appropriate to its  needs?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  In short, the answer is yes. A review of the agency&rsquo;s staffing structure was  carried out in 2009 and, again, in September 2010. The review identified the  most appropriate senior structure for the agency, including job descriptions.  Indeed, descriptions for senior roles, with the associated level of grading,  have been achieved. They will include specifications of the staff knowledge and  skill sets that are required for each role.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Swann</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her statement. She mentioned the provision of joint  information stands at events such as the national ploughing championships and  the Stormont family fun day. Can she give details of other events at which  those stands might be present and how costs will be borne out and apportioned  between the two bodies?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Quite a list of events has taken place as well as those proposed, and I am  happy to furnish the Member with the details, including the costs. I do not  have details of the costs here. There is a list that is too long to read out,  but I am happy to furnish the Member with all the details as requested. The  joint approach by both agencies to get information out about their work is to  be welcomed, and further activities of that nature can certainly be achieved  with more joined-up working.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as  an r&aacute;iteas at&aacute; s&iacute; i ndiaidh a dh&eacute;anamh. Ba mhaith liom a fhiafra&iacute; den Aire ar  phl&eacute;igh s&iacute; an tionscnamh &ldquo;L&iacute;ofa&rdquo; ag an chruinni&uacute; chomhaireachta agus ar  smaoinigh s&iacute; ar an tionscnamh a chur ar f&aacute;il ar bhonn uile-oile&aacute;nda faoi Fhoras  na Gaeilge, &oacute; is eagra&iacute;ocht &iacute; a bhfuil a Roinn f&eacute;in ina hurra uirthi.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Did the Minister discuss the L&iacute;ofa project at the  North/South Ministerial Council? Has she considered delivering it on an  all-island basis through Foras na Gaeilge, which is an organisation that her  Department sponsors?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  I thank the Member for his question. As he can see from the statement, L&iacute;ofa is  not mentioned. If L&iacute;ofa had been discussed at the meeting, it would have been  mentioned in the statement. I am happy to discuss L&iacute;ofa in further detail with  the Member at the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure on Thursday. In  short, L&iacute;ofa is just being taken forward by my Department. Foras na Gaeilge is  assisting with that. We just need to see what way the programme develops and  what the uptake is before deciding on where to go with it and what to do with  it in future.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>:  From a quick count in the statement, there are about 450 separate events, which  is terrific and is great activity by both organisations. Does the Minister have  any figures for what all this costs? What is the level of funding to each  organisation, and are there any plans to make them more self-sustaining?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  I thank the Member for his question. I will furnish all Members with the list  of activities that happened and the associated costs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Needless to say, both organisations have funded the  programmes from their budgets. The sustaining of such activities, particularly  when they promote good and better relations throughout the island, is to be  welcomed, and others, should they be from the private sector or other agencies,  could lend themselves to such work and take some of the cost burden. I do not  have all the definitive details at hand, but I am happy to furnish the Member  and others with them.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Irwin</strong>:  Will the Minister provide more detail on the recommendations of the review of  the Ulster-Scots Agency&rsquo;s financial assistance scheme?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  To be honest, I do not have all the detail at hand. However, the Member is  probably aware that there were three categories that the review concentrated  on, namely, agency level, cross-cutting group level and specific group level.  Some of the key recommendations relating to those categories are quite  extensive, but, to give the Member a flavour of them, they include provision of  strategic guidance to the groups through the development of a strategy for the  sector and the agency ensuring that each of the groups delivers to an  appropriate action plan.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The recommendations are with the Finance Minister for  approval, but the agency was consulted throughout the review, so it will not be  a case of imposing something on anyone.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr &Oacute; hOis&iacute;n</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as  a r&aacute;iteas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">How will any recommendations from the review of Foras na  Gaeilge impact on core-funded groups in the North?</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  I thank the Member for his question. The review of Foras na Gaeilge and  core-funded bodies has generated a lot of interest, and there is a lot of  concern. Officials from both sponsoring Departments have worked and will  continue to work with Foras na Gaeilge to agree the detail of the review&rsquo;s  proposals and a timescale for their implementation. The well-documented need  for continued consultation in that sector was highlighted, and that work is  being progressed. In that context and as mentioned in previous answers, the  extensive nature of the review is the reason why we have proposed extending  funding for Foras na Gaeilge and the language body until June 2012. That will  help them to achieve the recommendations of the review and to work with the  groups that are directly affected by that review. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hilditch</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her statement. Given the many pressures that are on  some of our other services, will the Minister indicate what, if any, good  housekeeping measures were discussed at the meeting? Members heard of similar  measures being taken in some of the other North/South bodies during yesterday&rsquo;s  statements by other Ministers.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  If the Member is referring to governance and efficiency, my response is that  statements have been made by Mr Jimmy Deenihan TD about the pressures on the  Irish Government&rsquo;s Budget. There has been much speculation on the back of those  statements, but no decisions have yet been taken. Minister Deenihan and I have  planned a series of meetings between sectoral meetings to look at efficiencies,  governance, projects and better delivery, and those meetings are particularly  important given the financial constraints that we all face. In addition,  Minister Deenihan and I have agreed to work together and with both Finance  Ministers to help to achieve those efficiencies.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  I will follow on from the previous question. Bearing in mind the financial  constraints that the health service, in particular, is facing and the  difficulties that it is rapidly getting into, is it not appalling for the  language body to have an accounting process in which the accounts for 2007 were  laid only in June of this year and for which a consolidation process is now  being proposed?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In her statement, the Minister outlined the introduction  of:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;a new simplified consolidation process as soon as  possible&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Will she tell me on what date approximately that  will be implemented? What does &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo; mean when trying to get  some sort of financial discipline into that reporting?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  I think that we could all agree that it is appalling that the Member for South Belfast is still playing politics with health. As  to the consolidation of the accounts, the next meeting in language sectoral  format is scheduled for 13 October, and I anticipate being able to confirm a  specific date soon after that. Consolidation is about making the process easier  and ensuring that people across the island can understand the workings of both  bodies, how their accounts are compiled and what the money is spent on. Given  the Member&rsquo;s background, I would have thought that he would welcome that,  rather than pouring water on the fact that people are trying to be more  accountable and transparent. Well done &mdash; you are consistent anyway.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McKevitt</strong>:  Will the Minister provide to Members the results of the equality impact  screening exercise on the core-funded Irish language organisations?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  I am happy to do that. As far as I am aware, the results of that equality  impact assessment have been published. However, I will check and make sure that  they have.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McKevitt</strong>:  They have not been published.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  OK. I will make sure that they are.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hale</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her statement. Is she able to elaborate on the extension  of the community workers scheme, which continues to impact positively on  Ulster-Scots activities by improving capacity in community groups?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  There is quite a lot of detail on that in the statement, and quite a lot of  work has been done by the Ulster-Scots Agency in that area. I am on record as  having said that it is to be welcomed that that body changed the direction of  its funding and took money from marketing, for example, and put it into the  community. There is plenty of detail about the schemes. There are over 300 such  schemes, including after-school programmes. If she wants to know anything  specific, I will forward the information to the Member and all Members.  However, separate to what I have outlined in the statement, I could be reading  this out for the next 10 minutes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  Considering that the Minister did not even know that the core funding review  had not been equality impact assessed, which is quite appalling for a Minister,  I do not have much confidence in seeking any information from her. However, I  will take the focus back to the appalling failure of financial management in  relation to the Irish language bodies, which took from 2007 to 2011 to produce  accounts. The Minister may not be appalled by that, but I suspect that the  taxpayers who fund these quangos will most certainly be appalled. Does she not  recognise that that is exactly the sort of issue that drains confidence from  any public body and causes one to question why we are pouring money into these  useless, non-productive quangos?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I ask the Member to come to his question, please.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  I detected a statement rather than a question. If the Member wants to write to  me, I am happy to answer his question. He actually writes to me quite a lot  every day. Jim and I have become firm friends. If he asks a specific question,  I will be happy to answer him.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Is it in order for a Minister to mislead the  House by suggesting that I wrote to her the other day &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  &mdash; when I write consistently to the permanent secretary?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. I ask the Member to take his seat.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Salving your conscience.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Let me say to the Member &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.] </span>Order. The  Member should take his seat.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  You should be the last man to talk about conscience. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. Let me say this to the Member: using that type of language is very  unparliamentary. I warn the Member about accusing any Minister of misleading  the House. I warn the Member. The Member should remain in his seat. Let us move  on to the next item of business.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  On a point of order &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. I am moving on.</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="2"></a>North/South Ministerial Council: &nbsp;Inland Waterways</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have been informed by the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure that she  wishes to make a second statement to the House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n  (The Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann  Comhairle. Mr Speaker, with your permission, I wish to make a statement in  compliance with section 52 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 regarding a meeting  of the North/South Ministerial Council in inland waterways sectoral format. The  meeting was held in Armagh on 7 July 2011.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive were represented by me as Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure and junior Minister Jonathan Bell from the Office of  the First and deputy First Minister. The Irish Government were represented by  Jimmy Deenihan TD, Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. The statement  has been agreed with junior Minister Bell, and I make it on behalf of us both.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council received a presentation and progress report  from the chief executive of Waterways Ireland on its work, including the  following significant achievements: the provision of 484 metres of additional  moorings, of which 84 metres have been provided at Castle Hume in County  Fermanagh; the sponsorship programme that is under way, with over 70 events  being sponsored across all navigations; the provision of new publications to  promote and support the use of the waterways; the completion of a number of  product development studies involving relevant tourism authorities and local  authorities with the aims of defining the future needs and future investment in  the waterways from a navigational, recreational and tourism perspective;  progress on the EU INTERREG IVc Waterways Forward project with 17 partners from  13 countries, which will include Waterways Ireland hosting a meeting of all  parties from 13 to 16 September 2011; and the Lakelands and Inland Waterways  initiative and a marketing campaign for the Erne-Shannon system, which  continued in this period.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council discussed progress on the development of the  Waterways Ireland corporate plan 2011-2013 and business plan and budget 2011.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council received a progress report on the restoration  work for the Clones to Upper Lough Erne section of the Ulster canal.  Ministers noted that a preferred route had been identified and a preliminary  design is now well developed. It was noted that planning would be applied for  in both jurisdictions in summer 2011. Work on the strategic environmental  assessment and plan has been completed and published, and work on the  environmental impact assessment is ongoing. Waterways Ireland has  held meetings with all relevant public authorities to advise them on the  project.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted the Waterways Ireland annual report and  draft accounts for 2010. The annual report and accounts will be laid before the  Assembly and both Houses of the Oireachtas following the accounts&rsquo;  certification. The Council consented to a number of property disposals, all in  the South of Ireland, and agreed to meet again in inland waterways sectoral  format in October/November 2011.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss M McIlveen  (Chairperson of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure)</strong>: What  assurance can the Minister give following the July NSMC meeting that the full  costs of the works from Clones to Upper Lough Erne can be met and are on course  for completion, given press speculation that this project may be the casualty of  budget cuts by the Irish Republic&rsquo;s Government?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  I mentioned this in my previous statement. The Member is right: there has been  quite a lot of speculation in the press about concerns around constraints on  the Irish Government&rsquo;s ability to meet the full costs of the restoration of the  Ulster  canal, particularly from Minister Jimmy Deenihan TD. As I have said, I intend  to meet Minister Deenihan to discuss this matter in full. It is vital. Members  and the public across the island, particularly people from around Clones and  Fermanagh, have raised concerns with me that this will not be achieved.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McMullan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Will the Minister explain how the  interests of landowners affected by any major construction works will be  protected?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  There has been quite a lot of interest from concerned landowners, particularly  in the South. However, a huge programme of consultation will be completed  before any compulsory purchase order comes through. Work will be done with  landowners well before anyone&rsquo;s property is bought. This process has been  ongoing for some time, and speculation in some of the local newspapers has not  made things any easier. However, unless anyone tells me differently, I am led  to believe that landowners have been consulted on the process and that they are  being worked with on a regular basis.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Swann</strong>: I  acknowledge the Minister&rsquo;s statement. She mentioned property disposals made in  the Republic of Ireland. Can she outline whether any  property disposals are expected in Northern Ireland?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  I have not been informed of any property disposals here, but I am expecting to  be updated on that at the end of the week. I am meeting Mr Deenihan on a  different issue concerning European funding, but I intend to raise the matter  of the Ulster  canal. Some of the questions raised today have not been covered by the  information that I have received from my officials. Those will be raised and  forwarded to Members where appropriate.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McKevitt</strong>:  Can the Minister explain why the Newry canal is not included in the remit of Waterways  Ireland&rsquo;s corporate plan for 2011-13?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  I am sorry; I did not catch that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Can you repeat the question, please?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McKevitt</strong>:  Certainly. Can the Minister explain why the Newry canal is not included in the  remit of Waterways Ireland&rsquo;s corporate plan for 2011-13?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  The issue of the Newry canal has been raised locally. Work has been done on  footbridges and environmental works, but I am not aware that there are any  plans for a full restoration to a working canal. No such plans have been  earmarked to be brought through in this mandate.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: Mrs  McKevitt has stolen my thunder, so I will ask about the Lagan navigation. Are  there any plans to restore that vital piece of infrastructure?</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.00 am</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  I visited the towpath recently and saw the Lock Keeper&rsquo;s Inn,  the environmental work and the footpath, and I am aware of the different  councils&rsquo; involvement in that. Again, it is all down to money. I can appreciate  the importance of full restoration, but it is really all down to budgetary  constraints. Until there is a change in circumstances, I do not anticipate any  further restoration.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Irwin</strong>:  With reference to the product development studies, the Committee was informed  in June that studies have taken place on the Shannon/Erne waterway and the  Erne, Foyle and Dublin city canals, and that  studies in Northern Ireland  are planned for 2011-12. Can the Minister confirm whether any of those studies  have been completed in Northern    Ireland? What assurances can she give that  the studies will be implemented jointly with the relevant agencies and will  involve the private sector?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  I cannot confirm that. I will forward the information to the Member.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr &Oacute; hOis&iacute;n</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire. Given  the folly of the neglect and dereliction that followed partition, particularly  in respect of the Ulster  canal, will you now give us an estimated cost of the restoration of said canal?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  The full restoration cost is &euro;35 million, which was committed by the Irish  Government, with &pound;40,000 per annum from us for the upkeep, based on full  restoration. That is the full cost.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hilditch</strong>:  Thank you for the statement. There were 13 countries involved in the EU  INTERREG IVc project. Can the Minister indicate at this early stage any impact  that the current economic situation has had on visitor numbers to the inland  waterways and lakelands?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  As I said earlier, we are meeting some of the 17 partners from some of the 13 countries  this week in relation to the INTERREG programme. It is estimated that possibly  around 70,000 to 80,000 people have attended different events as part of the  waterways programme. In relation to the EU-funded programme, this week we hope  to consolidate lessons learned, knowledge gained and what we would do  differently. It is really good to listen to the experience of other countries &mdash;  Holland has  taken the lead on it &mdash; to learn how we can improve our waterways as an  attractive option for tourism.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  I thank the Minister for the statement. We are aware that a large number of  people work for Waterways Ireland in Northern Ireland. Does the Minister  have any information on any anticipated or possible job losses in Northern Ireland  as a result of the financial constraints that all Departments are facing?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  I have no information on anticipated job losses, despite the fact that there  are financial constraints. Both bodies have already encouraged efficiencies,  although there is a myth that they do not. I have no information that there  will be any job losses, but I will check with my officials and, if there is any  such information, I will let you know.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Sheehan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Will the Minister tell us what Waterways  Ireland is doing to raise the profile of inland waterways as a key tourism  product?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  The marketing and promotion strategy includes not only Waterways Ireland but a  market advisory group, which comprises the Northern Ireland Tourist Board,  F&aacute;ilte Ireland  and representatives from local government. Arising from a review in 2004, the  marketing strategy was formulated for 2011-16 to take on experience gained  since the last review, to talk to partners from other countries who are  involved in tourism around waterways and to build on the success that they have  achieved.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il  leis an Aire as an r&aacute;iteas a rinne s&iacute; ar Uiscebheala&iacute; &Eacute;ireann. T&aacute; ceist bheag  agam di. Will the Minister undertake to amend the legislation that governs  Waterways Ireland to include the Newry canal in its remit?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  I cannot give the Member a commitment to do that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>:  On a positive note, I congratulate Waterways Ireland on the excellent work that  it has done to promote the lower Bann. Given the shortage of cash in the  coffers of the two Governments, what discussions have there been about  attracting investment from the private sector? Does the Minister agree that the  potential for job creation in the lower Bann, for example, is immense if only  we had the encouragement of and investment from the private sector to put money  into much safer places than it did in the past, when it put money into property  development?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  I am not going to comment on property development, but I see the merit in  trying to attract private investment. Private sector development on Lough Erne  is already quite healthy, as evidenced by the boats and water tourism there.  Securing additional EU money or private money for promoting tourism,  particularly for waterways, is something that I aim to make a priority. I see  the value of it, particularly for the communities that live and work around the  waterways, more often than not in rural areas. It would be a real boost to the  rural economy if waterways were further developed.</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="3"></a>Access to Justice Review</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford (The  Minister of Justice)</strong>: With your permission, Mr Speaker, I wish to make a  statement on the Access to Justice review. Members will have heard me speak  previously, in this Chamber and elsewhere, of the opportunities that the  devolution of justice provided us with, including the opportunity to reshape  our justice system to fit the needs of Northern Ireland. Members will also  recall that, with that in mind, in September 2010 I commissioned a fundamental  review to develop our thinking on how best to ensure access to justice in our  society. Today, I am pleased to publish the report of the review and to begin a  period of public consultation on its findings and recommendations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Fair and effective access to justice is an essential  element of getting justice right; it is critical to building confidence and is  an important part of our vision for a future justice system. Our present system  is built on providing financial assistance to those who could not otherwise  find the money to pay for legal representation. However, I wanted a review that  would examine other approaches and better ways of using the funds available. I  thank Jim Daniell and his team for their very detailed work over many months to  produce the report. I also thank those who offered comments or who otherwise  contributed to it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The report is a comprehensive analysis, containing 159  conclusions and recommendations. I encourage Members to read it carefully.  Since I became Minister of Justice, legal aid has been one of the areas  prompting members of the public to write to me. I know that many Members have  also received correspondence about situations where the system appears not to  work well. In my replies I have said that I expect the report to provide ideas  for solving some of those problems, and I believe that it does. Public  consultation on the report will last three months. Many people and  organisations made representations to the review team as its work progressed,  and I thank all those who offered ideas or who shared their experience of the  system. It is important that all who wish to comment be given the opportunity  to tell us what they think needs to be changed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Having considered those comments, I will make a formal  response in the new year. However, I reassure Members that the period of public  consultation will not hold up the delivery of changes that we are already  making and which have been endorsed by the report. In the Justice Act (Northern Ireland)  2011 the Assembly legislated for new powers that will allow the recovery of  legal aid costs from convicted defendants who can pay. That development has  been endorsed by the report, and I will shortly be publishing proposals for  commencing those powers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The report suggests that responsibility for financial  assessment for such a means test should fall to the Legal Services Commission  (LSC). It also proposes that the Legal Services Commission should take on the  responsibility for decisions to certify for the use of counsel in Magistrate&rsquo;s  Courts. That responsibility currently rests with the judiciary, and I will want  to consider carefully the views of the Lord Chief Justice and the Attorney  General about the proposed change.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are other areas where the findings of the report  coincide with work already under way. The report highlights the importance of  continuing to scrutinise legal aid expenditure, noting that, over the past  financial year, spending on legal aid in Magistrate&rsquo;s Courts rose by around  38%. That was partly because of an increase in the volume of cases, but higher  average costs also appear to have played a large part. A review of legal aid  fees paid for cases in the Magistrate&rsquo;s Courts began last month, and that  exercise will consider the issues identified in the report.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Running alongside the review of Magistrate&rsquo;s Courts fees  will be a review of the fees paid for legal advice given to those under arrest  and held in police stations. That is particularly important for people being investigated  for criminal offences, and it has been endorsed as a requirement by European  human rights case law. Good early advice is essential to ensure that a  defendant&rsquo;s rights are protected. The report recommends improvements to current  arrangements, particularly the establishment of a more formal duty solicitor  scheme across Northern    Ireland. There are useful models for that in  other jurisdictions, and, picking up on those recommendations, the review that  has just begun will look at how our system could be improved.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The report notes the public concern that has been expressed  about what appear to be disproportionate costs to the legal aid fund and to the  justice system as a whole when defendants elect for trial by jury at the Crown  Court in cases of alleged dishonesty involving goods or cash of relatively low  value. In the past year, there were a small number of high profile cases.  Although the report concludes that the right to elect for trial by jury should  remain, it makes helpful proposals on how costs could be contained.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The report considers diversionary measures and alternatives  to prosecution for less serious first- and second-time offenders, including  fixed penalty notices, prosecutorial fines and conditional cautions. In recent  years, some progress has been made in Northern Ireland, especially in the  field of restorative justice, but the report suggests that a more ambitious  approach could yield positive results. It suggests that Northern Ireland,  with a centralised prosecution service and the PSNI covering the whole of the  jurisdiction, is particularly well suited to such an approach. The report  commends, in particular, the approach taken in Scotland, and we will want to look  carefully at that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The report looks at the possibility of introducing one standard  fee to apply whether there is a guilty plea or the case goes to trial &mdash; as is  the case in Scotland  &mdash; as a measure to avoid unnecessarily prolonging some cases. It suggests that  further research is needed, and I have asked officials to take the matter  forward as part of the work already under way through the Speeding up Justice  programme.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members will know that, in recent months, in response to  the withdrawal by many solicitors from Crown Court cases, I had to consider the  emergency introduction of a public defender service to ensure that  unrepresented defendants would have access to the legal advice and assistance  to which they are entitled under the European Convention on Human Rights and  the Human Rights Act 1998. I am pleased to confirm that such withdrawal action  has now ended and that the contingency plans that were being developed have not  been necessary.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The report notes, however, that public defender  arrangements are in place in Scotland  and in England and Wales. Although  the report emphasises the benefits of the independent private sector legal  professions, particularly their clear independence from the state, it states  that it is right to undertake contingency planning to fill gaps in supply.  Emergency measures are not required immediately, but, in response to the  report, I would welcome comments on whether such a service should be introduced  here.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The report rightly records that the interests of victims  and witnesses are central to the justice system, and it notes the work that has  been done and continues to be developed by the Department of Justice, the  Criminal Justice Board and a range of public and voluntary sector agencies.  That work remains a high priority for my Department, and, in the coming months,  it is something on which we will work closely with the Justice Committee.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In looking at civil legal aid, the report considers how to  give priority to the most vulnerable in society and how to encourage early  dispute resolution. It finds that cases concerning family and children account  for 70% of the current spend of civil legal aid, which is clearly a problem  that needs to be addressed. Unlike the current proposal in England and Wales, which would remove private  family law cases from the scope of civil legal aid, the review team recommends  that legal aid should continue to be available for those who are financially  eligible in such cases, but that the system should discourage the use of the  court to prolong or reopen disputes. The report notes that many cases do not  necessarily need to be resolved in a court hearing, and it recommends the use  of mediation, collaborative interventions or other alternatives to court  proceedings. It makes a number of detailed proposals on legal aid costs in  family cases. For example, as legal aid for undefended divorce cases that are  heard in chambers requires a minimum of legal work, it does not warrant the  presence of counsel. The report proposes that legal aid funding in such cases  should be limited to an appropriate standard fee.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The report also identifies public law children&rsquo;s cases as  an area in which costs could be reduced without risking harm to the quality of  the outcome. The number of parties that receive publicly funded representation,  the level of representation, the type of legal representation that is  appropriate to the court tier and the use of expert witnesses are identified as  other areas in which savings might be made. In that area, the report&rsquo;s findings  go much wider than legal aid, and it recommends that there be a fundamental  review of family justice in Northern Ireland. That is a key issue, and I would  very much welcome views on the proposal.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the finding that many cases do not necessarily  need to be resolved in a court hearing and the recommendation for the use of  mediation and other alternatives. My views on that underpinned my decision to  commission the review. Some of those are already being used in Northern  Ireland, but the report recommends that they be developed further. For example,  neighbour disputes and antisocial behaviour may be suitable for community-based  alternative dispute resolution rather than applications before the court for  injunctions or prosecutions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One significant area that was examined was money damages  cases. The report recommends that conditional fee arrangements &mdash; that is, no  win no fee &mdash; should be introduced in Northern Ireland, with safeguards to  prevent an escalation in costs with, perhaps, an insurance-based solution that  enables plaintiffs to insure against the legal cost of losing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The cost of civil legal aid, the importance of ensuring  that limited resources are properly targeted and the need to ensure value for  money are also recurring themes. We have already made significant changes that  will reduce the cost of criminal legal aid, and the report recommends  significant changes to legal aid fees in civil cases. It proposes the  introduction of a standard fee structure and harmonisation of the rules for  financial eligibility, and it suggests that consideration be given to increasing  the contributions from those who can afford it and the inclusion of housing  equity in the calculation of capital limits. On value for money, it recommends  the establishment of a statutory registration scheme for providers of legally  aided services, together with proportionate and cost-effective systems for  monitoring quality.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The report recognises that contracting and best-value  tendering could play a part in enabling market pressures to secure efficiencies  in service provision. That issue is also addressed in the recent Criminal  Justice Inspection report on the use of legal services by the criminal justice  system, which was published before the summer. The report also considers the  establishment of alternative business models that enable solicitors, barristers  and other professionals to work together in one organisation, as already  happens in England and Wales. We will want to look carefully at the experience  from other jurisdictions in considering that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Section 8, which is entitled &lsquo;Living within Budget and the  Options for Further Savings&rsquo;, sets out some detailed proposals for savings. I  will consider them very carefully. The report has also made proposals for how  we manage access to justice, recommending that all legal aid policy, which is  currently split between the Courts and Tribunals Service and the Legal Services  Commission, should be brought together in the Department of Justice as part of  the new access to justice directorate. However, it states &mdash; I completely agree  with this principle &mdash; that individual decisions on the granting of legal aid  should be taken independently of government or political influence. It  concludes that the body that is charged with such decisions should remain at  arm&rsquo;s length from the Department. Again, I completely agree with that  principle. Whatever changes we make to structures will be to improve  efficiency, reduce unnecessary costs and allow us to bring forward necessary  reforms as quickly as possible.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The report is very comprehensive, and, once again, I thank  Jim Daniell and the small review team for the amount of work that they  completed in just 12 months. It is impossible to do justice to it in a brief  statement today, but it provides a broad and far-reaching agenda of work for us  to take forward in the months and years ahead. Given its importance, I  encourage Members and the wider public to read it and comment as part of the  consultation.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney  (The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for Justice)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat,  a Cheann Comhairle. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as an r&aacute;iteas seo ar maidin.  In the absence of the Chairperson, Paul Givan, I speak on behalf of the  Committee. Mr Speaker, you have provided with me some latitude to ask my  question, so thank you very much. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  N&iacute;or chuala m&eacute; sin. I thank the Minister for his statement, and, of behalf of  the Committee, I welcome the publication of the final report, &lsquo;Access to  Justice Review&rsquo;. The Committee looks forward to discussing the findings and  conclusions of what is, as the Minister said, a very detailed report. We look  forward to seeing Jim Daniell and his team and, no doubt, the Minister, before  the Committee. Given the breadth and scope of the report, does the Minister  intend to prioritise the various areas and recommendations that it covers when  considering the implementation programme? Will he seek views on what the  priority areas should be? What will be the timeline for that consultation? It  is important that the Minister say whether there are any recommendations that  he feels that the Department can take forward in the absence of the  consultation process being completed. That concludes my remarks on behalf of  the Committee.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On behalf of my party, I welcome the report. We look  forward to the Minister and to Jim Daniell&rsquo;s review team coming before the  Committee. Can the Minister assure the Assembly that the guiding principles  will be fair and equitable access to justice?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  thank Mr McCartney in his role as Deputy Chairperson of the Committee &mdash; I think  that it is the first time that he has had the opportunity to speak first in  that role &mdash; and as a member of his party. I welcome the fact that, in both  capacities, he has seen virtues in the report. I have no doubt that, in both of  those capacities, he will engage thoroughly with Jim Daniell and, no doubt,  with my officials and me.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">He asked about the prioritisation of recommendations. In my  statement I made it clear that some aspects were already covered in the 2011  Act, on which we will be able to carry forward work at an early stage. In other  respects, when I say that the report is now out for consultation for 12 weeks,  it is because, naively, I put it out for consultation genuinely seeking the  views of the public and of the Assembly, particularly the Justice Committee.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Given that there are so many recommendations and that it is  such a complex report, there will need to be a significant degree of  prioritisation. I will certainly welcome the views that come into that, because  I am determined that we should make as much progress as fast as possible on the  spirit of partnership that the Department and the Committee have adopted so  far. On that basis, we will be taking those forward, and the key principle of  fair and equal access to justice for all, which the Member highlighted when  speaking for his party, is a key principle for us.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We looked at affordability, and the report has considered  that. It has also been doing that in a way that ensures that we get access to  justice; however, that may not necessarily be the adversarial court system that  we have been used to. Nonetheless, we will seek to ensure access to justice.  For example, that is why we specifically recommend that some issues remain in  the scope of assistance in Northern Ireland that have been removed from scope  in England and Wales.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Anderson</strong>:  I, too, thank the Minister for his statement, and I place on record my thanks  to Jim Daniell and his team for a detailed and extensive report. The Minister  referred to the report&rsquo;s recommendations on diversionary measures on the  community-based alternative dispute resolution. Although I understand the need  to avoid expensive court cases where possible, some people might have concerns  about softer options. What are the Minister&rsquo;s views?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  thank Mr Anderson for his welcome of the report. When looking at alternative  dispute resolution, particularly around the civil area, we are not necessarily  looking at something that might be categorised as either a hard or a soft  option. We are looking at something that seeks conciliation and a better result  for all parties involved than we frequently see from an adversarial court  system. Take the different methods of working adopted by the Youth Justice  Agency: I certainly do not accept the premise that some options around youth  conferencing are in any way easy compared with some of the more traditional  systems. Indeed, the concept of a young person having to take restorative  action, perhaps by meeting and apologising to the victim and doing community  service, may be significantly harder for them than seeing a parent pay a fine  for them.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement and, indeed, commend the authors for the  detailed and comprehensive report that is before us. There is much to think  about and discuss. Given the complexities of the issues in the report and the  necessity to engage not just with the Committee and the Assembly but with  members of the public beyond the 12-week consultation process, will the  Minister outline to us how he envisages we will deal with this in meaningful,  bite-sized pieces?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  thank Mr McCrea for his positive words. I outlined that to some extent in  response to the Committee Deputy Chair. First, there is a consultation process,  and that will enable individuals and, in particular, the Committee, of which Mr  McCrea is a member, to highlight priorities for action. The Department will, to  some extent, have to reflect the importance of addressing particular issues.  Some issues will be easier to address, and some will require primary  legislation, which will take a bit longer. However, we will ensure that we take  the widest possible view. Then, as each individual aspect of the review is  implemented, there will be further opportunities for consultation and for  public comment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">So, I do not see the 12-week process as the be-all and  end-all. It will be the start as we seek to see how we will implement the  review, and it will not be done in this Assembly session. It will take a  considerable amount of time to carry through all the recommendations, but I  believe that we have an extremely valuable opportunity to provide a justice  system that works better for all our community. However, I will certainly be  keen to hear everyone&rsquo;s word on the best ways to do that and on which points to  implement first.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I declare an interest as a member of the Bar. The report is comprehensive, and  it would be wrong to be premature in making any assessment of it. Is the  Minister prepared to protect access to justice, make it into a paramount  principle and not sacrifice the quality of justice and legal services simply  because of cost?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Might I ask one further question, Mr Speaker, about a  specific aspect of the report? The report says that the Legal Services  Commission should take on responsibility for decisions to certify for the use  of counsel in the Magistrate&rsquo;s Court. That responsibility currently rests with  the judiciary. Is there not an implication in that for the independence of the  judiciary? If one is to remove that function from the Magistrate&rsquo;s Court and  from district judges, will that not affect the independence of the judiciary?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  am grateful to Mr Maginness for his work, and I notice that he at least, unlike  some others, admits that he is asking more than one question. The specific point  about the LSC certifying for counsel is an issue that will require considerable  consultation with, among others, the judiciary. I am not sure that I share his  concerns about the independence of the judiciary if that power is transferred  from the judiciary to the LSC. However, I suspect that there will be a variety  of views on that issue, not least from his professional colleagues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">His other question was about protecting access to justice.  I referred to those relatively minor cases where people have elected for trial  by jury, and the report recommends that that be preserved despite the public  concern that has been expressed. The idea that we seek measures to ensure that  there is no abuse to finances while preserving the opportunity for a full trial  before a jury is an indication that the report is about preserving access to  justice, and I am determined to ensure that we maintain that. We will not go  down some of the routes that England and Wales have adopted, which have been  thoroughly negative in that respect.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dickson</strong>:  I thank the Minister for coming to us this morning, and congratulations to Mr  Daniell on the report prepared for us. I also congratulate the Minister on the  innovative steps that he has already taken on access to justice, particularly  in settling legal aid matters, over the summer. The alternative dispute  resolution proposals are highly innovative and welcome, but will the Minister  pilot some of those, as appropriate, so that people can see them working and to  prove to the sceptics that ADR is a real and viable alternative in the areas  that he outlined?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>:  That is clearly five in a row, but at least we have a welcome for the report,  and I should be grateful for that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The piloting of ADR mechanisms is the sort of issue about  which I hope that the Committee will give me its views. There are significant  opportunities for piloting alternative methods. For example, the current  president of the Law Society sees particular benefits in mediation as part of  his field of professional expertise. From my background as a social worker, I  see significant need to move away from the direction in which family law cases  have gone in recent years, which is to become excessively adversarial rather  than have the opportunity to promote mediation. Whether we can run pilots in  geographical patches or simply look at discrete areas of work and see how we  apply them is the sort of issue that we need to follow through on in the  consultation, but it is one on which I will be keen to hear views.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clearly, there is an issue around family cases and some  around minor monetary cases, where these things can perhaps be piloted in one  area of work. It would be worth looking at that to see that we get the best  possible opportunities for people to resolve such difficulties in a way that is  more satisfying to both parties.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I also thank the Minister for his  statement. There is a lack of legal advice and legal representation in cases  involving children and young people in issues outside family law. Children&rsquo;s  risks go beyond public law and family law justice. Legal representation is  absent at education or mental health tribunals that children and young people  go to. How will the Minister address that deficit?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  thank the Member for her welcome. I am not an expert on the operation of  education tribunals. I understood that legal representation was available in  mental health tribunals, but I will check that point and get back to her.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Overend</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. The review states that the right to  elect for trial by jury &ldquo;should remain as now&rdquo;. However, it suggests:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;ways of keeping the incidence and costs of these  cases within bounds.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Does the Minister agree that this is a fundamental  tenet of democracy and that he should be careful about tampering with it?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  agree with the Member that the concept of trial by jury has been recognised by  the report as a fundamental tenet, and if that is a tenet of our justice  system, I have no intention of interfering with it. I will be interested to see  whether others have comments to make during the next three months.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Eastwood</strong>:  I, too, welcome the report. Does the Minister agree that the welfare of  children is paramount in our society &mdash; I am sure that he does &mdash; and that the  burden of costs should not be prohibitive and a consideration in ensuring that  children get access to justice?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  agree entirely that the welfare of children is a very serious issue that at  times has to be addressed by the justice system. However, when we look at  alternative methods of dealing with family and children&rsquo;s cases, the issue for  me is one not just of cost but of what is the most satisfactory resolution to  sometimes extremely difficult family problems.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">From my professional background, I see little evidence that  an adversarial court system is necessarily the best way in which to promote the  long-term interests of a child who, for example, may have to get on with both  parents in the future. That is why I believe that there are significant  benefits from some of the ADR proposals in the report as an alternative to  adversarial court systems. However, there will be occasions when it will  clearly be necessary for people to resort to courts. Indeed, I know that, in  certain circumstances at the moment, judges require people to seek a degree of  mediation about things such as arrangements for children&rsquo;s welfare in divorce  cases. It is a matter of ensuring that we find the best way of meeting the  needs of children, rather than seeking any particular legal form of that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lyttle</strong>: I  welcome the commissioning of the report by the Minister and the substantive and  comprehensive report that has been brought forward by its authors. Given that  the report appears to consider a fixed means test for eligibility for civil  legal aid, is there a concern that that might reduce, rather than increase,  fair access to justice?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  thank the Member for his question. There is a danger that if we apply a fixed  means test that is too low there could be the issue of reducing access. If you  look at the work that the Department has done over the past year in dealing  with the means test issue for non-molestation orders, you will see that is not  the way that we have been seeking to operate. We will seek to ensure that any  means test is applied at a suitable level. However, it is also the case that,  at times, people who could afford to fund their legal cases benefit from legal  aid arrangements. We need to strike the right balance while ensuring that we  get access to justice for the most needy in our society.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Copeland</strong>:  I also join in the congratulations that have been flowing towards the Minister.  I particularly welcome the aspects of the report that deal with family law. As  many of us know, it is an area that is sodden with tears and, on occasions, poisoned  with venom. Will the Minister, in so far as he can, undertake to establish and  identify those cases in which law is used as an impediment to justice and  where, in the event of a breakdown, one partner who has access to legal aid  vigorously pursues the other partner who does not, almost to the point of  bankruptcy? That matter has important relevance to these proceedings.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  thank the Member. I think that he is possibly the first one to congratulate the  Minister, as opposed to Jim Daniell and the team, so I will take that as a  compliment; thank you very much.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, he raises a serious point and one that I know he  and other Members will have heard about, as I have, which is the issue of  family disputes where one partner is entitled to legal aid and the other is not  &mdash; perhaps somebody with fairly modest means, but who falls just outside the  scope of legal aid &mdash; and the difficulties that arise with multiple court  applications. Those issues need to be addressed as an abuse of process, and  they do nothing for the welfare of an ex-partner or children. We need to cover  those issues to ensure that we get the best possible resolution and that we  deal with those multiple applications. There are references to it in the  report, and I have no doubt that Mr Copeland and others will comment on it  during the consultation period.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>:  In these times of austerity, it is right and proper that we should discuss how  we save money. I am sure that the Minister will agree that the court system  still has all the trappings of bygone days when money was plentiful and men  wore gowns and wigs. What plans does he have to dispense with those kinds of  practices and bring the court system into the real world where the ordinary  working-class people, who frequent it largely, can identify with it?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>:  Even by the standards of creativity that apply in the Chamber, that was a  fairly good one. To the best of my knowledge, no part of the legal aid budget  funds the purchase of gowns or wigs, save in so far as the recipients of fees  through the legal aid system may choose to buy their own. Perhaps Mr Maginness,  who is chortling to the side, could advise his colleague on his personal  practice in such respects.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, if Mr Dallat is making a valid point about the  issue of access to justice and the courts being seen to be accessible and  places where normal people do not feel intimidated by an atmosphere of wigs and  gowns, then I agree with him. I welcome the fact that there have been moves in  that direction in recent years. However, it lies with the judiciary and the  professional practices of solicitors and barristers to work through at various  levels as to how they choose to present themselves in court, rather than being  anything that the Minister should interfere in any more than I have done  already.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  I declare an interest, of course, as a member of the Northern Ireland Bar. I  regret that Mr Dallat would deny the follicularly challenged of us the option  of having some head covering, but there it is.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are so many things in the report, some of which one  can empathise and agree with and others about which one would have very severe  reservations. The report is entitled &lsquo;Access to Justice Review Northern  Ireland&rsquo;, but my concern is that some proposals within it will, in fact,  deliver the very opposite and diminish access to justice. On the specifics of  civil legal aid, for example, the proposition that the equity that someone  holds in their house should become a capital consideration &mdash; [Interruption.]</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I encourage the Member to come to his question.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  I am sure that you heard the exhortations to that effect. That the capital &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. I insist that the Member come to his question. The Member will know that  I have given a number of Members quite a bit of latitude this morning. Standing  Orders are clear that there should be one question to a ministerial statement.  However, because of the nature of this morning&rsquo;s statement, I have been  prepared to give Members some latitude in coming to their question.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  Of course, you have allowed one Member two questions, and you have not yet  allowed me one, yet it might be thought that I might know something about this  subject.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to civil legal aid, an imposition is placed on  people who might be asset rich, in the sense that they have a house, but cash  poor. How can taking into account the fact of house ownership and the value of  that house ever help access to justice? Will that not, as one specific,  diminish access to justice? Will going down the road of the American system of  no win, no fee not increase damages, as lawyers walk away with 30% and 40% of  the damages awarded, rather than save money?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>:  Despite the remarks about those follicularly challenged people entitled to wear  wigs in court and the fact that I, as one appearing in the witness box, has  never been able to do so, Mr Allister raises a significant point about the no  win, no fee proposals, which the report recognises. There are significant  issues within which checks and balances would be required, but no doubt he and  others will wish to comment on that specific proposal as one way of looking  forward. Similarly, specific issues, such as the sorts of amounts of capital  that are taken into account and whether they include such things as equity in  housing, will require detailed consideration. I do not think that it is  something that we will resolve here this morning. It is an issue that needs to  be followed through, because Mr Allister makes what some people will see as a  valid point and others will see as a plea on behalf of those who have capital.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. The Minister mentioned alternative  dispute resolution. In his statement, he referred specifically to  community-based alternative dispute resolution and its use in family  circumstances. Not all civil disputes outside of family disputes lend  themselves to community-based solutions. What action will the Minister take to  encourage the development of alternative dispute resolutions in other areas of  civil law?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  thank Mr Weir for that point. It is clear that a variety of issues come under  the general term of alternative dispute resolution, some of which are  community-based, as he highlighted, and others that, I suspect, may well  provide openings for those with legal qualifications. Some of those who are  involved in arbitration, for example, have specific legal backgrounds that  would be of benefit in that regard. We are looking at a range of issues. Family  matters are dear to my heart because of my background. I also think that a  number of minor business disputes, for example, might fit into some form of  slightly more formal but still alternative process. One of the key issues is to  ensure that we find alternative methods that do not necessarily shut off the  option of going to court, if necessary, as a last resort. They should, however,  incentivise the reaching of an agreement, rather than incentivising the maximum  level of disagreement, as sometimes happens in an adversarial system.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  Could the Minister survive on &pound;680,000 a year? A barrister who appeared before  the Justice Committee complained that he would have to survive on that as a  result of the Minister&rsquo;s savage cuts. My heart bleeds for him. There is a lot  of concern about the fact that legal aid expenditure has increased by 38% in a  single financial year, as the Daniell report indicates. Surely we need to put a  cap on the amount that any individual senior counsel can earn. Let us put it at,  say, &pound;300,000 &mdash; they could survive on that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, is it not time for the Minister to state what  each senior counsel is given and how much money they have got from legal aid  over the past five years?</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  am not sure how many questions were in that one, Mr Speaker.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I should make it clear to Mr Wells that the specific  reference to a 38% increase in costs was specifically in relation to legal aid  in the Magistrate&rsquo;s Courts in the past financial year. As a member of the  Committee, Mr Wells will know that he has played his part in reducing Crown  Court costs in the past while.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am not sure whether there are any means by which the  Department of Justice could cap the total amount paid to barristers in any one  year, even if it should do so. I suspect that the issue has to be to ensure  that there is value for money in the time spent by lawyers who are paid from  the public purse for the work that they seek to do.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I shall ignore his first question about what salary I could  live on, but I think the Member knows that Ministers are paid somewhat less  than the figure he quoted.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are serious issues here. We need to recognise that  for many solicitors and barristers, particularly solicitors, in current  circumstances and in areas of work such as conveyancing, there are relatively  low earnings compared to a few years ago. Not all barristers and solicitors are  earning &pound;600,000 a year, or whatever it is. The only issue that I am concerned  about is that those paid from the public purse provide value for money and that  we find the best way of getting justice for the citizen rather than the best  way of putting money into the pockets of lawyers, expert witnesses or anybody  else. The issue has to be access to justice for the citizens of Northern  Ireland.</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="4"></a>On-street Parking Charges</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy (The  Minister for Regional Development)</strong>: Mr Speaker, with your permission, I  wish to make a statement on the outcome of my review of my Department&rsquo;s  proposal to introduce on-street parking charges to towns and cities across  Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Members will be aware, the proposal to roll out  on-street charging to approximately 30 towns and cities across Northern Ireland  was included in my Department&rsquo;s budget 2011-15 as part of the revenue-raising  proposal by the previous Minister. The issue generated widespread debate in all  parties in the lead-up to the Assembly election in May, and my party had a  manifesto commitment to review the proposal. On taking up office as Minister  for Regional Development, I identified this as a major issue in my Department  and immediately instigated an urgent review of the proposal.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As part of my review, I have consulted widely with local  public representatives, town centre traders, local chambers of commerce and the  Northern Ireland Independent Retail Trade Association (NIIRTA). I want to pay  particular tribute to the association and its chief executive, Mr Glyn Roberts,  for providing a major contribution to the review.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I visited Comber, Cookstown, Dungannon, Enniskillen,  Magherafelt and Portadown, to name but a few, to hear what local people had to  say on the matter. I also received representations from traders in  Carrickfergus, Kilkeel, Downpatrick, Newtownards, Bangor, Larne and Armagh. The  overwhelming view across Northern Ireland was that the proposal would have a  detrimental impact on towns and, more importantly, the local economy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Having listened to viewpoints across Northern Ireland, and  after careful consideration, I have decided that I will not introduce new  on-street car parking charges in the proposed 30 towns and cities. I have heard  a united voice in opposition to the proposals and believe that not introducing  the charges is the right decision in the current economic climate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise that on-street charging can provide vital  traffic management improvements in certain circumstances. Indeed, on-street  charging has been operating in Belfast since 1987 and in Lisburn and Newry  since 2008. I am, of course, familiar with the scheme in Newry, which has brought  significant improvement to traffic flows and access to retail and tourist  attractions in the city. I am always open to requests to introduce on-street  charging from traders and local councils in any town or city where they  anticipate traffic management or commercial benefits. A lot of work has taken  place in Londonderry, and that might be a location where traders want to  discuss further the introduction of on-street charging and the benefits that it  can bring to city centre business.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I highlighted earlier, this proposal is included in my  Department&rsquo;s budget. I therefore have to find approximately &pound;8&middot;8 million from  other areas over the Budget period to make up the projected revenue lost from  on-street parking. Given the pressures in all areas of my budget, it is a  difficult task. However, I am determined to minimise, as far as possible, the  impact on front line services in my Department. I therefore propose to offset  the &pound;8&middot;8 million shortfall with the following savings: &pound;2 million from greater  efficiency in my Department; a &pound;2 million reduction in Roads Service&rsquo;s  operational expenditure; &pound;2&middot;1 million income from off-street parking charges in  provincial towns and on-street charges in some cities, which is a change and a  correction to the statement that Members have before them, and I apologise for  that, but for the sums to add up I needed to make that amendment and I stand  humbly before the House; and a &pound;2&middot;7 million reduction in the subsidy paid to  Translink, which I do not expect to lead directly to any increase in fares.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let me explain each of those areas in more detail. It is  important when we make changes to give a full explanation; I am not a Minister  who makes an announcement and then people cannot understand how it is paid for.  My 2011-15 budget also includes proposals to carry out a series of reviews of  off-street car park charges and existing on-street parking charges. In the  majority of cases, those tariffs have remained unchanged for 12 years and have  fallen well behind rates charged in private car parks. Let me reassure Members  that there is no profit in car-parking charges. The money received from parking  charges and penalty charges on drivers who park illegally goes towards the  costs of providing parking services, which include: the cost of traffic  attendants; the management and maintenance of all car parks; the collection and  banking of cash; the provision of lines and signs; departmental staff costs;  and capital depreciation of car parks. In 2010-11, it cost &pound;22 million to run  those services, whereas income from parking charges and penalties was in the  region of &pound;15 million. That means that it costs my Department approximately &pound;7  million a year to operate parking services. Going forward, I want to work  towards my Department&rsquo;s parking services becoming self-funding.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some months ago, Translink was notified by my Department of  the levels of revenue support that it can expect over the Budget period. As a  result, it has been able to bring forward developed financial plans for the  next few years which balance the need for it to operate profitably with the  need to maintain an overall public transport network. For this year, Translink  has, to date, been able to operate without increasing fares, but such an  approach requires it to operate as cost-effectively as possible and it is  necessary to sometimes review the frequency and use of services in those  circumstances. In the present economic climate, avoiding fare increases for as  long as possible is important and contrasts with the situation in other parts  of the British Isles. Part of the thinking is that an approach that minimises  fare increases stands the best chance of growing the numbers of fare-paying  passengers who use public transport. Combined with measures to prioritise  public transport, such as the Belfast on the Move initiative, I hope that  Translink can generate more funding for itself, rather than overly rely on  public subsidy or reimbursement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Currently, Translink receives some &pound;70 million in funding  from my Department. That covers direct subsidy to the railways, reimbursement  of concessionary fares and fuel duty rebate for bus services. That level of  support is expected to be maintained next year before it drops materially in  2013-14 and 2014-15. Nevertheless, I believe that it is necessary to reduce the  level of Translink subsidy by a further &pound;1&middot;3 million in 2013-14 and &pound;1&middot;4  million in 2014-15 because I expect that it can grow numbers of fare-paying  passengers and resulting income in the interim.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I emphasise that I hope to protect the levels of subsidy  being provided to rail users, given the plan to introduce new trains on to the  network. I do not intend that that additional saving will impact on fare  levels, and I will look closely at that area as I agree Translink&rsquo;s financial  plan. I appreciate that some people may not be happy with a slight decrease in  funding for public transport. However, given the tight budget that I inherited  and the potential for Translink to generate additional income, I believe that  the change can be managed internally without impacting front line services.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Turning now to the efficiencies in the Department, the  spending and savings proposals in its 2010 budget set out spending plans on the  basis of a flat admin budget across the four years of the Budget period. The  Department has initiated plans to live within that allocation by absorbing pay  increases and other pressures within its admin budget. That involves using  natural wastage efficiencies created by people leaving the organisation due to  age retirement and other reasons. It also involves an ongoing programme of  organisational reviews that will look at efficiencies in the use of staff and  general administrative expenditure.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My revised plan identifies a further &pound;1 million in  efficiencies from the Department for Regional Development (DRD) staffing budget  in years three and four of the Budget period, which are 2013-14 and 2014-15.  Those new pressures will also be addressed through organisational efficiencies  and natural wastage opportunities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My Department will use established procedures for dealing  with any staff surpluses that arise, including redeployment to other duties  within either DRD or other Departments. I wish to make it clear that there are  no plans for staff redundancies. My Department will consult fully with trade  unions and staff as appropriate in taking forward proposals for the  efficiencies that are required to live within budget.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, Roads Service will make its &pound;2 million reduction  in operational expenditure through savings on repairing low-category carriageway  defects that have not yet become hazardous and that will now have low impact on  the public.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I believe that today&rsquo;s announcement about not rolling out  new on-street parking charges demonstrates how a local Minister listens to the  views of local people and delivers outcomes that reflect their needs. I also  believe that it will help local businesses in what is a challenging time  economically across Northern Ireland, and I am pleased that I have been able to  deliver on a commitment that my party gave during the recent election campaign.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that Members and traders across Northern Ireland  will welcome the decision that I have taken today. I commend the statement to  the House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt (The  Chairperson of the Committee for Regional Development)</strong>: I thank the  Minister for his statement and, indeed, for briefing me and the Deputy  Chairperson yesterday. It is disappointing that we will see a 100% increase in  off-street car parking fees over the next two or three years. Although there is  an argument that Belfast should not be the only place to feel the pain, it is  equally true that Belfast enjoys a greater public transport provision, unlike  towns in rural areas where the inadequate transport structure necessitates  bringing cars into towns. That will therefore adversely impact on rural  dwellers. I also note from the Roads Service website that there are  approximately 76 DRD car parks throughout Northern Ireland, with about 15,600  spaces, where no tariffs are charged at all. Perhaps spreading the load would have  been better.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.00 noon</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister assure the House that the increased  charges, coupled with the reductions in rural bus services, will not be  detrimental to our most vulnerable citizens, such as the elderly, those with a  disability, young people, rural dwellers and, indeed, the unemployed? Will the  Minister also advise whether any thought has been given to the disposal of  excess land assets that are currently held by the Northern Ireland Transport  Holding Company?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am grateful to the Chair of the Committee for Regional Development for his  questions. I am sorry that he did not feel it possible to welcome the  announcement that gives huge relief, I believe, to many traders in a great many  towns in Northern Ireland. However, I understand his points of concern.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">First, let me say that there will be no additional  increases to tariffs in Belfast as a result of today&rsquo;s announcement. Even after  tariffs are increased in line with the existing budget proposal, Belfast  charges for either on-street or off-street parking will still be much lower  than many private sector car parks. On average, all urban and rural areas will  increase by a similar percentage. I understand the Member&rsquo;s points on the  impact that any increase will have, particularly on those who are most  vulnerable, and I know that Translink also has to bear that consideration in  mind. I am in discussion and am reflecting with Translink and the Northern  Ireland Transport Holding Company about the assets currently held by the  holding company and how we could move forward on an issue such as that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement.  Indeed, a lot of traders in my constituency from Newcastle and Kilkeel would also  welcome the statement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister give a commitment to work with local  government and chambers of commerce, particularly in the towns that were  considered for charging, to develop traffic management plans? I am thinking of  Newcastle in particular, where there are seasonal pressures with the high  number of tourists visiting the town. Obviously, parking is a problem at  certain periods of the year.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member should come to his question.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Will the Minister give that commitment?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I genuinely thank the Member for congratulating me on the announcement, which  overturns the earlier decision of his party colleague, the previous Minister. I  really am beginning to feel loved and cherished, but with some way to go from  other people.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am happy to give an assurance that my Department and  Roads Service will work with chambers of commerce and other local authority  people to ensure that traffic management plans are sensible and well designed  for towns and, indeed, cities across Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Nesbitt</strong>:  Yesterday, I heard an Executive Minister announce the need to save &pound;22 million  from his departmental budget with no indication of how he intended to do it.  Today, I hear another Executive Minister announce the need to find &pound;8&middot;8 million  and explain in great detail how he intends to do it. Does the Minister have an  opinion on which one is the better form of government?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am very grateful to the Member for his question. I can claim, with some  modest success, that I have not only brought forward a change but have  explained that change in some detail to the House in an open and transparent  way. I much prefer to leave others to judge how that is reflected upon.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Byrne</strong>:  Again at the risk of love calling the Minister, I very much welcome the  statement. I think that it is a very good statement on the three issues  relating to on-street car parking charges. It is a welcome boost, particularly  for retailers in provincial towns who were concerned about the damage that  on-street car parking charges would cause.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister outlined some efficiencies, which I welcome,  to fund the decision not to bring in the charges. Will he give serious  consideration to a comprehensive review of how car park attendants operate in  Northern Ireland? There is a serious concern that they are damaging business in  many provincial towns. Let us review the actual cost of the traffic warden  system in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am grateful to the Member for welcoming the proposals and changes that we have  made. I know that there is concern in some quarters about the role of the  system operators. However, we all have to realise that their job is an  enormously difficult, challenging and unpopular one, almost akin to being a  Minister or, indeed, a Member of the House. I am prepared to look at ways in  which we can move forward. As outlined in my statement, collecting the money  and managing the car parks and the attendant staffing issues cost my Department  year by year. I hope that, at some stage, we can move to equalise the situation  so that it does not cost the taxpayer ongoing sums of money. Traffic wardens  and attendants do a difficult job and, largely, they do so professionally.  However, I will look at the issue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dickson</strong>:  I welcome the statement, particularly because it appears to be a U-turn from  where the Assembly was previously and because traders from Larne and  Carrickfergus, which are in my constituency, were fearful about the effect that  the charges would have on their trade during these difficult recessionary  times.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I turn directly to the savings that you propose to make,  Minister. I seek an absolute assurance that the reduction in Roads Service  operational expenditure will not affect road safety in Northern Ireland, which  is of vital importance.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am grateful to the Member for welcoming the announcement. Having had  representations from people in many towns and, indeed, from public  representatives and chambers of trade and commerce, I know the strength of  feeling out there and the pressure that many of our small and indigenous  retailers are feeling at this time. It is good that we can lift some of that  burden. This is not a panacea for all their ills, and I am not promoting it as  such. It is, however, an important acceptance of the problems that small  retailers face; in particular, their competition with multinationals that  operate in shopping centres with free parking and other facilities. I think  that it will help to level the playing field to an extent and hope that it is  welcomed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Safety on the roads and in all of the areas for which I  have responsibility remains a key priority. Even in challenging economic times,  safety will always be a key priority.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s decision. I sat on the former Regional Development  Committee, and when the original decision was announced, I opposed it.  Therefore, I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s common sense decision to reverse the  proposal to introduce on-street parking charges. In the statement, the Minister  refers to a new figure of, I think, &pound;2&middot;1 million of income that he intends to  find from off-street parking charges. As the Minister will be aware, in my  constituency, there is currently free parking in Cookstown&rsquo;s town centre. Can  he confirm whether that will continue or whether it forms part of his proposal  to introduce charging in certain car parks?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am grateful to the Member for welcoming the broad thrust of the proposals. We  will have to reflect on certain changes. Essentially, he is asking about new  charges for car parks where it is currently free to park. I can confirm that  the current proposal to increase existing tariffs includes the introduction of charging  to 28 car parks where parking is free. Those charges will be introduced in the  near future. My announcement of new on-street parking charges does not apply to  those off-street car parks. The introduction of further charging in off-street  car parks that are currently free will be considered routinely in my  Department&rsquo;s annual tariff reviews.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I visited Cookstown to hear representations, not only from  elected representatives but from the local business community. I will confirm  for the Member as quickly as possible the up-to-date situation for Cookstown.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lyttle</strong>: I  note the Minister and his party colleague&rsquo;s criticism of other Ministers&rsquo;  financial forecasting while waxing lyrical about the success of their own.  However, I also note that the protection of the subsidy for rail users in the  next year is one that is based on &ldquo;hope&rdquo; and that the reduction to public transport  funding for 2013-14 is based on &ldquo;expectation&rdquo;. I am not sure where those  foundations are set.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister forecasted correctly objection to his cut in  public transport funding. I seek his assurance that that reduction will in no  way delay the introduction and operation of the recently and expensively  purchased modern train fleet?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I pay tribute to the Member for his valiant defence of his party colleague on  the Executive. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The cut will not impede the purchase of new trains at all.  The new trains have been a real success &mdash; no pun intended. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> What has been heartening about the upgrading of rail services throughout  Northern Ireland has been the fact that it has led to greater train usage. That  is a very good thing indeed. It is part of the argument and debate that we had  yesterday on the Londonderry to Coleraine line. We want to bring about a  positive outcome to all those issues.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  Mr Speaker, it may be a first, but I want to welcome the ministerial statement  on the reprieve that has been granted to towns that are faced with the threat  of on-street car parking charges, particularly Ballymena and Ballymoney. With  regard to pain, the Minister referred to the fact that 28 car parks will now  come into the charging regime. Can he, by writing or otherwise, identify any of  those car parks that are located in my constituency, North Antrim?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Can he also explain why DRD car parks seem to run at such a  loss whereas private car parks, where the charging regime is not that different,  are very profitable operations? Does that not suggest inefficiency in the  running of departmental car parks?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am flattered in the extreme that the Member has found it in his heart to  welcome my ministerial statement. The entire House can share in my unrelenting  joy in celebration of the enormity of the statement that the Member has made. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will provide the House and the Library with details of  the 28 car parks that have been mentioned. The Member refers to the difference  between private car parks and those that are operated by my Department.  Realistically, anyone who parks in Belfast city centre to facilitate either  work or shopping sees a significant difference between some of the private car  parks and the DRD ones.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have already said that this whole operation costs my  Department &pound;7 million, and we need to move to a situation where there is no  cost to the Department. How do we do that? Is it simply about increasing  charges &mdash; clearly not &mdash; or is it about getting greater efficiency from staff  and resources?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. I want to press him further on the issue of  the 28 car parks. Despite what his colleague from Strangford said about the  detail, it is unfortunate that he had to inform the House that he will place in  the Library the information that affects 28 car parks that are currently free.  In my constituency, Townhead Street car park in Ballymoney is a vital facility  for trade in the town. Will the Minister undertake to provide not only a list  of the 28 car parks, but the rationale for choosing them?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am happy to respond to the Member directly on the issue that he has raised.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Doherty</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I join my colleague Jim Allister in  welcoming the Minister&rsquo;s statement &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Doherty</strong>:  I also thank the Minister for the briefing that he gave me and the Chairperson  of the Committee yesterday. On the savings that you are going to make, you say  that there will be a &pound;2 million reduction in Roads Service&rsquo;s operational  expenditure. You talk about low category carriageway defects. Will you give  some explanation about the criteria for determining such defects? Is there not  a danger that those repairs will become more costly &mdash; I have a pun here &mdash;  further down the road?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I had not realised that my powers of mediation were so extensive. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> I feel that I am drifting into territory  currently owned by David Latimer. There may well be views on that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Going back to the point raised by Mr Dickson about road  safety and carriageway safety, there are relatively routine minor carriageway  defects that can be improved on a more systematic and ongoing basis instead of  sending people out to do a particular patching job when it is not absolutely  essential. All of these things are carefully assessed on the basis of safety,  and that will continue to be the case.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  too welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement and his decision to abandon the proposals  of the previous Minister and those that were contained in the budget for  on-street car parking charges.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Is the Minister content that the proposals will be  supported by NIIRTA? Will he confirm that both the Larne traders and members of  Carrickfergus Chamber of Commerce are agreed on the dangers of this form of  charging, so that we will not be endangering our town centres, which are  obviously in great competition with out-of-town shopping?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I thank the Member for his encouraging remarks, which were completely  unscripted. I assure him that NIRTA is completely behind and understands the  detail of the announcement that I made today. I hope very much that it will be  able to welcome the proposals and join the growing band of people who have done  so. The towns that he mentioned, Larne and Carrickfergus, through their  Chambers of Commerce, their traders and public representatives, have sent the  consistent and unanimous message that on-street car parking charges are a  burden too much. They are an unfair burden in a highly competitive area and in  the current challenging economic circumstances. My announcement today will find  a broad welcome throughout towns and cities all over Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement; however, I recognise that some devil in  the detail has yet to be declared about car parks. Minister, will you assure  the House that there will be no further diminution of the timetabling and  scheduling of Ulsterbus and the other services that are operated by Translink?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I thank the Member for her positive comments. In the operational decisions that  are taken by Translink, every effort is made to take account of local  circumstances and other issues such as value for money, and it will continue to  consider those issues. I have an obvious interest in that area and I will also  want to be assured that it is doing so.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I am more concerned with what the Minister has not said today. What he did say  seems all right, and it was well scripted by the civil servants who know how to  draft these things. I am also concerned that, in one of his replies, he said  that he would place the information that was requested in the Assembly Library.  We are all looking forward to seeing that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">How does the Minister draw a comparison between two towns of  a similar size such as Dungannon and Cookstown? People must pay for car parking  in Dungannon, but if they travel 10 miles down the road they do not have to pay  for it. Does he accept that that places the retail trade on an unequal footing  and an unlevel playing field? Should there not be a level playing field when it  comes to parking, with all towns either charging or not charging?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am grateful to the Member. With his characteristic directness, he did not  quite rain on the parade, but he certainly brought forward his direct approach.  However, it would have been too much to expect Lord Morrow to join in with the  celebratory mood.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The point that he raised is actually a fair one. There are  anomalies in the systems that have existed over a long period, and it will take  considerable work to equalise those. I am happy to look at particular issues in  particular areas, and I will readily do so. Although I have been in my post for  a relatively short period of time, I accept that I have inherited a system in  which anomalies exist around equity.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Copeland</strong>:  I also join in with the throng who welcomed the statement. Does the Minister  recognise that one of the implications that flowed from this issue was the  recent withdrawal of a number of bus services in east Belfast, which were, in  effect, subsidised by retail and other business interests? In one particular  case, the provision of the bus service was a condition of the planning  permission, yet, after the planning permission was granted, the developer in question  was declared bankrupt. When approaching these matters in the future, might it  be an idea to insist that the developer should pay a bond to provide for the  subvention of the bus service for an agreed period? That will mean that such  arrangements actually bring forward the benefits in reality that they promise  on paper.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am grateful to the Member. He raised a couple of issues. The first issue was  a general principle about how we approach such things and the second dealt with  a more specific case. I am happy to receive further information or  correspondence from him, and I will seek to address the points that he raised.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee has arranged to meet immediately upon the lunchtime suspension.  I propose, therefore, by leave of the Assembly, to suspend the sitting until  2.00 pm. The first item of business when we return will be Question Time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The sitting was suspended at 12.26 pm.<span style="font-style:normal; "> </span></p>

    <p class="OralAnswers-H1Heading"><a name="5"></a>Oral Answers to Questions</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H2DepartmentHeading">Enterprise, Trade and Investment</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Microenergy</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">1. <strong>Mr  McCallister </strong>asked the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment to  outline her plans to support microenergy generation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 279/11-15<a name="AQO279/11-15" id="AQO279/11-15"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster (The  Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment)</strong>: Microgenerators of  electricity are incentivised under the Northern Ireland renewables obligation  (NIRO), which is the main mechanism for supporting renewable electricity generation  in Northern Ireland. Approximately 90% of those receiving support are  microgenerators. In 2010, I increased the incentive level for new  microgenerators using wind, hydro and solar photovoltaic technologies. In  addition, in July this year I launched a consultation on a &pound;25 million  renewable heat incentive, which recommends support for generators, including  microgenerators, to install renewable heat technologies over the next four  years.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Why did Northern Ireland not embrace the feed-in tariff and renewable heat  incentive when the low-carbon buildings programme ended, as England, Scotland  and Wales did?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  I have indicated to the House on many occasions that we did not have the  authority to embrace the feed-in tariff (FIT) because we did not have the  legislative capability. It came about in England and Wales through a change  that came at a late stage to the Bill that was going through the House of  Lords. It, therefore, did not include Northern Ireland, and we could not bring  it in to Northern Ireland at that time. I did, however, ask officials to look  at whether the feed-in tariff would be better for Northern Ireland than what we  have currently, namely the Northern Ireland renewables obligation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The cost of the NIRO is spread right across the UK, so the  FIT would, more likely than not, apply just to Northern Ireland. In other  words, the cost would just be spread across consumers in Northern Ireland. That  would mean that it would cost more to implement the FIT for consumers here in  Northern Ireland. I did not think that that was a road that we would want to go  down, given the context of where we are on energy. However, as the Member will  probably know, electricity market reform is very much on the agenda of the  Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC). Officials are working with DECC  to ensure that Northern Ireland gets the proper incentivisation model moving  forward. So this is an area of flux, and we very much need to be in the middle  of it with DECC to make sure that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s voice is heard.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I am very interested in the Minister&rsquo;s answer to Mr McCallister. Is the  Minister indicating that her preference for microgeneration would be to have a  feed-in tariff sometime in the future? As the Minister probably knows, it has  been very successful in other jurisdictions. Given the paper that DECC produced  recently, it might be the way forward for Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  As the Chair of the Committee knows, we looked at the issue in the previous  mandate when he and his Committee carried out its work on energy. As I  indicated then, we did not have the legislative authority, but we did some  work. We very much wanted to look at the FIT as a possibility. We were not  going to close our minds to it, because it is happening in the rest of the  United Kingdom and, indeed, in the Republic of Ireland. However, I am concerned  that the costs associated with introducing and administering a FIT could  increase the cost to electricity consumers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I know that, in all the things that relate to energy, we  have to balance competing goals and look at sustainability and competitiveness.  We also have to look at the cost to consumers, which is always part of the mix  when I look at these matters. However, matters have moved on since the debate  that we had last year about having a FIT just for Northern Ireland. Electricity  market reform indicates the end of the renewables obligation in the United  Kingdom in 2017, and, therefore, we will probably have to look at a new  mechanism. We are discussing what that new mechanism will be, and I am sure  that the Committee will be very much involved in that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dunne</strong>: Is  the Minister aware of difficulties around connecting to the NIE grid system?  What pressure can the Minister put on NIE and the Utility Regulator to make such  connections more streamlined and cost-effective?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  I thank the Member for his question. This issue comes up from time to time  among people who are trying to manage wind generation and find they are having  difficulties not just with that wind generation but with the new anaerobic  digestion. People can have difficulties getting a price indication from NIE,  and there can be a delay with the grid connection.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Member probably knows, NIE operates under a  regulatory framework determined by the Utility Regulator as detailed in its  licence from him. It is required under that licence to provide a connection  offer to all generation connecting into the distribution system in line with  its connection charging statement. I think part of the difficulty is that the  price indication is given at the end of the planning process, so it does not  happen concurrently but consecutively. That causes some delay. However, I  understand that NIE has recognised that it needs to have adequate resources in  place to meet the increasing number of connection requests.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To me, an increasing number of connection requests  indicates that more and more people are availing themselves of a mix of  renewable energies. I understand that NIE is recruiting staff to deal with  connections as well as recruiting managerial and administrative staff. I hope  that we will see a more streamlined version of what is happening and has been  happening over the past number of years. If we are to have the amount of  renewables that we have targeted for ourselves, we need to get those renewables  connected to the grid.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lynch</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. In light of Community Energy  Scotland&rsquo;s experience, what plans does the Minister have to help communities  install microgeneration technologies to help achieve the renewable energy  target for 2020?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  I am not aware of the detail of the Member&rsquo;s question about Scotland, but I am  happy to take some information from him. I had an interesting exchange recently  with some members of the Fermanagh Trust about community benefits from wind  farms. I have asked officials to look at that issue because we know that, in  some cases, companies bring a great deal of community benefit to areas where  wind farms are hosted. I hope that other companies do the same. Huge investment  has been made in wind farms, and communities should benefit from that. I am  aware, given that conversation, that some areas of the United Kingdom seem to  benefit a great deal more than some of the host communities here in Northern  Ireland, and I have asked officials to look at that.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Golf</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">2. <strong>Mr  Hilditch </strong>asked the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment what  actions her Department has taken, and intends to take, to promote Northern  Ireland as a venue for international golf tournaments.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  (AQO 280/11-15<a name="AQO280/11-15" id="AQO280/11-15"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  The recent successes of Graeme &mdash; I had better get his name right &mdash; McDo&rsquo;ell or  McDow-ell &mdash; I always get it wrong; I think I will call him G-Mac &mdash; Rory McIlroy  and Darren Clarke offer us an unprecedented opportunity to promote Northern  Ireland as the home of golf. I have, therefore, asked the Northern Ireland  Tourist Board to work with key stakeholders to explore the possibility of  holding a major golf event in Northern Ireland. We have been investigating the  feasibility of securing the Irish Open in the next few years and aspire to  holding the Open Championship sometime thereafter.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hilditch</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her answer so far. Can she give us some assurance that  the tourism marketing strategies will include golf and, in particular, the  resource available on the north-east coastline?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  All politics is local, but golf is the world&rsquo;s largest sports-related travel  market, and therefore it is incumbent on all tourism partners to put golf right  at the top of their agenda. I take this opportunity to congratulate our Walker  Cup golfers Paul Cutler and Alan Dunbar. Yet again, two Northern Ireland  golfers have represented GB and Northern Ireland and have done us proud. That  is another indication of the importance of golf here.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are rolling out a golf tourism campaign of &pound;1&middot;8 million  to invite potential holidaymakers to come and visit the home of the champions.  That campaign builds on an already busy schedule of year-round golf promotions.  The Northern Ireland Tourist Board, as I have said, has big plans for the  future, but it has already supported golf events in the past, including the  Senior British Open and the Ladies Irish Open, and, as some of you may know, we  are working with the Galgorm Castle Golf Club. I was hosted there for the  second successive year in July. That is a hugely successful event, which gains  coverage on the Sky television network. It portrays Northern Ireland right  across the world, and golf remains very much at the heart of what I do in  tourism.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Flanagan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I do not know whether the Minister  will be delighted that I am not resorting to a parochial issue today. Given the  huge number of people who have travelled to New Zealand for the rugby World  Cup, has the Minister had or does she plan to have any discussions with  ministerial colleagues, either in the Executive or the Dublin Government, about  the possibility of the rugby World Cup coming to this island at some stage?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  As an Ulster rugby fan, I would be more than delighted to see the rugby World  Cup come to the British Isles, which would probably be a more realistic thing  to hope for. I will give all my support to that. We have a huge number of  events coming up in 2012 and 2013, one of which is, of course, the World Police  and Fire Games. That gives us a really good opportunity to promote Northern  Ireland and all that we have to offer in sporting tourism. It certainly forms  part of the package that I want to promote.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I call Mr Mike Nesbitt, who might return to golf perhaps.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Nesbitt</strong>:  You are very wise, Mr Deputy Speaker. Does the Minister agree that the  potential for achieving the Tourist Board&rsquo;s goals for more tourists spending  more per day and staying for longer lies not so much in the glamour of a  four-day golf event but in the more mundane, day-to-day attraction of golfers  who are here to play, rather than to watch?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  I think it is both, actually. The Member is right to say that we want to  attract more golf tourists to Northern Ireland, but the publicity that we will  generate by holding major tournaments here will help us to do that. One of the  reasons for the Home of Champions campaign that we have been running is to  attract golf tourists to Northern Ireland to play the courses where our  brilliant champions come from. That is proving very successful. The Member is  right about our tourism spend figures. We all know that golf tourists spend  considerably more than ordinary leisure tourists, and, therefore, if we are to  ensure that we reach those targets in the emerging tourism strategy, we need  more golf tourists and more spending of their money in our villages and towns  right across Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Electricity Prices</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">3. <strong>Mr D  Bradley </strong>asked the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment what  discussions she had with Power NI prior to the recent rise in electricity  prices; and what consideration has been given to reviewing energy management  structures. (AQO 281/11-15<a name="AQO281/11-15" id="AQO281/11-15"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  I have not met Power NI, but there have been a number of meetings over the  summer between my officials, Power NI, the Utility Regulator and the Consumer  Council as part of the annual electricity tariff review process. The Power NI  price increase of 18<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; ">&#8729;</span>6% is,  of course, disappointing and is challenging for both businesses and domestic  consumers, especially in the current difficult economic climate. However, the  price increase is largely due to rises in the wholesale cost of generation  fuels, resulting in increased power generation costs, which lead to higher  electricity charges. The increase in electricity tariffs has been scrutinised  and approved by the Utility Regulator, who has the responsibility for  regulating Power NI tariffs.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as  ucht an fhreagra sin, agus t&aacute; ceist agam di ar an &aacute;bhar ch&eacute;anna.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Has the Minister&rsquo;s Department assessed the effect of  greater competition, and is that providing any benefit to the consumer?</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  Of course, we want to see more competition in the Northern Ireland electricity  market. As the Member will know, Airtricity came into the market in June 2010  and provided a 14% reduction on NIE&rsquo;s &mdash; now Power NI&rsquo;s &mdash; prices. We are trying  to encourage other companies to come in. The Member may have heard the  Electricity Supply Board's (ESB) recent announcements about its intention to  come into the Northern Ireland market. Other companies want to come in, and the  more that do, the more competitive prices will become. We have already seen  that with just two players in the market. It is part of the wider European  strategy to have an integrated market, not just between us and the Republic of  Ireland but across the British Isles and in France. If we have a much broader  regulated market, we will see more competition, and we will see the benefit of  that in prices as well.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  Further to the issue of competitiveness, will the Minister join me in  expressing surprise that, setting aside the names and backgrounds of the  companies involved, although there is a cheaper product available, more people  have not taken advantage of the competitiveness of the market? That is a good  thing, and because there is no yellow pack electricity, the product is  identical and people can get it more cheaply than they could otherwise at a  time of rising prices. We should encourage people to shop around and get a  cheaper product.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  That is surprising, but part of the difficulty has to do with the privatisation  of NIE, which took place in 1992. A lot of people are still used to that brand,  and, in many ways, the fact that NIE has now rebranded to Power NI may signal  to people that there has been a change. Hopefully, people will start to look  around for different price levels. It is about looking not just at electricity  companies but at alternatives, such as gas. I know that the Member will join me  in hoping that we are able to develop gas provision in the west, so that we  give everyone in Northern Ireland the chance to have a choice of power supply  and are not solely reliant on electricity.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. In previous answers, the Minister  mentioned the hardship that some families and businesses, particularly small  businesses, face because of rising energy prices. Has she had any meetings with  the Utility Regulator or, indeed, some of the energy companies? There is a view  that NIE&rsquo;s pension fund deficit is responsible for the rise in costs and that  those are not just the result of the wholesale cost of energy.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  I raised the issue of the NIE pension deficit with the Utility Regulator, as  the Member would expect me to do. That deficit relates to the NIE transmission  and distribution business &mdash; the part that has gone to ESB. Power NI is a  separate entity, which is subject to its own price review process. The current  price increase is not being implemented as a result of the reported NIE pension  deficit. The Utility Regulator expects NIE to manage its pension costs within  the allowance provided in the current price control, which is in effect from  April 2007 until March 2012. Within that price control, NIE receives an  allowance for pension contributions. The pension deficit figure is on the distribution  side, not on Power NI&rsquo;s side.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member may not accept that wholesale costs have caused  the increase in power prices, but there has been a huge change across the world  over the past year that has had a big impact on the cost of fuel across the  world. The Japanese tsunami, the developments in the Middle East and many other  events have had an impact on the price of electricity. Although we will  continue to work with the energy companies, the Utility Regulator and the  Consumer Council, which, the Member will accept, provides a useful source of  impartial advice for energy consumers, the Executive are looking at what more  we can do to mitigate what will be a very difficult winter. We wholly accept  that a lot of people are already in fuel poverty. Indeed, from my perspective,  many small businesses also have difficulty with costs. Energy prices are  becoming a huge issue for a lot of small business, so we need to address it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  The Minister touched on the difficulty of controlling prices. What other steps  is she looking at to help the large number of people who are now moving into  fuel poverty?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  As the Member knows, the Minister for Social Development leads on fuel poverty.  Nevertheless, I met him before the summer, which was before we knew of the  scale of the price rises coming our way. We are formulating a strategy, and the  First Minister and the deputy First Minister have been exercised as to how we  might mitigate energy prices over the winter. We will say more about that in  coming weeks, and, towards the end of the month, I will say more about how we  can help to mitigate energy price rises.</p>

    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">4. <strong>Mr  Doherty </strong>asked the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment what  discussions her Department has had with Ofcom, the mobile phone industry and  the European Commission to secure a further reduction in roaming charges.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 282/11-15<a name="AQO282/11-15" id="AQO282/11-15"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  That is not a devolved matter. However, I am in discussion with Ofcom regarding  mobile phone coverage in Northern Ireland. Improving access to 3G services is  one of the key themes in my Department&rsquo;s 2011-15 telecommunications action plan  and, indeed, in our bid for funding under the broadband delivery UK initiative.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Doherty</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her answer. Given that excessive roaming charges are a  serious barrier to growing the all-Ireland economy, what steps is she taking  towards the introduction of an all-Ireland mobile phone tariff?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  As the Member knows, the matter was regulated by the European Union, which  introduced a regulation in 2007 &mdash; amended in 2009 &mdash; on the maximum that could  be charged for roaming charges, commonly known as the Eurotariff. The European  Commission set a target for the difference between national and roaming charges  to approach zero by 2015. Therefore, the issue continues to exercise the  European Commission.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have made my view clear to Ofcom, the regulator on the  matter, that roaming is an issue in Northern Ireland because we do not have  sufficient 3G coverage and are, therefore, often sent to roaming. The fact that  we do not have the 3G coverage that we should causes problems, and that comes  from the fact that the United Kingdom target of 90% 3G coverage is based on  population rather than geography. Therefore, if big cities are covered,  population coverage targets are hit. We have been suggesting and lobbying hard  for geographical targets, so that Northern Ireland has its own mobile phone  coverage target. The 4G spectrum will be on the market very soon, and we hope  that we can have a regional target for mobile phone coverage, which would help  not only with coverage but with roaming charges.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  In looking at mobile phone coverage issues, will the Minister take into  particular consideration areas in Northern Ireland that have absolutely no  coverage and have become black spots? I am thinking in particular of one area  in my constituency, Dervock, where, when you enter the village, your mobile  phone reception disappears. I welcome what the Minister did on the superfast  broadband for rural communities, but will she now give an assurance that she  will go back to the providers and continue to put pressure on them to deliver a  service for the benefit of our constituents?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  I thank the Member for his question. It relates to those targets again because,  unfortunately, providers will not deliver unless they are pushed to do so. I  understand that the target for 4G across the UK is 95%, but that will not help  people in Dervock because that target can be reached just by looking at  higher-density population areas. In the telecoms action plan for the coming  years, we need to push Ofcom and get that issue resolved and then see where  infill solutions are needed, in the way that we have done with broadband. There  is a need to do that for mobile, particularly with 4G, which will allow fast  data to be processed in a way that it is not at present.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  I follow on from Pat Doherty&rsquo;s question about roaming charges, which have a  significant impact, particularly in cross-border regions. People living in  Derry do not even have to be in Donegal to find themselves on O2 Ireland. It  happens frequently to hundreds of people, who incur additional costs. Given the  lack of co-operation from phone companies, particularly here, is it not time that  the Minister supported a call for Ofcom to implement regulations that will, as  Pat Doherty suggested, decrease roaming charges?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  If the Member had listened to my response to the first question, he would have  heard that that will come as part of a European solution in any event. I  recognise what he said about phone coverage. I will let him and the rest of the  House into a secret: when I am in Brookeborough, I am on something that I  should not be on &mdash; and that is the phone. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.] </span>Moving  swiftly on, what I am saying is that I am on a Republic of Ireland tariff.  There is a great need to have that matter sorted out and for the European  Commission to deal with the issue. It is a cross-border issue, and the  Commission really needs to get to grips with it. It tried to set a maximum  tariff, but I fully accept the Member&rsquo;s point. It should be a zero tariff;  there should not be any additional cost. However, that is an issue across  Europe. It is not just on this island; it is a matter for the whole of Europe.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Energy Strategy</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">5. <strong>Mr  Dickson </strong>asked the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment whether her  Department plans to produce an energy strategy to help improve energy security  and energy independence. (AQO 283/11-15<a name="AQO283/11-15" id="AQO283/11-15"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  A new strategic energy framework (SEF) was approved by the Executive, and I  published it in September 2010. It sets out clear priorities for Northern  Ireland&rsquo;s energy future over the next 10 years and identifies the key energy  goals of building competitive markets, ensuring security of supply, enhancing  sustainability and developing our energy infrastructure. The framework also  confirmed new renewable energy targets of 40% renewable electricity and 10%  renewable heat by 2020.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dickson</strong>:  What is the Minister&rsquo;s assessment of the strategy to date? What areas, if any,  has she already identified for improvement?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  Following the publication of the strategic energy framework, work was taken  forward on the development of a framework implementation plan. That is being  used to track the progress against the various SEF targets and will also be  used to update the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment regularly.  The framework was launched in September 2010, so it is too early for a yearly  adjustment or monitor, but I am sure that we will have that before the end of  the year, after which we will see what progress we are making on those issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Since the introduction of the Northern Ireland renewables  obligation (NIRO) for renewable electricity, we have moved from 3% to 10%.  Things are moving ahead. I accept that it is a difficult context to keep  pushing in that regard, particularly at a time of rising costs. As I have said  previously, however, there is more than one goal in our energy policy.  Sometimes, those are competing goals, and it is a matter of balancing all of  them.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H2DepartmentHeading"><a name="6"></a>Environment</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question 14 has been withdrawn and requires a written answer.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Waste: Illegal Dumping</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">1. <strong>Mr  Newton </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment to detail the total amount of  illegal waste dumped in Northern Ireland from the Republic of Ireland in the  last two years; and the fines and prosecutions that his Department has imposed  as a result. (AQO 294/11-15<a name="AQO294/11-15" id="AQO294/11-15"></a>)<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood (The  Minister of the Environment)</strong>: I welcome all Members back to the House after  the summer recess, and I thank the Member for his question, the answer to which  will surprise him as much as it surprised me. During the past two years, only  one incident of waste from the Republic of Ireland has come to the attention of  the Department. I say that that might be surprising because your intuition  would tell you that it might be more than that, given the history of illegal  waste disposal in the North. As of now, there has been only one report. I have  asked that we check with the PSNI to determine whether it is aware of any other  reports, but, ultimately, it is for the community to report to the Department  or the police if they are concerned about potential illegal waste being dumped  in the North of Ireland. As one of my officials said to me yesterday, the  absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his answer. Yes, I am surprised, given the extensive  amount of media coverage on the issue of illegal dumping. My perception was  that there is a strong cross-border racket in that area. Is the Minister  convinced that he is getting as much support as he requires from the statutory  authorities on the other side of the border to help establish whether it is a  minimal problem, as he has identified it, or whether there is a need for  greater coverage?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I thank the Member for his supplementary question. I cannot go into some detail  because, although matters are brought to my attention as Minister, the Northern  authorities, through the Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA), and the  Southern authorities work on enforcement, especially on criminal activity. They  work together and with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI in tracking and taking  action against those who may be involved in cross-border illegal waste  activities. However, I am certain that the co-operation is working effectively.  That is why, of the 17 sites where illegal dumping has been identified in the  North, two, in Trillick and Slattinagh, have been cleared. A site in  Ballymartin in County Down is currently being cleared. Those may have been the  critical sites, and, over the next five years, the other sites will be cleared  at a disposal cost of 100% to the Republic of Ireland authorities. Eighty per  cent of the cost of removing the offending items from the North to the Republic  of Ireland will be met by the Republic of Ireland authorities and 20% will be  met from our own coffers. That demonstrates that the Republic of Ireland  authorities are fully engaged and fully committed to the issue and are very  nearly fully funding it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Given that an element of dumping  is still taking place, does the Minister intend to reimburse the local  authorities, which sometimes have to fork out for the bill? It is still an  issue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I thank the Member for his question. The question framed by Mr Newton was about  dumping from the Republic of Ireland. If Mr Boylan has information that that  practice is continuing in a major or minor way, I ask him to bring it to the  attention of my Department, the NIEA, the PSNI and, indeed, the authorities in  the South. As I indicated, if we, as MLAs, members of the community and  citizens, have evidence, that evidence needs to be acted on. I encourage the  Member to fulfil that. I do not intend to establish a precedent that, where  there is illegal dumping of municipal or domestic waste that is then cleared by  councils, the responsibility to reimburse councils should fall to central  government. That would create a principle that is not sustainable. However, if  there are issues around cross-border dumping of waste, that is a responsibility  that falls to the respective Governments, North and South.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Nesbitt</strong>:  Has the Minister formed a view on whether the existence of three waste bodies  is the best way forward?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  That issue occupies my mind disproportionately at the current time, not least  because the process of procurement is advancing, and we may be entering a  critical phase in moving to some further developments with the three  procurement groups. It preoccupies my mind disproportionately because we are  talking about expenditure measured in hundreds of millions of pounds and  contracts that extend over 25 years, and the responsibility for paying for  those contracts falls to the ratepayers of our local councils. Clearly, given  the scale of the issue and costs, any Minister should be preoccupied with that  issue. However, a decision has been taken, and the outworking of that decision  continues. I have to be mindful of the contractual and legal situation that  arises, but I acknowledge that, as we proceed with the procurements &mdash; if that  is what emerges in terms of the affordability and deliverability of those three  procurement groups &mdash; we must not lose sight of the fact that, in the waste  hierarchy, recycling and reusing waste are the primary tools for dealing with  municipal and domestic rubbish.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Carbon Emissions: Public Buildings</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">2. <strong>Mr  Gardiner </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment what discussions he has had  with the Minister of Finance and Personnel in relation to the reduction of  carbon emissions generated by the public sector estate. (AQO 295/11-15<a name="AQO295/11-15" id="AQO295/11-15"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Before the Minister answers, I announce that question 3 has been  withdrawn.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I am grateful for the question, and I am grateful that Mr McNarry will not be  in the Chamber to ask his question. I should point out to the members of the  Ulster Unionist Party that I mean that with all due respect.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I should confirm that the issue of the government estate  does not fall to me but to the Department of Finance and Personnel. However, it  is important that we fulfil our obligations and stretch ourselves when it comes  to carbon reduction and emissions. That is why one of my interventions as  Minister &mdash; I view myself as an interventionist Minister &mdash; was to create a  cross-departmental working group to ensure that our obligations on carbon reduction  and carbon capture across Departments are pushed and pursued over the coming  period. That and the other interventions from my Department should allow the  North of Ireland to fulfil its obligations to Europe on the reduction of carbon  emissions. Indeed, as I intend to announce in the near future, I believe that  the North of Ireland is well placed to push itself further to achieve higher  levels of reduction in emissions than those that we are internationally obliged  to reach.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his response. There are vast swathes of surplus land  in public ownership. Will the Minister comment on whether Northern Ireland  Water land in particular could be better utilised for energy creation?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I want to be careful not to step on the toes of Mr Kennedy and his  responsibilities for regional development and NI Water. That issue has not come  on to my radar. Equally, however, I have created an interdepartmental working  group to interrogate the issue of emissions reduction in government and its  functions. Although NI Water clearly has a separate legal status from  government, I would like to think and I anticipate that, during conversations  at that interdepartmental working group, the Department for Regional  Development (DRD) might come to me and express a view on behalf of NI Water on  the very point that Mr Gardiner raises.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Flanagan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I think that we would all join in  welcoming the progress here on the reduction of carbon emissions in recent  years. However, has the Minister given any consideration to the reintroduction  of a carbon reduction scheme, which would have played a major role in that  progress and reduction?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  As the Member will be aware, our obligations and a lot of the policy direction  and strategy on carbon emissions emanate from the London Government. In that  regard, the Member might make a good point.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I concur with him, though, that good progress has been made  in recent years: compared with 1990 levels, carbon emissions have been reduced  by 20%. Given that our target is to reduce 1990-level emissions by 25% by 2025,  it is clear that we are on the right course to achieve those outcomes. That is  why I intend, if the Executive endorse my bringing forward a climate and  environment Bill, to include much more challenging emission targets in that  Bill than the 25% by 2025 that we are currently obliged to fulfil.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have to be careful because figures can disguise the full  facts. However, if we compare our targets with, say, Scotland&rsquo;s, on the face of  it we are substantially behind its potential achievement. Scotland aims for a  42% reduction on 1990-level emissions by 2025. Given the scale of the issue and  the size of the North, it seems to me that we should stretch ourselves, and do  so in a climate and environmental Bill, to do what Scotland has done in setting  challenging emission targets.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Agnew</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his answers so far. Does he agree that, in the absence  of a climate Act, our 2025 target of 25% should be seen as a minimum target? If  he will indulge me, does he also agree that we need to be careful that current  reductions are not due just to recessionary factors?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I thank the Member for his questions. It is the function of all Ministers to  indulge Members, so I will certainly indulge him further. Yes, that is my view:  I would not declare in the Chamber that I intend to include a more challenging  target in a climate Bill than that to which we are already committed unless I  believed that 25% by 2025 is the least that we can achieve. The economic  situation is not the least among many variables that would influence that  target. However, in my view, the direction of travel confirms that 25% will be  achieved. Consequently, achieving 35% and 40% is within our grasp.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as  na freagra&iacute; a thug s&eacute; go dt&iacute; seo. Ba mhaith liom an m&eacute;id seo a fhiafra&iacute; den  Aire.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Bearing in mind the outlandish views held by some previous  Ministers of the Environment, will the Minister indicate his own views on  global warming and climate change?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I thank the Member for his question. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat. Let me make my  view clear: I do not believe that the world is flat; I do not believe that  babies arrive in the mouths of storks &mdash; I checked that out with my wife <span class="Italic">[Laughter.] </span>and she tends to agree with me. I also have an  open mind when it comes to the age of the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway. However, I do not  have an open mind when it comes to the weight of science in relation to climate  change and global warming. People should have their views, but it is the role  of Ministers to take into account best evidence and the overwhelming view of  science. In my view, Ministers who disregard best evidence and the overwhelming  view of science do not fulfil their ministerial responsibilities as fully as  they should.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Waste Oil</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">4. <strong>Mrs  Overend </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment for his assessment of the  facilities currently in place that are capable of disposing of waste oil. (AQO  297/11-15<a name="AQO297/11-15" id="AQO297/11-15"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I am curious about where this question will go. I was about to read the answer  to Mr McNarry&rsquo;s question. The answer in respect of waste oil is that, under  current regulation, five facilities are entitled to accept, process and store  waste oil up to a limit of 10 tonnes a day.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Three of them are entitled to process the waste oil, with a  limit of 29,000 tons per annum. The NIEA monitors the impact of those  facilities on air and water quality. Civil amenity sites also have the  capacity, under licence, to store up to a limit of 1,000 litres of waste oil. I  assure the Member that the NIEA has regulatory authority for those five sites  currently under regulation and the civic amenity centres that have that  capacity. I am advised that the NIEA is attentive to that matter.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Overend</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his response. Disposing of waste oil is very  difficult, particularly for those working in the agriculture industry, which  amasses a considerable amount of the product. Will the Minister detail how easy  it is, or is not, to recycle the waste product?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  As I said in answer to the previous question, it is my practice to rely on best  scientific advice. Therefore, I will have to seek the best scientific advice  from the NIEA about the appropriate waste disposal models and mechanisms. I do  not deny that that is beyond my knowledge and competence. Nevertheless, if the  Member has concerns about the issue, will she bring them to my attention? I am  in conversation with the NIEA with regard to its monitoring, compliance and  enforcement regimes to ensure that any waste disposal, whether it is tyres in a  depot somewhere in the North, a waste disposal plant in the hills of the Black  Mountain or the disposal of waste oil, has the right enforcement and, if  necessary, more enforcements, compliance and monitoring in order to ensure that  waste, especially waste that is volatile or a threat, is properly managed. I am  anxious and attentive to that need.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lynch</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. What financial incentives are in  place to encourage the production of biodiesel from waste oil?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I suggest that the Member refers the matter to the Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment, whose remit covers the detail to answer that question. I  will bring it to her attention and ask her to reply to the Member.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Will the Minister give details of  the Department&rsquo;s waste management strategy, including any potential time frame  for its delivery?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I thank the Member for his question. I confirm that I am reviewing the waste  management strategy for Northern Ireland. If you compare where we are with  regard to waste management, recycling and reuse compared to 10 years ago, you  will see the progress that has been achieved. In 2002, we had municipal waste  disposal targets of around 8%. Now, depending on the council area, the positive  disposal of waste at civic amenity sites is between 26% and 50%. Overall in the  North, we are disposing 34% of waste at civic amenity sites in a renewable way.  Given all of that, and given the scale of the advance over the past 10 years  where we had 8% of renewable waste disposal and we now have 34%, it seems that  we should stretch ourselves on those targets as well. I will be bringing  forward proposals to encourage councils to have much more challenging targets  on the domestic municipal side and the commercial side because it is within our  grasp to achieve much more challenging targets.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Development: Unfinished Buildings</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">5. <strong>Mr A  Maginness </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment what plans he has to  address the problem of unfinished buildings, particularly in coastal towns  where developers have left sites in a state of dereliction. (AQO 298/11-15<a name="AQO298/11-15" id="AQO298/11-15"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I thank the Member for his question, which, I think, is opportune and timely.  Over the past number of weeks, I have been travelling around various parts of  Northern Ireland visiting the councils and hearing of their experiences on such  issues as local dereliction and development properties being left to go to rack  and ruin. If you go to Portrush, Portstewart, parts of Derry or parts of a lot  of our seaside and coastal resorts you will see evidence of growing  dereliction. Members are aware of the economic situation. In fact, just this  morning, we heard that property prices are lower now than they were last  November, so there has been a further downturn. The profile of dereliction in  various parts of the North is a matter that needs attention.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As a consequence, I am convening a group in Portrush in the  first week of October to interrogate the scale of dereliction in Portrush and  Portstewart, determine what further interventions might be required by local  and central government and determine what further obligations might be imposed  upon developers and builders who have not let sites be developed or allowed  them to be only partially developed. I am doing that in order to recognise  that, given the scale of this issue in many parts of the North, there needs to  be further co-ordination and intervention from all arms of government and the  private sector. Out of that, I am hoping that the issue of sites in a state of  dereliction might be mitigated, not least because of our challenging economic  circumstances and the need to grow tourism and tourism spend.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his very detailed answer. Everywhere you go, you find  eyesores of unfinished sites or buildings that are derelict for other reasons.  The Minister referred to interventions. Does the Minister envisage local  councils being given power to intervene and to take over sites or to dispose of  sites?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  Councils have certain powers in respect of sites that are in dereliction, that  might be a threat to public safety, that are creating a nuisance or that  otherwise need intervention. The Department for Regional Development and the  Housing Executive have the same powers. There may be an issue about how the  Housing Executive, councils and DRD are availing themselves of the full suite  of powers. I am mindful that councils will be somewhat hesitant to intervene,  given the scale of dereliction and the potential costs. One intervention power  that I am actively considering is for a planning authority to be allowed to  require the owner or occupier of derelict land, the condition of which is  adversely affecting the amenity of the area, to take whatever steps to clean up  the land that the authority specifies. That power already falls to the planning  authorities in England, and it is the type of power that might have relevance  here.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One thing is very clear. Given the scale of the issue and  our economic situation, interventions need to be identified and progressed,  because dereliction is going to be with us for a significant time, stretching  over a number of years, perhaps beyond the next decade. This is the right time  for government to show good authority, to intervene and to maximise the  response from all of those who are responsible, including developers and  owners.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  An issue that has been prevalent since before we entered into this economic  downturn and faced the dereliction to which the Member for North Belfast  referred is that of management companies. Will the Minister undertake to look  at that issue? There are people in all of our constituencies who are in homes  that they want to keep living in, but other properties have gone under the  ownership of the receiver, and the management company has collapsed. Will he  look at that issue again and see what can be done to address what is now a  serious problem in respect of management companies?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I thank the Member for his question. I will certainly put that on the agenda  for the gathering in early October that will interrogate the situation in  Portrush and Portstewart, the results of which I anticipate will have  application in other areas of the North where there is dereliction. Again, I am  going to be somewhat cautious as to whether the legal responsibility for the  conduct of management companies falls to the Department of the Environment.  That is a matter that I will take advice on. However, you are right. Given the  growth in apartment developments, especially in a lot of urban and coastal  areas in the North of Ireland, and given that, in many instances, the  management companies with responsibility for apartment developments have now  walked off the pitch, gone bankrupt or whatever the situation may be, it is a  matter that I will put on the agenda. Given that that meeting will be attended  by representatives of other Departments, councils and other agencies, I am sure  that I will get the best advice in respect of that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The Minister has outlined the examples  in Portrush and Portstewart, and those are obviously a result of the planning  process and the economic situation. Does he agree that some planning policies  have led to the situation in which developments in coastal areas are very much  out of character? Will he agree to look at those policies to ensure that those  kinds of developments do not take place again?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  The policy and legal answer to that is that the planning authorities have  deemed developments that you might consider out of character to be sufficiently  in character to pass the planning test. That is, if you like, the legal and  technical answer. However, I agree with the sentiment behind your question. I  have spoken to officials about how we are going to manage planning applications  for apartments in areas where there is a litany of existing planning  applications for apartments that have not been activated. It seems to me that  although we may have difficulty legally and procedurally to intervene, we are  just creating further problems for future years if we continue to allow  planning applications for apartments to be permitted in situations in which  there is a legacy and litany of existing planning applications. In one part of  one city in Northern Ireland,  3,600 apartment permissions for individual units have been approved, and still  we are processing a range of new applications thereafter. I agree with the  sentiment behind the question, even if those planning decisions must have been  consistent with the law, planning practice and planning guidance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have to say that, when it comes to the Planning Service,  although some useful progress was made over the previous mandate, I will leave  no stone unturned in identifying how we can use the planning system to achieve  best outcomes, especially best outcomes with economic benefit. I will outline all  of that in a statement to the Assembly in the very near future.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Recycling</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">6. <strong>Mr  Lyttle </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment to outline his Department&rsquo;s  plans to increase levels of recycling. (AQO 299/11-15<a name="AQO299/11-15" id="AQO299/11-15"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I thank the Member for that question. I touched upon this answer in my reply to  Mr McGlone. It seems to me that, given the technical and council improvements  in recycling, we should set more challenging targets. Therefore, it is my  intention to bring forward a proposal whereby the recycling target by the year  2020 should be at least 60%. Based upon experiences in other jurisdictions and  our direction of travel, I believe that that is achievable in respect of  municipal waste. The situation in respect of commercial industrial waste is  somewhat more complex, because the evidence and statistical base is not as  reliable as that for municipal waste. However, my officials are interrogating  that issue to see what more challenging targets could be met in that regard  also.<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>

    <p class="H4StageHeading">Accident and Emergency Services: Belfast</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots (The  Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety)</strong>: I am grateful for  the opportunity to make a statement to the Assembly on the important matter of  accident and emergency services in the Belfast Trust, particularly in the light  of the decision taken by the Belfast Trust on 7 September to close, on a  temporary basis, the emergency department in the Belfast City Hospital.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The change will take effect on 1 November 2011 and will  concentrate emergency department services in the Belfast Health and Social Care  (HSC) Trust on the Royal Victoria Hospital  and Mater Hospital sites. Those immediate changes  will apply until there has been time to resolve a permanent way ahead through a  full decision-making process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although this urgent decision on change is an operational  matter for the Belfast Trust, I assure Members and the public that my  Department has obtained assurances from both the trust and the Health and  Social Care Board, as the commissioner of those services, that the temporary  model of emergency department provision is safe and sustainable and that it  will deliver high-quality care. I have insisted that all parts of this service  have acted to ensure that there are appropriate emergency services for those  who need them in the Belfast  area and that the regional implications of that change, particularly in  relation to the South Eastern, Northern and Ambulance Service Trusts, are well  managed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For people living in the greater Belfast area and beyond, I want to see a  better emergency service than the one we have at present. The key to ensuring  that such services are effective is the availability of expert decision-makers  who know quickly what to do when faced with the wide range of conditions that  need attention unexpectedly in A&amp;E departments. For too long, we have been  trying to cover rotas of doctors, which spread the time and attention of those  key doctors too thinly, meaning that the situation is too vulnerable to  situations where junior doctors cannot get the advice that they need in  managing patients who arrive with immediate needs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I know that those changes will mean greater travelling  times for some people in Belfast.  The distance from the Belfast City Hospital  emergency department to that in the Royal Victoria is 1&middot;2 miles, and from Belfast City  Hospital to the Mater Hospital  it is 2&middot;1 miles. Those distances are short compared with those that are the  norm in rural areas, and they will be more than offset by the improved  sustainability and safety of a model of care in A&amp;E that ensures that the  right medical rotas are in place in a way that is simply not possible in the  status quo.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It has been claimed that the closure will place lives at  risk. I deplore such ill-founded and irresponsible comment. The clear fact of  the matter, based on expert clinical and management advice, is that, on the  contrary, seeking to maintain the status quo would create risks that can no  longer be managed safely. I recognise that there are major challenges in  managing that change, and that is why I want the Assembly and the public to get  behind the managers and clinicians in the Belfast Trust and all the other  affected organisations to do all that we can to help make that temporary change  work.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although this urgent and necessary change has to go ahead  now, my objective as Minister of Health is to ensure safe and sustainable  emergency department service provision in the longer term. Any decision on the  permanent reconfiguration of emergency department services will be a matter for  me as Minister to determine, and it is a decision that I will take only after I  have listened to what key stakeholders, in particular the public and their  representatives, have to say through a process of effective engagement and open  and transparent consultation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When I spoke to the Health Committee at its meeting on 20  July 2011, I advised it that immediate changes to A&amp;E service provision  would be required in the interests of patient safety. In the light of the  announcement by the Belfast Trust on 7 September, I want to further elaborate  on why those immediate and temporary changes are required.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The drivers for change relate to the safety and quality of  care; they are not efficiencies or cuts. In fact, it is likely that some  additional costs will arise in the short term as the trusts gear up to address  this change. I repeat: this change is necessary to ensure patient safety; it is  not a financial issue. I am very concerned that some people have chosen to try  to make it an issue of finance, and I ask the House to be responsible when  handling the issue today. The key issue is the need to ensure that there is an  emergency service for Belfast  and the nearby areas that works and meets the needs of the population.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The main reasons for immediate and temporary changes are: a  shortfall in recruitment of suitably qualified medical staff, particularly  middle-grade doctors; the need for adequate training and supervision  arrangements for junior medical staff, especially at night-time; concern  expressed by the Northern Ireland Medical and Dental Training Agency (NIMDTA)  and by the General Medical Council (GMC) in August 2011 regarding the current  level of supervision of doctors, especially on the Royal and Belfast City  hospital sites, thus requiring immediate action, which has now been taken; a  general shortfall in medical trainees in emergency medicine, not just in  Northern Ireland but in other parts of the UK; changes in the Home Office  immigration rules, which make it more difficult to recruit doctors from  overseas, including locums and middle-grade doctors; and changes in the working  practices of staff and the need to promote compliance with the European working  time directive, which was designed to promote safer patient care and enhance  the well-being of doctors who had previously worked very long hours.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My Department has been advised by the Belfast Trust and the  HSC Board that immediate changes to improve supervision of junior doctors have  been achieved, but that it has involved considerable rota redesign, significant  reliance on locums, support from other trusts, and the goodwill of medical  staff in the Belfast Trust. The HSC Board has highlighted that there would be  inherent vulnerabilities in sustaining such immediate changes beyond an  eight-week period; hence the need for further temporary change from 1 November  2011. For that reason, an emergency department service model involving  temporary closure of the Belfast   City Hospital  emergency department will be put in place from 1 November 2011.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">While further details on the actual model are being refined  by the trust, the end of October 2011 will provide sufficient time for other  local trusts, the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service and GP out-of-hours  services to plan for such a change. Inevitably, there will be additional  pressures in other trust areas as a result of that change, both in terms of  attendances at emergency departments and admissions to hospital. Therefore, as  part of the contingency planning arrangements, further work is required on  patient flows, and there will be a need for ongoing monitoring once the changes  are put in place. However, I am sure that Members will agree with me that  putting contingency plans in place now is a far better and safer approach than  having unplanned cessation of services, especially over the winter months.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let me say again: my first concern is the safety of patient  care. There is, and there will continue to be, a 24/7 emergency service in the  Belfast Trust. The changes are necessary to sustain that service provision. I  am advised by the HSC Board that the Belfast Trust has looked at other options,  including limiting opening hours in the Belfast City   Hospital emergency  department or putting in place a minor injuries unit on that site. However, the  option that the trust has chosen, that is, a 24/7 service on the Royal and  Mater hospital sites, will bring together greater medical consultant capacity  on those sites and will provide better access to specialists outside of normal  working hours and at weekends. That will be further complemented by specialty  trainees and locum cover.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Such arrangements will address the issue of supervision of  junior doctors, and rotas will be compliant with the statutory requirements of  the European working time directive. It is my understanding that that there  will be no staff reductions as a result of the changes, but that there will be  a requirement for staff reconfiguration.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Under those arrangements, an important category of patients  will continue to be admitted to the Belfast   City Hospital  when they face an unexpected need for urgent hospital care. That is because the  proposed plan is to have a medical assessment unit and an acute assessment  facility on site in the Belfast   City Hospital.  That will help patients with acute medical conditions, such as those who have  been referred by a GP, and it will provide rapid and timely intervention for  patients.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There will also be patient pathways in place for specialty  admissions when an urgent need arises; for example, for patients who have  certain cancers and renal conditions. Thus, while Belfast City Hospital will no  longer receive self-referrals from members of the public who, up to now, have  attended the A&amp;E department there, it is anticipated that a proportion of  people who need urgent care will still be admitted directly to the hospital  without having to be assessed at one of the other busy A&amp;E departments. To  meet the anticipated increase in demand at the Royal, additional funding has  been allocated to the Belfast Trust to undertake some refurbishment of the  A&amp;E department to create additional capacity. That will include a nine-bed  short-stay unit in the emergency department, which will be open 24/7 for  patients who require interventions with a length of stay of less than 24 hours.  In addition, an acute medical admissions unit will operate 24/7 for patients who  need a 24- to 48-hour length of stay. There is also a plan to relocate the eye  casualty to alternative accommodation. Those changes, together with enhanced  arrangements for ambulatory care, will assist in meeting the additional  pressures on the system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some minor works are also in hand at the Ulster Hospital,  which is likely to see additional patients as a result of the temporary  closure. Those works include upgrading and bringing back into use a disused  ward and creating a clinical decision unit to accelerate patient flow.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I reiterate the important point that the change will be  subject to close and ongoing monitoring, but, in the longer term, a strategic  decision will need to be taken on the provision of emergency department  services in the greater Belfast  area. As I said, that will be a decision for me, as Minister, to take. I will  take that decision only after a full and open process of consultation and  engagement. I anticipate taking a strategic decision on these matters later in  2012.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, I emphasise that the public also have a role to  play in making emergency services more effective by using the Northern Ireland  Ambulance Service&rsquo;s 999 calls only when needed. In addition, individuals should  think carefully about whether an emergency department is the most appropriate  place for treatment of their specific minor ailment or injury. For example, it  may be better to access treatment via their local GP or pharmacy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I commend the statement to the House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew  (The Chairperson of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public  Safety)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the  opportunity to speak on behalf of the Health Committee on this important issue.  I think that it is fair to say that the Committee is of the view that the  priority must be the provision of adequate accident and emergency facilities  across the Six Counties. A&amp;E services need to be configured in a way that  meets the needs of the entire population in an equitable manner. Although the  decision to change the provision of services must be given careful  consideration, we cannot forget that, ultimately, Belfast currently has three A&amp;Es within  two miles of each other. I am sure that many of us from more rural  constituencies would agree that that seems somewhat of an anomaly, given that  some people have to travel for over an hour to get to their nearest hospital.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In respect of the statement, has the Minister engaged with  the trade unions on the issue and sought to allay any concerns that they  raised?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Personally, I have not been engaging because this has not been my decision.  This is a decision that trusts are taking on a safety issue. Certainly, next  year, if we move to a long-term consideration of emergency services in the  Belfast Trust area and beyond, we will engage in full consultation before  arriving at a decision. I understand that trade unions are represented on the  board of the Belfast Trust. Therefore, they have had the opportunity to  participate in the decision-making process. They may well disagree with the  outcome, but they certainly have been part of the process that led to it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: I  realise that the Minister has dealt with some of this in his statement, but  there is still a view out there and an accusation being made that this is not  an issue of patient care or of ensuring the proper rotas of clinicians but is,  in fact, a money-saving budgetary exercise. Will the Minister comment on the  fear of many that this could be a way of saving money for the Department?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: As  it stands, it is actually costing the Department money, because we have to  carry out works at the Royal site to ensure adequate physical capacity to  provide the appropriate space for the clinicians, nursing staff, and so forth,  to operate.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This decision came about as a result of a number of  factors. First, in June, the NIMDTA carried out a report on the supervision of  junior doctors. The report raised some matters of concern for the Belfast  Trust. The Mater site got a B2, which indicated that there were some problems  but that they were not of serious significance and could be overcome. However,  in the report, the Royal and, indeed, Belfast City Hospital sites were given an  F grade, which is the lowest grading that they could receive, for the supervision  of junior doctors. That was followed up by the GMC in August, when it indicated  that it would withdraw services from the Royal and the Belfast City  sites within 24 hours if the trust did not respond to the issue of adequate  supervision of doctors. That is the critical nature of where we are today. This  is not to do with money. It is to do with the supervision of junior doctors  and, indeed, patient safety. Further to that, two registrars who were working  in the Belfast City Hospital  had given notice that they were to step down from their positions on 30  September 2011.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For all those reasons, it is physically impossible to  maintain a service across three sites in Belfast.  We have, therefore, arrived at a conclusion that we have based, first and foremost,  on patient safety. Some people may say that it was wrong for the GMC to  indicate that it was prepared to withdraw its support for the provision of  doctors at the site. However, a duty of care needs to be applied in such  instances. When junior doctors are left responsible for a decision-making  process that is way beyond their pay grade, there is the potential for them to  make the wrong decision, and had that happened, the GMC would not have  fulfilled its duty of care. So, I am not critical of it for highlighting its  concerns about the situation that prevailed in the Belfast Trust, particularly  at the two aforementioned hospitals.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I want to ask the Minister about two points. Given the numbers treated at the Belfast City Hospital&rsquo;s  A&amp;E unit, is he confident that the structures at the Royal and the Mater  will be able to cope? In an earlier answer, he mentioned that this will be very  much doctor and consultant led. However, will the physical infrastructure on  the other two sites be able to cope, given the many thousands of people who are  currently treated at the City&rsquo;s A&amp;E?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister stated:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;it is anticipated that a proportion of people who  need urgent care will still be admitted directly to the City&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Will he put a bit more meat on that and shore it up  to give people absolute confidence that they can be admitted directly to the City Hospital&rsquo;s  regional specialist facilities?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  thank the Member for his question. We are currently creating a nine-bed  short-stay unit in the emergency department at the Royal that will be open 24/7  for patients who require interventions and need to stay for less than 24 hours.  We will also have an acute medical admissions unit that will operate 24/7 for  patients who need to stay for between 24 hours and 48 hours and will enhance  the arrangements for ambulatory care. All of those things will help to deal  with the capacity issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The fact that the site will be covered by more senior  doctors will ensure that there is a much better flow through the site. In  circumstances where junior doctors are the decision-makers, they tend to engage  in more tests, do more X-rays and go through more processes to satisfy  themselves because they do not have the experience or the skills base. However,  in circumstances where consultants and registrars, who have considerable  experience in decision-making, are the decision-makers, the evidence shows that  there is a much better flow of patients. That will, therefore, make a  significance difference to the numbers of people who pass through.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The admissions unit at Belfast City   Hospital will largely be  for people who are patients of the hospital at, for example, the renal unit or  the cancer unit. Such people will have been referred there by their GPs. That  will take thousands of people directly to that facility, rather than their  having to go through the Royal&rsquo;s A&amp;E in order to be admitted to the City Hospital.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  statement. The Committee recognises fully the need for reconfiguration and  modernisation of emergency care throughout the North. However, given the  capacity issues that the closure will inevitably create for the remaining  A&amp;E departments in the greater Belfast  area &mdash; issues that Mr McCallister raised &mdash; the Committee is concerned that the  statement is premature and could ultimately undermine public confidence in the  Health Service. We can scarcely afford to do that at this time of austerity and  change.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Following on from the Minister&rsquo;s answer to the previous  question, when will the nine-bed unit be ready? When it is ready, will there be  more or less capacity than is currently available with the City Hospital&rsquo;s  A&amp;E department in operation? If the answer is less, can it really be viewed  as a clinical decision?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  When the Member arrived at the point at which he said that the statement was  premature, I was not sure whether he had listened to anything that I have said  thus far. When the GMC indicates that it will withdraw its doctors&rsquo; services  within 24 hours if we do not respond, and the emergency response by which a  level of cover is provided is not sustainable for more than a couple of months,  one needs to make decisions as opposed to procrastinating, as the Member has  recommended. It was not a hasty decision. It was an urgent decision that was  based on need and what was required to ensure that there is adequate medical  cover in the Belfast Trust area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As regards the number of cubicles, and so forth, that are  available, key to that particular issue is that there be adequate medical staff  cover at senior grades, so that the right people are in the right location to  see the community that needs their services. The Royal does not just act as a  local hospital but as a regional facility for a range of services. It is  totally unacceptable that the regional trauma unit is manned by junior doctors  six nights out of seven. If people want that kind of service, they may get  another Minister. It is not the kind of service that I want to be in place in  the Belfast Trust, which provides that service not only to local people but to  people right across the Province. We are not doing as well as we should on  trauma care. I want to look at and address that area. It will certainly not be  addressed by asking junior doctors to do that task. We need to move the service  on.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>:  The Minister mentioned the new trauma unit at the Royal. My understanding is  that that building will take some time to complete. Given that, in 2010, the City Hospital&rsquo;s  A&amp;E department had 40,000-odd patients, does he believe that the Royal will  be able to cope with the additional numbers that it will get as a result of the  department&rsquo;s closure?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: In  and of itself, it will not. However, it is anticipated that not all the people  who currently use the City   Hospital will use the  Royal. I mentioned that some people will still be admitted directly to the City Hospital.  We are looking at the potential for a further 10,000 attendances at the Ulster Hospital,  which has been making preparations for such a scenario. Three additional  A&amp;E consultants are being recruited to the Ulster Hospital,  which will help it considerably. Two of those consultants will be in place from  November 2011. Observation bed capacity in its A&amp;E department will be  increased. Additional nursing, allied health professional and social work  support will be made available to improve the flow of patients. An older ward  has been recommissioned and put in use to assist in that service.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Mater   Hospital is expected to  pick up an additional 6,000 attendances. To assist it to cope, it has enhanced  its facilities. The Mater already has a medical assessment unit in place. That  will be augmented by a short-stay unit, improvements in patients&rsquo; pathways for  chest pain and urgent review to reduce unnecessary admissions. It is also  working to improve the capacity in older people&rsquo;s services at the interface  between community and hospital care.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">So, a number of steps are being taken in hospitals other  than the Royal to make up the shortfall that would exist were the services at  the City Hospital to close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms P Bradley</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. During the previous mandate, I worked  in Antrim Area Hospital.  In that time, we had the downgrading of Whiteabbey  Hospital and the Mid-Ulster Hospital,  and I saw at first hand how that affected service users and staff after what  seemed like little or no planning. I welcome that you seem to have put  preparations in place for both the Royal and the Mater.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Did the reconfiguration of services just start in May?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  From what I can see, there have been difficulties with recruitment for some  time, which would have been going on before May. With regard to the services  that are provided, we have had to make the decisions based on the availability  of doctors, particularly those at a senior grade, and there have been  challenges with getting enough junior doctors. That led to the situation in Lagan Valley   Hospital where hours had  to be reduced. Initially, the hours were supposed to be reduced to cover 9.00  am to 5.00 pm, but we managed to get that up to 9.00 am to 8.00 pm. The trust  is working to extend those hours further, and, ultimately, we are hoping to  have a 24/7 operation at Lagan   Valley again, hopefully  with the support of local GPs. That work has still to be done.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The issue that we have is that there are considerable  problems in recruiting doctors to A&amp;E departments. The general public need  to recognise that much of the work that doctors engage in is carried out in  unsociable hours and that the interface that they have can very often be with  patients who do not fully appreciate the care that they are receiving and who  can engage in a very unbecoming way with medical staff, which is wholly  unsatisfactory. Therefore, it should not come as a surprise to Members that  doctors do not very often make A&amp;E their first choice. There are many  better options for them when it comes to the hours that they are expected to  work and to the appreciation that is shown to them by members of the public,  which does not involve violence or foul language.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement, for setting out his thinking on this  issue and explaining how he arrived at the conclusion that, as he said, we have  come to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is a controversial decision, particularly in south Belfast, and it merits  explanation. I note that he says that there will be an extra 10,000 visits to  the Ulster Hospital and that he has put steps in  place for that, including three extra consultants. The Ulster Hospital  was designed for 30,000 visits a year, yet it is currently receiving 70,000 a  year and we are still some time away from the new A&amp;E department being  ready there. Also, the new critical care unit at the Royal, which Mr Spratt  mentioned, is under construction and is probably still a couple of years away  from completion. As a result, the A&amp;E in the Royal is in temporary  buildings.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My question, therefore, is about the Mater and City Hospitals.  The Minister makes the argument that we cannot have three A&amp;E departments  in Belfast and  that we must have two. Why did he choose to close the A&amp;E department at the  City Hospital and not that at the Mater,  bearing in mind that the proposed future for the Mater is as a local hospital  with a minor injuries unit, whereas the City will continue to be a major acute  hospital and a teaching hospital? Will he explain why he made that decision?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  thank the Member for his question. It is relatively simple: if we go back to  the NIMDTA report, the Mater received a B grade for its supervision of doctors  whereas the City Hospital and the Royal received F  grades.<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Additionally, the registrars who resigned did not  do so from the Mater Hospital; they resigned from the City Hospital.  Therefore, clinically, it was considerably easier to maintain the service in  the Mater Hospital  than in the City Hospital.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I did not make any decisions on the matter. This was an  operational decision, taken by the Belfast Trust in response to patient safety  issues and to ensure that patients are treated and cared for in an appropriate  manner. It was also taken to ensure that junior doctors receive appropriate  guidance, and it is absolutely critical that that should happen. Where will we  be in a number of years&rsquo; time if junior doctors continue to carry out work  without getting proper guidance and support? Guidance is a key element in their  training, and if we do not adequately and properly train doctors it will leave  us in a bleak and dark place.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  As the Minister considers this decision to be operational rather than  ministerial, will he confirm that, even with the new facilities that are to be  added to the Royal Victoria Hospital, fewer beds will be available in A&amp;E  to the people of Belfast than are currently available in the Royal Victoria and  Belfast City hospitals? Does he have confidence in the Belfast Trust, given  that it appeared to allow a situation to evolve, over what one would presume  was a fairly considerable period, which led to an operational decision being  taken that is clearly not in the interests of the people of this city?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  am satisfied that the current Belfast Trust management are taking decisions  that are soundly based and will ensure that patient safety is a top priority. I  am also satisfied that they are looking for the best outcomes for those who  attend hospital.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member has the wrong focus when it comes to the issue  of beds; it should be on the people who actually man the hospital wards. We  will have the appropriate personnel delivering services in the A&amp;E  departments, which is currently not the case. It is critical that we get the  right people to carry out those services.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member may be satisfied if a member of his family were  to attend one of those services late in the evening with internal bleeding or a  serious trauma and to be treated by a junior doctor, as that would allow two emergency  departments to be kept open. I prefer to travel 1&middot;2 miles extra and ensure that  I am treated by someone who has the experience and skills to deal with such a  major emergency.<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Principal  Deputy Speaker</strong>: Order. I remind Members that when a question has been asked  the Minister has the Floor. An Adjournment debate on this issue is scheduled  for later today, during which everyone can say their piece.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Capacity is being increased at the Royal Victoria and Mater hospitals, and the  patterns of patient flow and decision making will also change. We anticipate  that there will be a lower requirement on beds. There will be much better  patient throughput as a result of having skilled people in place who can  provide support and advice to younger doctors and ensure that decisions are  made in a timely and appropriate manner.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dunne</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. I am very much aware that the A&amp;E  department at the Ulster   Hospital in Dundonald is  overstretched. How can it be expected to cope with more attendances as a result  of the proposed changes?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  thank the Member for his question. I covered the issues around A&amp;E  departments earlier, and it is absolutely critical that the appropriate cover  is in place. As things stand, the Ulster   Hospital deals with the  greatest number of A&amp;E patients. That may change after the changes are  made. The Ulster Hospital has been looking for new  consultants for its facility. The number of consultants will be increased from  five to eight. Two of those people will be in place for 1 November, so the Ulster Hospital  will have seven of the eight consultants required. The Ulster Hospital  is also changing the facility itself, and patient flow will be improved  considerably as a result of the actions taken.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We recognise that the Ulster Hospital  has been under a fair degree of pressure, particularly when the norovirus  struck the wards over the summer. There was a very poor patient flow in that  situation, but the steps that have been put in place should more than offset  the additional numbers that are coming in.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Lewis</strong>: I  also thank the Minister for his statement and for the clarification. When will  the new critical care building at the Royal be operational? Does this change  impact on those plans? Will there be an impact on Antrim Area   Hospital?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: It  will probably be 2013 before the new building at the Royal comes into play. It  would have been desirable to wait until then to make these changes.  Nonetheless, it was necessary to move ahead now because of the issues that I  have outlined in today&rsquo;s discussion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The previous Minister&rsquo;s idea was that we should wait until  the Royal site facility and the Dundonald facility were open. Under his plans,  the Ulster Hospital facility would not be open  until 2020. That type of procrastination will not deal with the issues in the  health service. We cannot wait for nine years to deal with issues. We need to  deal with them now. That is very clear to me as we move ahead on this issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There may be some new attendances at Antrim Area   Hospital. As things  stand, a number of people from the Antrim Borough Council area attend the Belfast City Hospital  site. The Northern Trust has been alerted to that. It has been indicated to  them that they need to prepare for additional throughput at Antrim Area   Hospital as a result. As  the Member well knows, there have been a considerable number of problems in  Antrim. Those have been improved on to some extent. We are building a new &pound;13  million facility at Antrim   Area Hospital,  which I believe will considerably assist inpatient throughput and flows.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  Is it the case that what is termed the &ldquo;temporary closure&rdquo; of the City Hospital  A&amp;E department is but language deployed to give a soft landing to what is  intended to be a permanent closure? Does the Minister think that the closure  will be temporary?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  This decision has been taken because of circumstances, and, therefore, it is a  temporary decision. Should we decide that the Belfast City Hospital A&amp;E  department should be closed permanently, we will go to the public and have a  proper public consultation exercise. We will engage with the public, the trade  unions and others before making such a decision. This is not a ministerial  decision on the permanent closure of a hospital but a trust&rsquo;s response to an  urgent need and an urgent circumstance that has arisen for it. That is why the  closure is described as temporary.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  In the last paragraph of the Minister&rsquo;s statement, he refers to the public  having a role to play. I totally agree with that. Does he have any plans to  launch a publicity campaign to ensure that the public knows when to go and when  not to go to accident and emergency in order to reduce the number of people  waiting in those departments? As I understand it, the number of people waiting  for more than 12 hours is increasing. Would a publicity campaign help to direct  people away who should not be at an A&amp;E unit?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: It  may well help. Another thing that may help, in which the Member may be  interested, is a pilot scheme running in the Southern Trust in which a GP is  engaged in triage. That has been tried in Manchester  and, as a direct result, 20% of admissions to the A&amp;E unit have been  screened out. We are not in a position to indicate whether that will happen at  the Royal site, for example, from 1 November, but the Belfast Trust is working  in close consultation with the Southern Trust to identify the success or  otherwise of that project. We may well be in a position to install a GP in  triage, and, if that is the case, I think the general public will quite quickly  get the message that they can come to A&amp;E but they will not necessarily be  admitted if the GP does not deem it suitable to do so.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One way or another, the message needs to get out that going  to A&amp;E should not be the immediate response to every illness and that often  people should make an appointment with their GP. A GP will respond quickly when  people need to be seen quickly. It is not the case that people with a  significant problem would be asked to wait for 12 or 14 days; they should be  seen within 48 hours.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I speak as a South Belfast  representative, although I am acutely aware that we could be dealing with a  decision around the Mater   Hospital or the Royal  this afternoon. I am very concerned. Our job is to ensure that the public have  maximum confidence in the decision taken, and I wish the Minister well in his  ability to instil that confidence. Our primary purpose here is to ensure that  patients and the general public have access to the best possible emergency care  after this decision.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement and his response to many  of the questions. From my point of view, whatever the source of the current  problem, we need to look at many more fundamental issues, perhaps including  long-term management issues, but that is a discussion for another day.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In trying to maximise public confidence in this decision,  can the Minister assure the House that the contingency plans that he referred to  in some detail will be in place by 1 November?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  That is the plan. I cannot say that this decision will work perfectly in a  highly pressured environment on a January night. It did not work perfectly last  year or the year before, and it is likely to face significant pressures this  year, next year and for further years because those peak periods can create  anomalies and problems. I believe it will be a better service than is currently  available, because we will have the appropriate clinicians available to see  people who require emergency care, particularly people who have had major and  catastrophic incidents such as heart attacks, strokes, major traumas, road  traffic collisions etc. Those people need appropriate care, and this will help  us to ensure that that care is in place and that the right people will be there  to deal with people who need that emergency care.</p>

    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="8"></a>Private Members&rsquo; Business</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Policing: Part-time Reserve Gratuity Scheme</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Principal  Deputy Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour  and 30 minutes for the debate. The proposer will have 10 minutes in which to  propose the motion and 10 minutes in which to make a winding-up speech. All  other Members who wish to speak will have five minutes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hussey</strong>: I  beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes with regret the deduction of  National Insurance and income tax from the &pound;20 million part-time Reserve  gratuity scheme; expresses concern at the security breach which put the  identity and well-being of around 6,000 former part-time RUC officers at risk;  and calls on the Minister of Justice to make a statement on the matter and  detail what action has been taken in light of the security breach.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I begin by declaring an interest in the proposals as  chairman of the Royal Ulster Constabulary GC Association part-time officers&rsquo;  welfare group. The motion, which I have the honour of moving, relates to all  part-time officers who served between 1970 and 2009, but the vast majority will  have had Royal Ulster Constabulary service only.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Over the 12 years of the campaign to recognise the service  of the part-time Reserve, many Members past and present were lobbied, as were  direct rule Ministers. The last Ministers to be lobbied were the Chancellor of  the Exchequer, the Secretary of State and the Prime Minister, who paid tribute  to the service of the brave men and women of the part-time Reserve and referred  to the great debt that was owed to them. Clearly, debt has a different meaning  in the office of the Prime Minister than it does in reality.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">From day one, the intention was to provide some form of  financial recognition for the service of part-time police officers through what  have been described as the darkest hours of the Troubles. To those of us  prepared to wear the uniform, it meant many hours spent away from our home with  little financial reward. In the late 1970s, 100 hours of duty equated to a  take-home pay of &pound;50 to &pound;60 per month. Many part-time Reserve women served for  over 25 years with the Reserve, it being their only form of employment, and, on  retirement, their only pension entitlement was the state pension.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It would be wrong of me to proceed without mentioning the  72 who lost their life as a result of terrorist activity, the two part-time  PSNI officers who lost their life as a result of a road traffic accident in  Warrenpoint, the hundreds who were forced from their civilian jobs and those  who were retired from the police as a result of injuries on duty and did not  receive a pension. Although I will deal with the security breach later in my  speech, I advise now that eight of those who were murdered had left the RUC at  the time of their death.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The &pound;20 million that was allocated to fund the package was  negotiated at the Hillsborough talks, and it was always our belief that that  payment would be a tax-free lump sum. No one expected a huge financial  windfall, but it was believed that the payment would be a reasonable  recognition of service. The proposals that were put forward for the scheme by  the association were not accepted in their entirety by the Department of  Justice. Amendments were made to several of the proposals, and it was not until  fairly late in discussions that tax implications were mentioned.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Reference was made to other financial settlements,  including those of the Royal Irish Regiment and the Northern Ireland Civil  Service, where settlements were made with the tax liability being met by the  employer. Deals were made by the various Departments with Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue  and Customs, and the tax liability was met and payments made gross to  recipients. That was not the case for the part-time Reserve: tax at 20% was  deducted from earnings up to &pound;2,917, with 40% being deducted from the balance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I was awarded a gross amount of &pound;8,314&middot;41. Tax of &pound;2,345&middot;80  was deducted from that figure, as was &pound;991&middot;81 for the employer&rsquo;s National  Insurance and &pound;211&middot;48 for the employee&rsquo;s National Insurance, leaving me a net  payment of &pound;4,765&middot;72. For your information, I served for 26 years and was in  the highest band &mdash; band six. Most of those who received that payment are not  40% taxpayers and never will be, but they are now obliged to claim a refund of  the higher-rate tax that applied. I wonder what it cost the Treasury to process  all the repayments. Clearly, Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government have received a  substantial return on the &pound;20 million that they made available. In my case, of  the &pound;8,314&middot;81, they took back &pound;3,549&middot;09 &mdash; approximately 42&middot;5% of the award. The  debt owed by the people of Northern Ireland to the part-time Royal Ulster  Constabulary Reserve cannot be calculated in pounds, shillings and pence, but  the fact that it was considered necessary to tax the payment indicates that the  value put on the service of those brave men and women by Her Majesty&rsquo;s  Government was not very high.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will move on to the way in which the information about  the payment of those awards was issued. Large white envelopes were used. In my  case, the information contained in the window included &ldquo;Omagh BT78 1HU&rdquo; and the  wording &ldquo;Dear Mr Hussey, part-time Reserve gratuity payment&rdquo;. The Northern  Ireland Civil Service and, indeed, the Northern Ireland Office and those  associated with it are required to adhere to the protective marking scheme. On  considering the marking, an official has to determine what the compromise of the  information would be likely to do. For information to be treated as  confidential, one of the definitions is that it would</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;prejudice individual security or liberty&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">For it to be treated as secret,</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The compromise of this information or material would  be likely &hellip; to threaten life directly, or seriously prejudice public order, or  individual security or liberty&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It could be argued that both those definitions  could apply, but, probably, the confidential marking would have been  appropriate. That being the case, there are specific guidelines for the  transmission of such information, which were completely disregarded.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I was made aware of the security blunder on Saturday 20  August, when I received a telephone call from a former Reserve member. She said  that it now means that anyone who handled and delivered this envelope knows  that someone living at her address has a connection with the RUC Reserve. She  asked whether anyone who was administering that process had any common sense.  She said that her home was attacked in 1986 when she and her mother were alone  in the house. She told me that they had to relocate immediately, staying for  some time in the section house. She was concerned not only at putting her  family through the worry that her personal details have been put in the public  domain but that this serious breach of the Data Protection Act 1998 could have  happened to other colleagues who reside in areas of the Province which, for  them, still carry a personal security risk. My personal security is not a  particular problem, because, as a politician, I am in the public domain, but  that lady was clearly very upset when she spoke to me. I have removed all the  personal information that she passed to me and I have referred the many e-mails  that I have received from colleagues directly to the Department of Justice and  the PSNI.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Before closing, I want to read to the House a letter that I  received from a member of my committee, a lady who is a personal friend and for  whom I have the highest regard:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Thirteen years ago my car was set on fire, my house  was petrol bombed. I was quickly moved with very little belongings to another  location, and then spent six long months finding what I thought was the house I  was going to settle into. At great cost to ourselves and none to the Government  my husband had security cameras, recording systems and Sapphire fitted to the  house. My mortgage had to be increased and my payment duration extended to  enable me to live in an area the Police Security Branch and my family  considered safe. My belongings when I finally retrieved them from storage were  practically destroyed not counting what had been stolen and I had to start all  over again &hellip; After ten months sick leave from work, a transfer to another job  location, a different car I finally lived with the matter until Saturday  morning. I spend gallons on diesel going different routes to and from work,  picking who my friends are, where I do my weekly grocery shop, updating myself  with security alerts, looking under my car, sitting in the house in the dark  rather than put the lights on, or worse still having my blinds and curtains  closed when not needed, and have nothing to do with my Police colleagues  outside of what social life I have.</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">Since Saturday morning I have had flashbacks. Last  night at 02:30 hrs I was sitting at the living room window drinking coffee and  playing everything back in my mind of the horrific night my family was moved  because of the job I had. At lunch time today I asked to go home from work as I  can&rsquo;t get this out of my mind. My stomach is heaving at the thought of having  to go through a move again and at the moment feel physically sick&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The words of my colleague say it all.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a question that has to be answered: what action  has the Minister taken to ensure that serving and former officers are  guaranteed safety in their home? Many who were prepared to risk their life for  the security of the Province have had their personal security threatened by  gross incompetence. They feel that they have been treated with contempt by the Department  of Justice and by Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government. A grovelling apology to the House  will not be sufficient to satisfy the upset that this farcical set of  circumstances has created.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Anderson</strong>:  I can certainly stand here this afternoon and give my full support to the  motion. I appreciate all Mr Hussey&rsquo;s work and the role that he played as chair  of the RUC George Cross Association part-time officers&rsquo; welfare group, and I  know that he previously expressed frustration about the failure to make meaningful  progress in the past. But we are here today and we have made progress, and I  know that my party played a great part in securing the &pound;20 million.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I turn to the issues addressed in the motion. It is  certainly a disgrace that the brave men and women of the part-time RUC and the  widows of those who have passed on are being treated in such a shoddy manner.  All who served in the police during the Troubles displayed great courage, but  part-time RUC officers were especially vulnerable because of their civilian jobs.  Out of love for their country, they proudly wore the uniform of the RUC, and  the terrorist threat could not have been contained without them, a fact that  has been acknowledged by the full-time force. Belatedly, they were given some  hope of recognition, when the announcement that they would receive a gratuity  was made in early 2010. They have now been left with a bad taste in the mouth,  and they feel shabbily treated.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion addresses two concerns. First, it is a disgrace  that the gratuity is not exempt from tax and National Insurance. It seems to me  that there has been a lot of ducking and weaving by the Secretary of State and  the Justice Minister. The Secretary of State tells us that it is a matter for  the Treasury in London.  The Justice Minister tells us that he is merely the administrator of the  scheme. Those two men are in positions of authority and influence, so they  really ought to display more guts and determination. Where there is a will,  there is a way. I suspect that officials in the Treasury and the Department who  designed the details of the scheme probably feel a lot happier. After all, by  including tax and National Insurance, they have managed to cut costs, and they  know that only a small percentage of former reservists will query the matter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I know of an elderly man who served from 1972 to 1990. He  is now 82, yet he had a large part of his gratuity taxed at 40%. As an elderly  pensioner, is he likely to be earning in excess of &pound;42,000 a year? He took time  to seek professional advice and challenged the calculations but, instead of  giving an answer, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) asked him how the  gratuity scheme was taxed. Take note: he was asked how the scheme is taxed.  Surely, that says it all.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The second issue in the motion is potentially even more  serious, because it compromises and endangers personal safety. Those who had  been looking forward to receiving their gratuity are now feeling vulnerable and  threatened. As we all know, the payments were issued in envelopes that clearly showed  that they contained a part-time Reserve gratuity payment. The Minister cannot  wash his hands of this fiasco. It happened on his watch, and his officials have  blundered badly. An apology from the Minister is not enough. His reputation and  that of his Department have been damaged. I look forward to hearing the outcome  of his review of the incident, but, to be honest, this place is coming down  with reviews or promises of reviews. A review cannot undo the damage that has  been done.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">All in all, this has been a comedy of errors, but those who  feel threatened and vulnerable are certainly not laughing. Are we to repay  their bravery by short-changing them and causing them to experience the stress  and worry that they and we thought was a thing of the past?</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. N&iacute; bheimid ag tabhairt taca&iacute;ochta  don r&uacute;n. We will not be supporting the motion. Our opposition to the gratuity  payment is on public record, so I will not rehearse that today. It follows that  the idea that a gratuity payment, in the circumstances in which it was paid,  should be tax exempt will lead us not to support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The latter part of the motion is something with which there  are issues. It was publicly articulated that people felt vulnerable as a result  of how the Department handled the correspondence to those involved. The  Minister has publicly apologised for that, and we wait to hear the details  today of how his Department will take steps to ensure that people are not  exposed to such vulnerability in future. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  We are very happy to participate in today&rsquo;s debate. We are also happy to express  our support to those in any walk of life who seek to have their rights as  workers upheld. It is the view of the SDLP and, I think, that of the vast  majority of people in this region that no matter what political context you may  wish to put on the part-time Reserve and no matter how you wish to view the  role that it played in contemporary policing in this region, those are separate  issues from the rights of people who did a job to receive fair and equal  treatment at the point at which they ceased to do so. It is for that reason  that the party that I represent was always clear in its advocacy of equality  and parity of treatment for part-time reservists along with any other former  members of the RUC. It is for that reason that we have sympathy with the lobby  that has been represented today in the House by Mr Hussey, which is one that is  based on pretty sound grounds of equality and fairness. I do not wish to take  the conversation much further on that point.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The second part of the motion relates to what has become an  all-too-common occurrence in recent months; a failure to uphold the security of  people in our community. Again, irrespective of how one may wish to interpret  the context in which an individual may have a duty to be protected, the bottom  line remains that every member or former member of any public service  organisation has a legitimate expectation to be protected and to have the duty  of care of his or her employer upheld. It is exceptionally disappointing that  people, some of whom will have been directly or indirectly victimised by the  Troubles, should have their security breached. It is an exceptionally serious  matter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with Mr Hussey: it takes more than just an apology  to fix it. It is the same for a former police officer as it would be for anyone  else in any other aspect of life where their employer has failed in a basic  duty of care towards them. We will happily support the motion on grounds of  basic fairness and equality for all.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dickson</strong>:  I echo the words of Mr Hussey in the Chamber this afternoon and place on record  my gratitude for, and recognition of, the bravery of the RUC Reserve George  Cross. I also express my regret that deductions of tax and National Insurance  were made from the part-time Reserve payment scheme. Unfortunately, however,  the Minister is playing the hand that he was dealt. People may not like that,  but it was agreed by others prior to devolution and was handed to him in a way  that he was unable to change, despite his efforts to do so. The figure of &pound;20  million was agreed before the devolution of policing and justice, and Her  Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs can operate only within the parameters of  existing tax and National Insurance law in the United Kingdom. Therefore, the  Department must administer the scheme that was set out in accordance with the  law.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I know that the Minister has done all that he can to press  the issue with the Chancellor of the Exchequer on several occasions, but,  unfortunately, it appears that any opportunity to improve the details of the  scheme arose long before he was given the task of delivering on a commitment  that was made by others. Once that die was cast in the initial agreement,  little or nothing could be done to reverse the situation, but I commend the  Minister for his efforts.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also add my expressions of concern about the gratuity  scheme security breach. Clearly, that is very disturbing and a worrying  situation for the part-time reservists and their families whose security has  been potentially compromised. Having placed themselves in harm&rsquo;s way in the  past to protect the people of Northern    Ireland, they certainly deserved better, and  I regret this administrative blunder that has led to such distress. However, a  very important point has to be made. The error was made by administrative staff,  not by the Minister. The Minister does not lick the envelopes or put the stamps  on. For government to function, there must be reasonable reliance on public  servants to undertake administrative tasks efficiently and effectively.  Unfortunately, the incident has highlighted a particular area of incompetence.  However, the Minister cannot involve himself in the administrative duties of  the Department because that would undermine his ability to conduct his duties  effectively, yet some Members in this Chamber and elsewhere are set on blaming  him.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps the &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo; had it right when it stated  that the calls for the Minister&rsquo;s resignation are &ldquo;a foolish knee-jerk  reaction&rdquo; and that he could not be blamed for the administrative error. The  paper also complimented the Minister on his quick and decisive reaction. I echo  those compliments and commend the Minister for his swift response in initiating  an urgent security assessment, establishing a helpline for those who had  concerns about their security. I am sure that Mr Hussey referred all of his  colleagues to that helpline. Indeed, when the organisation that was providing  that helpline struggled to cope with the number of calls, the Minister&rsquo;s  Department put in additional staff to strengthen the service that was being  offered.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has tackled the error swiftly and efficiently,  and I place on record my thanks for his efforts. I support the motion, and I  ask the Minister to outline to the Assembly what steps are being taken to  ensure that the mistakes that were made in this case are identified and what  lessons can be learned from it for the future.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: I  join other Members in paying tribute to the courage and dedication of those who  have served the community for many decades and acted as a bulwark between the  ordinary decent citizens of the Province and the terrorists. The part-time RUC  Reserve did a magnificent job in very difficult conditions. Indeed, I remember  talking to one member of the part-time Reserve in my constituency who told me  that, at night, when he was out doing road checks, he often came across known  IRA terrorists who had previous convictions for murder and other heinous deeds.  During the daytime, he was delivering bread to the doors of the very same  individuals. That is the level of risk that those men &mdash; the vast majority, of  course, were men &mdash; were placing themselves in. He was on his own, delivering  bread in a situation where he was a very easy target.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The fact that such individuals spent 10, 15 or 20 years  protecting this community means that they should have been given the highest  possible level of recognition and treatment. It is extremely regrettable that,  as a result of an administrative mistake, tax and national insurance has been  deducted from the gratuity that they so richly deserved. No one can put a  monetary value on the work that those men and women have done for the Province.  The type of payments that we are talking about is simply a token recognition of  their value to society and what they have done for the ordinary, decent  citizen. However, having achieved that gratuity as a direct result of my  party&rsquo;s negotiations, they have been shabbily treated by having large amounts  deducted through tax and National Insurance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When it comes to the issue of how those cheques were posted  out, heads should roll. Frankly, it is absolutely inexcusable that whoever was  responsible for putting those cheques into those envelopes left themselves in  the position whereby they left individual former members of the part-time  Reserve immediately identifiable.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will give you an example. When my credit card comes  through the post, the company concerned takes precautions as follows: it is in  a plain white envelope, the address is handwritten and there is a postage stamp  on it. Why is that done? So that no one handling that item of correspondence could  identify it as my credit card. By the way, my credit card is, frankly, hardly  worth having, but still. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> The postman  would be wasting his time if he opened my envelope. However, the company concerned  is taking sensible precautions to ensure that it is not identified as my credit  card coming to my address.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">What were the people thinking when they decided to send out  that cheque in an envelope that clearly identified the person as a former member  of the part-time Reserve? I just cannot understand how such a basic mistake was  made, and I hope that, when the inquiry is concluded, those who made absolutely  fundamental mistakes will be disciplined and the person responsible will be  removed from post. This is not rocket science. Did nobody sit down for one  moment and say, &ldquo;Hold on a minute; does that not identify who we are sending  the envelopes to?&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I know that the vast majority of postmen and those who sort  mail in Northern Ireland are honourable, upright people and, in many areas,  including large areas of south Down, I am completely confident that the people  who handle and deliver the mail in no way use the information that was so  readily obtainable to identify, target and pass on information to sinister  elements that Mr Smith or Mr Jones is a former part-time member of the RUC  Reserve. However, the reality is that there are still one or two individuals  out there who could make use of that information, and, if one former member of  the part-time RUC Reserve&rsquo;s security has been placed at risk as a result of  this mistake, I see that as a very serious lack of attention to detail and  thoughtfulness. I was flabbergasted to open my newspaper, discover this story  and start to receive complaints from individuals. I could not believe that it  had happened, because it is not the first time. There have been numerous  previous examples, and it is absolutely unforgivable.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Irwin</strong>: I  welcome the opportunity to comment on the debate today and, like many other  representatives in the room, I have directly assisted many constituents in  applying for this payment. The considerable blunder by the Department of  Justice in using entirely the wrong sort of envelope and not taking the very  simple step of looking at the envelope to ensure that it was not possible to  see what the letter is about is, of course, totally unacceptable.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This matter has caused concern to many people, and, indeed,  a similar blunder was made by the Service Personnel and Veterans Agency in  their war pensions payments only last year. That blunder affected many  ex-security force members in Northern    Ireland. Indeed, a number of people in my  constituency felt let down by the Government over that situation. It is  completely unacceptable to have a situation whereby government, while trying to  be of service to people, actually do them a disservice. Many ex-members and  their families are, rightly, very security-conscious, given the renewed  terrorist threat from dissident republicans. Therefore, for those letters to be  sent out with the content clearly visible was and continues to be a huge issue  for them, and one can fully understand their concern.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The apology from the Justice Minister was inadequate and,  given the very serious ramifications of the security breach, the Minister needs  to explain in detail what went wrong. Who made the decision to use windowed  envelopes, and why did no one feel the need to check them to ensure that the  recipient&rsquo;s security was not unnecessarily undermined? Security surely must be  one of the key parts of any Department, none more so than the Department of  Justice.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will move to the issue of the taxation of the payments.  That is extremely infuriating as, again, it smacks of government giving with  one hand and taking away with the other. A gratuity payment, by its very  nature, should be offered in full, and no more so than when we consider the  great sacrifice made by members of the RUC and their families throughout the  Troubles.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Government&rsquo;s decision to tax that payment was  unfortunate. Coupled with the security breach, it has left a bitter taste.  However, I have spoken to those who received the payment, and they are grateful  for the sum. I know that many others, despite the difficulties, genuinely  appreciate those, including senior members in my party, who worked hard to make  that gratuity payment special scheme a reality. I await with interest the  response of Justice Minister David Ford and I thank the Members who tabled the  motion.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Copeland</strong>:  In addressing this issue, I seek to give offence to no one and to tread  carefully. However, it is important that we understand that the men and women  of the Royal Ulster Constabulary Reserve and their colleagues in the police  force, the Ulster Defence Regiment and the regular army were among those who,  in the darkest days of this Province, put themselves in harm&rsquo;s way. Now they  find that an amount of money, which is not large, is given to them, with tax  and National Insurance deducted from it. It is delivered to them in an envelope  that identifies their place of residence and their former service.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is hard to understand the impact of that unless, like  some in the Chamber, you lived through it. Even to this day, turning the  ignition of your car and the engine firing without the bonnet exploding brings  a sigh of relief. To this day, it is hard to understand not letting more than  one person into your car before it bumps down the kerb that separates the  pavement from the road, so that, if a mercury tilt switch is under the bonnet,  only one person will be injured, or the inability to hang work shirts on the  line in case the neighbours see it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">All of that is not a symbol of grumpy men and women with a  history of service approaching middle age. It is not a symbol of their living  in the past but of the past living in them, because what a section of this  society went through and was put through cannot be adequately quantified in  words or represented and offset by money.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is unfair to blame Minister Ford individually, although  his colleague&rsquo;s notion of ministerial responsibility is, perhaps, somewhat  skewed. However, someone somewhere took a decision that brought back a  nightmare for a large number of people. I had three people in my office who all  expressed concerns, one of whom was identified when the forms were first sent  out because the envelope delivered through the post had been tampered with.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I cannot begin to try to explain to those who did not live  through that how the impact of events in the past impinges on the present. I  know what it is like to get a telephone call from the guardroom in Hastings Street  police station that begins, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s been a shooting&rdquo;. The thumping heart, the  dryness, the shaking, the drive to try to find out where to go to find out the  truth and the relief when &mdash; thank God, in my case &mdash; it was not serious. No one  can understand the way that comes back. In one case, which I can speak of  because it was very close to me, it resurfaced 31 years after the event, with a  thrashing in the bed and the quoting of courtesy as an essential quality and  one that will smooth many a path; instantly known to anyone here as one of the  definitions of being a constable in the Royal Ulster Constabulary.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Whoever made this mistake, Minister, with no vindictiveness  speak to them and make sure, please, that it does not happen again. I support  the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I suppose that because of our unhappy history and divided political loyalties,  it is difficult for somebody like me to share the view expressed about the RUC  and the RUC Reserve. Nonetheless, I have to recognise the fact, as do other  Members, that members of the RUC Reserve were cruelly targeted because they  were soft targets. They were targeted by the IRA in a murder campaign against  them. Therefore, it should be recognised that those men and women gave to this  society and that they suffered. We should all regret and be ashamed of that  suffering. It is wrong that those people were targeted, attacked and, in some  instances, murdered because they carried out civilian jobs and were accessible,  contactable and targetable.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Special recognition is rightly given to those people. As an  outworking of the Patten reforms, it is right and proper that a gratuity should  be given, and that gratuity has been given. However, it seems rather shabby  that the Government should give a gratuity and then say that it should be taxed  and have National Insurance contributions deducted. I thought that a gratuity  was a gratuity. If &pound;20 million was given as a global figure for a gratuity, it  should have been &pound;20 million, not &pound;20 million minus 40% or whatever percentage  it might be. Members of the Reserve can, quite rightly, say that they have been  shabbily treated. It seems grossly unfair and insensitive to tax that gratuity.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Their situation is worsened by the incompetence of the  Department in sending out envelopes that were clearly identifiable and exposed  people, although perhaps not to the extent that some Members have suggested  today, to a risk that they should not have been exposed to. I take the point  that Mr Copeland made that it has brought back memories to people who served in  the Reserve, and that is particularly regrettable. It was not simply  incompetence; it was negligence, and it should be marked as such. It was inexcusable.  The Department should, rightly, be criticised for the way in which it carried  out the exercise.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The taxation issue should have been anticipated by the NIO,  the Police Federation or whoever. It should not have taken people by surprise.  When the Treasury gets its teeth into something, it does not let go. People  should reflect on the way in which the exercise was conducted and the  regrettable aspects. The SDLP supports the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D McIlveen</strong>:  I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in the debate. I fully support the  motion. I feel that it is another let-down in a long list that the part-time  Reserve folk have had to endure. I feel that they have been treated abysmally.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I begin by acknowledging the debt that we owe those people.  They are true local heroes. In my view, their treatment to date has been  something of a let-down. I believe that we need to redress that balance  immediately. I have been lobbied by a number of former part-time Reserve  officers. One lady, who wishes to remain anonymous, wrote to me. I want to read  a couple of words of what she wrote. She said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The payment is made in recognition of the particular  circumstances of those who volunteered to serve the Police Part-Time Reserve,  making themselves vulnerable within the community for the safety of others,  with the accompanying risks and the demonstration of civic spirit which that  volunteering exhibited.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The money owed should be a reflection of the exceptional  sacrifices that those people have made for us. That has evidently not been the  case. Tax and National Insurance have been taken out of the gratuity payments,  and I agree that it is totally unacceptable that the gratuity package has been  taxed. The only winner in this scenario is the Treasury. It seems that this is  an entirely wrong way in which to thank members of the part-time Reserve for  the service that they have given to Ulster.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">They have been let down by the security breach by the  Department of Justice. I believe that the Minister must take responsibility for  that in some capacity. I acknowledge that the Minister has established a  helpline, initiated an urgent security assessment and instigated a review on  how it happened. However, I call for much stronger action to be taken. The  Minister ought to know exactly who is responsible for the incident and take the  relevant action as a matter of urgency. The people affected and the general  public must know that something on this scale will not go unnoticed and  unpunished. I propose that the official in question be dealt with immediately  to reassure us all that the Department is truly conscious of the gravity of the  matter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Anyone who came into contact with the envelopes in question  now knows that someone at that address has connections with the RUC Reserve.  Has the Minister considered reintroducing the special purchase of evacuated  dwellings (SPED) scheme for those people? Is there provision and adequate  reserves in his budget to ensure that if the lives of the people affected are  brought under risk as a result of the blunder, they can be rehomed and assured  that their safety is taken care of? It was a colossal error, and I believe that  it must be dealt with as quickly as possible and taken as seriously as  possible.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To sum up, I will talk about the people who have been let  down. Fifty-three part-time officers died as a result of terrorist activity; 13  former part-time officers were murdered; and a further six died as a result of  road traffic accidents or terrorist incidents when they were off duty. That is  a total of 72. Those murdered on duty represent one in six of the losses of the  RUC, and those who were murdered after they left the force represent over half  the losses. Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government do not hold any record of the number of  part-time officers who were intimidated from their civilian employment or from  their service with the RUC, but we can assume that there were many. From 1970  to 2004, 59 are recorded as having been medically retired as a result of injury  on duty. One would assume that, having been retired through injury on duty, the  officer would immediately qualify for the award of a police pension. A specific  ruling was available under the RUC code.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Who let those heroes down? That is what we have to ask. Who  dropped the ball in the Department of Justice that brought about this blunder?  I ask the Minister to address those issues. I support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I want to make a few comments. I commend the movers of the motion for bringing  it to the House and those who secured the &pound;20 million way back during the  Hillsborough talks. There was no doubt whatsoever that it was intended that the  money, in its entirety, would go to the officers and that it would not be  subjected to the rigours of the taxman. However, we have discovered that the  taxman is definitely always waiting.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have also been reassured today by Mr Dickson in  particular that the Minister&rsquo;s hands are perfectly clean and that he has played  a clean part in the events. I will take him at his word. However, the Minister  could do something about a matter that, up until now, he has been emphatic that  he will not do, but I would like to hear him use a different tone here today.  Some people missed the opportunity to put in a claim, for real and legitimate  reasons.<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I ask the Minister, in the cold light of day  following this debate, whether he is prepared to reconsider his position. I  know the position that he has taken. Would he be prepared, in light of what has  been and what will be said, to reconsider his position and give due  consideration to those who genuinely missed putting in their application? I am  aware of some &mdash; not many &mdash; who were left out and should be included.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I understand that approximately 6,000 members will get a  distribution of &pound;20 million, which, at a quick calculation, is about &pound;3,500  each, less tax. That is hardly a large sum of money by anybody&rsquo;s standards.  However, it took the taste out of it when the Government stepped in and said  that they would have their clawback and their share of all the endeavours that  those people had done over the years. Let it be said that the RUC Reserve and  the RUC stood between sanity and insanity in this country and that there are  many people alive today who would not be but for their endeavours and efforts.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I think that Mr McCartney&rsquo;s comments were in very bad  taste. Here is a party that tells us that it is concerned about human rights  and rights generally, whether they agree or disagree with them. However, they  could not extend that concern today to the RUC Reserve GC. That is in sharp  contrast to the SDLP&rsquo;s attitude. It took a constructive approach to the whole  thing and said that it was prepared to support the sentiments expressed in the  motion and would not seek to divide the House. I welcome that.</p>
    <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Beggs] in the Chair)</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The real challenge for the Minister is to look again at the  situation, give some reassurance to those who have not benefited and look at  the extent to which the taxman will have a go at those who will. Because of the  discrepancies and errors that have been made, the House should give that due  consideration today and send out a forceful message, united as one voice,  recognising that this award is most deserving. This is a gratuity payment. This  is recognition of work and deeds done on behalf of this country and all its citizens,  even those who did not agree with the RUC Reserve. The SDLP has been generous  enough to acknowledge that in its Members&rsquo; comments this afternoon. If this  House sent out a united voice, the Minister and government in general should  reconsider their position.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister may not be able to do that, as Mr Dickson has  said. His hands may be tied in relation to what the taxman has or has not done.  However, there are some things about which his hands are not tied. He should  acknowledge that, bring those things to the House today and say that he is  prepared to give due consideration again, in particular, to those who missed  out on the application.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  There are few sections of our society to whom we owe more than the police  reservists, many of whom paid with their life for daring to defend law and  order. I think today of the first member of the security forces killed in  Ballymena, Mr Lamont, a reservist. I think of other gallant men, such as Eric  Lutton, butchered by wicked, evil terrorists. I then think of the survivors who  gave so many years service and who get treated in the manner that they have  been, in the nature, the extent and the administration of this gratuity.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For me, there are three issues: the appalling taxation  issue; the appalling administration, which missed a third of potential  applicants; and the appalling security breach. I will deal with them in that  order. This was a negotiation that the DUP likes to claim much credit for. If  it claims credit for it, it must equally accept that it botched it. The offer  of &pound;20 million was made in a letter to Peter Robinson in October 2009 in the  run-up to the Hillsborough negotiations, where, it tells us, it had all sorts  of leverage. It took its eyes right off the ball, and, instead of checking, double-checking  and making absolutely sure that, like the previous gratuity for the UDR, this  was going to be tax-free, it never bothered. If it did bother, it accepted that  the gratuity would be taxed, such was its urgency to do the nefarious deal that  it did with the former IRA party, Sinn F&eacute;in.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">So, that was a negotiation botched. If the political  leverage that was there had been applied, we would not be talking about the  taxation. That should be an embarrassment to every politician. Effectively, any  Member of this House, the House of Commons or the European Parliament who quits  their office or is not returned gets a gratuity, of which the first &pound;30,000 is  tax-free. Yet here we have men who sacrificed beyond description. One of them  spoke to me last week. He had served for over 30 years, but he got a cheque for  less than &pound;5,000, which is &pound;3 a week.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Then we find that an inflexible, rigid, uncaring, unfeeling  arrangement for the application meant that only two thirds of those who were  eligible ever got the money. Although I commend the Member for moving the  motion, I regret that he did not include this portion. It speaks for itself. If  only 66% of those eligible applied, there was something drastically wrong with  the advertising process that drew it to the public&rsquo;s attention. No one has to  elaborate on that point, yet there has been a rigid refusal to deal with it. On  that, I condemn the Minister for his inflexibility. He was more than happy to  see deadlines pass, time after time, when it came to decommissioning, but he  sticks rigidly to a deadline that shuts out those who sacrificed in the police  Reserve.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I condemn the Minister for that, and I condemn him and his  Department for the incredibly shambolic arrangements that gave rise to the  security risk that has been posed to so many. The Minister tells us that his  departmental officials told him that they could not write out to everyone who  they thought might have been in the Reserve, even though they held their  addresses, because there was a security risk. However, they can send out  cheques and letters that compound that security risk. The manner in which this  thing has been treated is quite appalling, and the Department has much to  answer for.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to draw his remarks to a close, please.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  In passing the motion, we do not just pass it: we look for action from the  Department, and I look for those who have been closed out to be given their  share of the money yet.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  speak towards the end of the debate. Unlike other Members, I do not have the  police connections or any degree of personal connection, save that I grew up  through the Troubles. I grew up in an area that, although not untouched by the  Troubles, was largely regarded as one of the safer areas in Northern Ireland.  I owe my opportunity to live a relatively peaceful life throughout most of that  time to the bravery of the security forces: the UDR, the RUC, the British Army  and the reservists. From that point of view, I commend the motion, because that  recognition has been long overdue. Some of those brave men and women paid the  supreme sacrifice through their actions, but all of them sacrificed through  their families. As a result of their sacrifices, I was able to sleep safely in  my bed at night. They held the line against terrorism for many years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is one element in what Mr Allister said that I can  perhaps agree with: there are three issues to this. First, it is right that we  acknowledge that it is worthwhile that at least there has been some  recognition, albeit belated. For many years, the issue was ignored. Despite  high levels of lobbying, successive Ministers simply turned a blind eye to it,  but, through the work of reservists and through the position that was agreed at  Hillsborough, we finally got some level of recognition.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will turn to the imperfect elements of the issue in a  moment, but at least something was achieved. Therefore, I take grave exception  to Members who in no circumstances would have given a penny to the reservists  and to the criticism from the Member who spoke previously. This recognition  occurred only because of the negotiations that took place at Hillsborough. The  Member who spoke previously berates this party, but, if we had followed his  advice, we would not be talking about &pound;20 million; there would not be one penny  for the reservists. There would not be a single bit of recognition, so I will  not take any lectures from the Member opposite.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  You took your eye off the ball.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to address his remarks through the Chair.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: We  are accused of taking our eye off the ball, but the reality is that the Member  was not even on the field to look at the ball, let alone do anything of that  nature. There are two main issues that I support. I welcome the motion that has  been proposed and the support and indication of the more mature attitude that  has come from the SDLP today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As has been indicated, there has been a major breach of  security, and I believe that it was entirely foreseeable. Mr Copeland talked  about the memories of the past being dragged up for many reservists. However,  it is not just the memories of the past but the fear of the future, namely that  somehow the information could get into the hands of dissidents and, yet again,  make people vulnerable.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although I am sure that the Minister will tell us of the  steps that he has taken, there must be people in the Department who are  directly culpable for this gross negligence. I am not normally someone who  seeks his pound of flesh, but I would like to hear from the Minister not simply  apologies or announcements of investigations but about actions against those  individuals to make them culpable for the appalling mess that they have  created.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, there is the issue of the taxation of the  gratuity, which is clearly not what was agreed. At times, the Prime Minister  tells us that he is a man who cherishes the Union and that the Conservative  Party apparently cherishes the Union. Talk is  all very well, but here is a distinct opportunity for them to give some measure  of equality to those brave men and women of Northern Ireland who stood on the  front line. Even at this late hour, I call on Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government, through  the Treasury, to reverse that decision and ensure that the money that has  managed to be secured for those people is tax-free, that the National Insurance  is not deducted and that the Treasury&rsquo;s penny-pinching attitude is reversed. I  commend the motion to the House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford (The  Minister of Justice)</strong>: First, I congratulate Mr Hussey and his colleagues on  securing the debate, which provides me with the opportunity to set out the  steps that have been taken to address the difficulties that have arisen with  the scheme recently. It is a matter of real regret that the conclusion of the  gratuity scheme was marred by the unhappy circumstances surrounding the issuing  of letters to recipients. I and all those involved in the running of the scheme  have been upset by the potential compromise of individuals&rsquo; identities as  serving or former reservists, and I recognise the anxiety suffered by  individuals who have been in touch with the Department since receiving their  letters. Therefore, let me reiterate the apology that I have already made to  those affected.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am also pleased to be able to use this opportunity, as  many others have during the debate, to underline the importance of recognising  the service of the part-time Reserve. There have been difficulties with the  administration of the scheme at its closing stages. There have also been  disagreements about the terms of the scheme, which was passed to me by the  Minister of State in the Northern Ireland Office, but there has effectively  been no disagreement about the service that the part-time Reserve has given,  the risks that reservists faced or the sacrifices that they made, including the  72 people, who, as has been said, made the ultimate sacrifice. They faced a  disproportionate risk because they continued to live and work in the  communities they served as part-time officers. Jim Wells, in particular, gave a  very graphic example of that.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Receiving a payment from the scheme is not intended to be  in itself the measure of the community&rsquo;s appreciation of an officer&rsquo;s service.  It would be easy in those circumstances to feel that the sum was derisory. Even  though the payments were graduated and given a monetary value, it was never the  intention that they should equate to a certain number of days&rsquo; or weeks&rsquo; work.  That sort of example has been unhelpful this afternoon. Rather, in setting  aside the substantial sum of money to make ex gratia payments to these  officers, it is intended that the part-time Reserve is given some meaningful  recognition of the service that it has provided.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Discussion during the debate centred on the two main issues  of tax and National Insurance and the security breach. Let me deal with some of  the points that individuals made. It was always the case that the scheme, when  it was presented to the Department of Justice, mentioned the payment of tax and  National Insurance and that standard rules had to be applied by HMRC. In that  sense, it has been suggested that administrative mistakes were made in the  Department of Justice. They were not. The rules that were laid down by HMRC  were imposed. It had been suggested that no effort was made to change that.  Having personally written to the Chancellor after officials had failed with the  Treasury and having then spoken to the Chancellor on a visit to Northern  Ireland and made the case, I do not accept that anything more could have been  done by the Department of Justice to deal with the case that was presented to  it on devolution by the Northern Ireland Office.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: I  am confused. The UDR payments came without any tax or National Insurance  liability. As Mr Allister mentioned, someone who leaves their employment can  take a gratuity of up to &pound;30,000 with no tax or National Insurance deducted.  The vast majority of these payments &mdash; perhaps all of them &mdash; were less than  &pound;30,000. Why could they not have been treated in a similar way to payments to  any normal employee?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  am no expert in tax law to advise Mr Wells in that respect. My understanding of  the analogy of the &pound;30,000 is that it is effectively dealt with as one of the  redundancy payments when there is an allowance that is not taxable.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Anderson</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>:  Give me a second to finish this point.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The specific points were explored, and we were told that  there was no alternative but to have tax and National Insurance payments  deducted. I am not aware of the precise circumstances of the payment to the  Ulster Defence Regiment. I am aware that officials went through great detail  with HMRC, I then followed up with the Chancellor, and we got no alternative to  the rules requiring tax and insurance applying to payments made from the &pound;20  million.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Anderson</strong>:  I thank the Minister for giving way. Did the Department in fact seek advice  from tax experts on how the scheme should be taxed?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>:  Yes, of course we sought advice. Indeed, there was ongoing discussion with  HMRC, which was then followed up politically by me with the Chancellor, to seek  to deal with the issue in a way that would meet the concerns of reservists who  felt that they were not getting a fair deal. The reality was that we tried  everything that we could, but we were unable to get the Treasury to change its  collective mind. Therefore, the only option we had was to work within the  guidelines that were laid down.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It may well be shabby. That word resonated around the  Chamber this afternoon, when Mr Maginness described the behaviour of the  Treasury as such. That does not alter the fact that it is applying the law as  it applies to tax, and the Department of Justice had no alternative but to  follow that. Regardless of whether or not Members want that to have happened  and whether or not Members are baffled by it, that is the reality. Considerable  effort was put into dealing with the issue, and it was unsuccessful because of  an unwillingness on the part of the Chancellor to go beyond the &pound;20 million as  the overall gross payment subject to tax and National Insurance.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hussey</strong>:  Will the Minister advise the House whether he asked the Chancellor if he would  be prepared to treat this as an exceptional payment? The Chancellor would have  had the authority, as I am sure the Minister is aware, to create this as an  exceptional payment. He has, in the past, acted as other Chancellors have  acted. Was the Chancellor specifically asked to treat this as an exceptional  payment?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  am not sure of the precise term; Mr Hussey refers to &ldquo;exceptional payment&rdquo;. I  made very clear to the Chancellor, both in writing and in personal  representation, the feeling of annoyance that was being created; the  comparisons that were being made, particularly with the Ulster Defence Regiment  gratuity; and the strong feeling that there would be a considerable benefit  were he to increase the amount payable in order that tax could be paid. He took  no notice of those representations.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hussey</strong>:  Will the Minister give way again?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>:  Very briefly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hussey</strong>: I  will be very brief. The Chancellor could have treated that as an exceptional  payment. You are, of course, aware of the exceptional circumstances that  applied to the Northern Ireland Civil Service and the Royal Irish Regiment,  whereby the employers paid the tax and National Insurance and actually did a  deal with Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs. I am sure that they did not pay  the full tax and National Insurance, but they paid an amount towards it and  made a deal. That issue was raised with your Department. Where did we go with  that negotiation?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  am sorry, but my understanding is that tax and National Insurance were paid at  the full rate. I know that comparisons are being made about the percentage that  was deducted. One of the difficulties is that, because of the way in which the  payment was made, a large number of people had 40% tax deducted from their  payment, but they have been given a form to reclaim that. Unfortunately, there  was no other way to deal with that. The most helpful thing that could be done  was to advise people on making the claim.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  am sorry; I have been giving way for a considerable period and have other  issues that I wish to cover.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Of more concern than the tax and National Insurance issue  is the security issue. From the very beginning, Mr Hussey said that there  should have been full confidential cover in the way in which those  communications were sent out. Clearly, that should have been the case. However,  a number of Members, starting with Mr Anderson, made references to blunders by  officials from the Department of Justice. In defence of those who work for me  in the Department, I want to make it clear that no official from the Department  of Justice was responsible for putting letters into envelopes, windowed or  otherwise. The matter was dealt with by the Police Fund, which has, as the name  suggests, significant links to the police and which one would expect to be &mdash; it  normally is &mdash; fully cognisant of security issues. It was acting as an agent for  the Department, and, in that respect, I accept responsibility for what was  done. However, those who wish to criticise really would do better than to  criticise the generality of civil servants in the Department of Justice, who were  not responsible for that issue. Clearly, there was a very significant  administrative blunder that caused considerable concern, but that blunder was  not made by the Department. What we now need to do is to seek to address it. I  take entirely Conall McDevitt&rsquo;s point that the duty of care means that an  apology is not enough. We need to see how we are addressing that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let me return briefly to some of the other points about the  issues of take-up and tax, particularly those made by Lord Morrow and Mr  Allister. The estimate I was given was that there would be in the region of  7,400 potential applicants: those who had served, had not been dismissed for  misconduct and had not passed away. In practice, we got 6,200 applications.  That is not, therefore, 66% but something more equating to 84%, and it is, in fact,  more than double the number estimated by the part-time Reserve welfare group. I  believe that that was a fairly reasonable take-up. Issues were raised about the  security of writing out to people, which clearly created some difficulties.  However, we had to split the &pound;20 million among the eligible applicants, based  loosely on their length of service, so there had to be a cut-off date for  applications. Therefore, the suggestion that we should have kept the scheme  open for ever simply was not possible. That is why I do not believe that the  suggestions made by Lord Morrow and Mr Allister are possible. There had to be a  date on which applications for the scheme closed. Indeed, extensions were  granted to allow people to get their application in order, but there had to be  a cut-off date to ensure that we got the details right.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>:  Very briefly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  On the point about the figure of 9,400, I hold in my hand a letter from an  official from the Department of Justice that says that the figure was 9,400 and  that the percentage of applicants was 66%. On the point that you had a set  figure of &pound;20 million to be divided among the number of applicants, you charged  40% tax, and there is now going to be a refund to many members. Where is that  refunded money going? Why can it not be used for those who have missed out thus  far?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>:  Those from whom 40% tax was deducted and who were liable to pay only 20% or,  indeed, no tax, would expect to get the refund to which they are entitled.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister and the Department made the arrangements,  which may or may not be regarded as shambolic. Mr Allister may wish to raise  issues with the DUP about the negotiation of those arrangements, in which I had  no part. I want to address the key issue, which Ross Hussey started with and  others raised, about the actions that have been taken by the Department.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In response to the reported security breach, I instituted a  number of immediate actions on Monday 22 August 2011. I am happy to give  details to the Assembly. First, I sought an urgent assessment of the security  implications of the breach and made it clear that, if that required action for  any individual, as well as the general assessment, that action would be taken.  The Department set up a phone line that was in operation that morning for  recipients of gratuity letters who had concerns about their security. The  Department is responding directly to those individuals and to others who have  written to or e-mailed it. There were also complaints that the Police Fund was  unable to respond to all the queries that it received; therefore the Department  sent staff to assist the Police Fund in dealing with the work that has been  created there. That has included, for example, issues such as the backlog in  dealing with phone messages and issues that arose when, due to banking  problems, payments were not made correctly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As to the security threat, we have advised that anyone who  believes that they are under specific threat should contact their area  commander. I have also initiated an investigation into the breach of normal  practice in respect of the security of those 6,000 individuals. I want to  understand the decisions that led to that outcome and how those decisions were  reached.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To date, 156 people have called the telephone helpline;  nine have e-mailed; and nine have written to the Department. On Tuesday 6  September 2011, the Department wrote to all those who had contacted it in order  to explain progress in the security assessment. Mr McIlveen mentioned the SPED  scheme, which is open to anyone who has security concerns that are  substantiated by the Police Service. The vast majority of those 156 people  raised concerns that related to issues in the past. Relatively few have raised  concerns about issues of today. I appreciate fully that that does not lessen  the anxiety of some of those reservists, which many Members expressed in the  debate. Their anxiety needs to be taken into account. We need to do what we can  to reassure those reservists because, however small that proportion is, it is  creating difficulty for them. We will seek to continue that work to support  those who feel particular difficulties and ensure that a proper individual  assessment is carried out by the Police Service. If measures such as SPED are  appropriate, they will be taken.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The investigation that I initiated on 22 August is nearing  completion. I have had a preliminary briefing from the departmental security  officer. I want to offer reassurance that the Police Fund recognises the need  for appropriate security measures. Members have called for action to be taken  against those whom they see as responsible. However, I trust that no Member  would expect action to be taken without the due process that is being followed  through seriously. Let me reiterate that, just as others have paid tribute to  those who served in the part-time Reserve, it is important that we as a House  commend them collectively for the circumstances in which they stepped up to  protect the community.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I am privileged to make the winding-up speech. I pay tribute to my colleague Mr  Ross Hussey, who was instrumental in bringing the debate before the House. I  also acknowledge &mdash; I hope that it is in order &mdash; that others, some of whom are  present in the Gallery and some, no doubt, listening to the debate on the  internet, will have profound interest in the issue. I pay tribute to them, too,  for their sterling service. I hope that at least some comments that have been  made in the Chamber will have been to their satisfaction.<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many Members spoke eloquently about the contribution of the  part-time Reserve. By their very nature, they lived in the community, often in  dangerous situations. As Mr Hussey said, many of those, some of whom were  murdered, did so after they resigned. That brings into perspective the  disproportionate nature of the penalty that those brave men and women suffered  for trying to do what they thought was right for all of us.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Sydney Anderson mentioned the fact that Mr Hussey had been  involved in this. I also note that David McIlveen quoted his statistics from a  paper that was prepared by Mr Hussey and his colleagues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When is a gratuity not a gratuity? The answer is of course:  when you take 40% of it away. Society has to decide whether to put the past  behind us and deal with those issues properly. If so, being mean about a  situation absolutely undermines the intent behind what you are trying to do. If  you give money to people, you should not take it back. Several Members raised  that point.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The challenge was thrown down by Mr Weir about calling on  the Government to deal with this issue, and I support that. I hope &mdash; no doubt  there will be a few comments about this &mdash; that his party&rsquo;s MPs will bring up  the issue at Westminster  too. This is something that we can deal with collectively.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The next issue is the security breach. One of the  Minister&rsquo;s endearing attributes is that he is mildly spoken and brings calm to  these issues sometimes; however, had this happened five, 10 or 15 years ago,  the palpable sense of outrage and complete disbelief that we could send out  papers identifying part-time RUC reservists would have brought the Government  down. It is a serious issue. Although the Minister said that he would look at  this, I do not think that we have yet found a way of addressing it. Make no  mistake: it shakes the very foundation of what we are trying to do that we  cannot find a way of delivering the post to those who have served us so loyally  in the past. We have to address that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If he gives me latitude, I will mention Mr Copeland, who  started his address by saying that he wanted to give no offence. I will try to  give no offence on this issue, but there are a few points that need to be said  in an appropriate way for the record. Mr Copeland graphically described the  difficulties facing people. It brought home to those of us who were not in the  RUC or the part-time Reserve, as Mr Weir acknowledged, just what it was like to  live under those conditions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will note, without the histrionics of some others, that  when we claim victory for a negotiation it is disappointing if we do not quite  get the outcome that we want. Therefore, rather than taking any particular  blame or pointing fingers, we must all try to avoid making a mistake and see if  we can get restitution.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I repeat that I expect to see a concerted effort from the  colleagues to my left to see whether we can address the injustice of the  gratuity being taxed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I saw Members from Sinn F&eacute;in shaking their heads at some of  the things that I said, and I am disappointed by their approach. In recent days  and weeks, I heard the attack that Members of that party launched against the  Police Ombudsman, telling him about the things that were not done correctly.  They questioned how we are to move forward if we cannot deal with the past and  why we cannot deal with the issues. I also note that party&rsquo;s recent ard fheis,  which was an interesting exercise in people talking about moving forward. Those  of my colleagues who are not content with the motion are missing an  opportunity. If they are serious about moving forward, we must find a way of  dealing with the past. Simply demonising those who carried out a reasonable and  proper defence of the people who they believed they were serving, does no one  any justice.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hussey</strong>:  My colleague referred to those who demonise those who served in the Royal  Ulster Constabulary. Colleagues of mine are here today, one of whom was present  at the Enniskillen bomb and who still has a blood-stained uniform in his  wardrobe. That memory will haunt him for the rest of his days. As an  18-year-old part-time police officer, I saw the body of a colleague and that  picture will be in my head until the day that I die. There is a lady here  today, who, as a part-time police officer, continually had to go the homes of  murdered officers and stay with their wives while the bodies were attended to.  Those nightmares are always there, and, in some of the cases that I referred  to, flashbacks are coming back to those concerned because some idiot could not  put a letter into a plain brown envelope and post it out. An idiot did that,  and someone&rsquo;s head should roll. There are people here today who suffer from  nightmares because of that incompetence.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I thank Mr Hussey for his intervention and for putting his point more  eloquently than I could.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I move to the conclusion of my contribution, I quote the  Minister&rsquo;s own words back to him: &ldquo;an apology is not enough&rdquo;. We need to find a  way of addressing that issue. The issue of whether the Chancellor or the NIO  was responsible for the decision to tax the gratuity is water under the bridge.  What matters now is how we try to address this issue. The Minister said that  the Department of Justice was not responsible for the security breach, but  someone was responsible, and people should stand up and take responsibility for  their actions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, my mother&rsquo;s father was in the RUC, and, all  of my life, I have taken pride in the actions of its part-time and full-time  members. I commend them, and I commend the motion to the House. I hope that it  will be agreed unanimously.</p>

    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="9"></a>Adjournment</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Belfast City Hospital: Closure of Accident and  Emergency Unit</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind Members that the proposer of the topic for debate will  have 15 minutes. The Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety will  have 10 minutes to respond. All other Members who wish to speak will have  approximately seven minutes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  The House will be glad to hear that I do not intend to take my 15 minutes.  However, I do not believe that the provision is there for me to allow anyone  else to use it up.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Belfast City Hospital has served the community of Belfast  city for some considerable time. Its accident and emergency unit has been an  integral part of the fabric of the south inner city and university districts as  well as many of the suburban areas in the greater south Belfast area. It has  provided service in an impartial and fair way, and is seen as a local hospital  to that particular community.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We live in an era in which we all must be attentive to the  need to deliver a better type of health service and in which we must ensure  that it is delivered to better standards than would, historically, have been  the case. I do not think that anyone would really argue with that point.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, what has caused so many people in South Belfast to  be very concerned is the manner in which events unfolded over the summer. We  first heard that the Department was thinking about launching a consultation  about the possible future of A&amp;E services at Belfast City Hospital, a piece  of news that came as a surprise owing to its timing. Why? Simply because it has  always been understood that any future change to A&amp;E services across the  city of Belfast would occur only when the critical care facility came online at  the Royal Victoria Hospital. The Minister rightly reminds us that that facility  is still some considerable way off completion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Last week, matters took a considerable turn for the worse,  with a decision taken on, we are told, clinical grounds by the Belfast Health  and Social Care Trust to close A&amp;E services as of 1 November because, in  its words, it cannot guarantee adequate clinical cover to ensure that services  continue to the standards acceptable to modern regulatory codes. That decision  begs a question, and some of the debate unfolded following the Minister&rsquo;s  statement in the House earlier: how come a crisis emerged when we have known  about the problem for so long? How come we have had a decision foisted on us on  clinical grounds when the problem has been known about for so long?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The big issue that people have with this series of events is  that no one is trying to say that things will be better after 1 November. What  we do know for a fact is that there will be fewer A&amp;E beds in Belfast city  on 1 November than there are today. We also know for a fact that the facilities  at the Royal Victoria Hospital are temporary and that, to try to mitigate the  impact of the closure at the City Hospital, more temporary facilities will be  added to the Royal. When winter really digs in, and the inevitable occurs &mdash;  seasonal flu, winter vomiting and other unavoidable winter illnesses &mdash; where  will the capacity come from to accommodate them? The only thing that we know  about all this is that the capacity will not be there.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is my view, and possibly that of many of us who  represent South Belfast, irrespective of party allegiance, that the decision  was entirely premature &mdash; it was made before its time &mdash; and that the crisis  decision taken by the trust on clinical grounds was entirely foreseeable. The  Minister must, therefore, commit to trying to restore proper clinical standards  at Belfast City Hospital A&amp;E as a matter of urgency, and he must guarantee  the House and the people of our city that no significant or policy decisions  will be taken about the future of A&amp;E until such a time as the critical  care facility comes online at the Royal Victoria Hospital, because anything  short of that will inevitably lead to fewer resources being available to meet  the needs of the city.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am aware of the points that the Minister makes about the  recruitment of doctors.<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I have sympathy for those professionals at trust  level who are struggling to meet that need. However, forgive me a moment of  cynicism: it is an exceptionally convenient turn of events that several weeks  after the Minister told us that he was minded to do something, the clinical  need to do it emerges. Once the clinical need is there, the event happens. The  cynics will ask what chance is there that the Minister&rsquo;s proposed consultation  will be able to be conducted in a free, unfettered and objective way.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Before it all becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, my call,  and that of the SDLP in south Belfast, is that we step back from allowing the  inevitable to happen and look at ensuring that the facilities that are at  Belfast City Hospital A&amp;E are properly staffed and resourced until such  time as the Royal Victoria Hospital is able to absorb the extra capacity that  will arise.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>:  I, too, will not take too long. I thank my colleague from South Belfast Conall  McDevitt for securing this Adjournment debate. It comes after the Minister made  a fairly lengthy statement; perhaps many of the points were covered already in  that statement. I accept that there needs to be changes in accident and  emergency. Some difficult decisions have to be made about health, particularly  when you look at the number of accident and emergency departments. We all  strive and hope for a centre of excellence in the city of Belfast to cover all  the citizens of Belfast, no matter which corner of the city they come from.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I accept that the trust had to make the decision for purely  operational reasons such as medical cover and care, which the Minister told us  about earlier. I also accept that the distances between all four accident and  emergency departments, if you bring the Ulster Hospital into the scenario, are  not great in comparison with the distance in other parts of the Province. It  needs to be more widely explained, particularly to the residents of south  Belfast, that the City Hospital is already a centre of excellence for cancer  care and other specialities and is earmarked to become a centre of excellence  for elective surgery. The Royal will be the centre for acute emergency care and  surgery. I have asked the Minister to make sure that that message gets out to  everyone.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Residents and constituents in the Donegall Road, Village  and Sandy Row areas of south Belfast have safety concerns, whether they are  ill-perceived or not, about going to the Royal. I am not so sure that those  concerns are justified, so some reassurance needs to be given to people in that  regard. Those of us who have to go in and out of the Royal and other hospitals  from time to time have not found any major problem. However, there is certainly  that perception in certain areas of the city. That is another area of concern  that needs to be addressed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is also the concern about the additional travelling  time in going to the Royal. Again, there is work that could and should be done  around that to make people understand that the extra few minutes in an ambulance  or whatever means that they will go to a unit that will give them the best  possible care.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier, I addressed with the Minister an area about which  I still have concerns. The new trauma centre at the Royal is not fully  operational, and it will not be for up to two years. I have concerns about the  40,000 extra patients. I understand that the Minister has told us about minor  units, and that needs to be welcomed. Anyone who has to go to an accident and  emergency unit or who knows doctors who work there will know that many people  arrive there who, quite frankly, should not be there. That is being addressed,  and it needs to be addressed with the public by making the public more aware  that other areas are open to them. Maybe if that were a bit better explained to  them, fewer people would go to any of the accident and emergency units in  Northern Ireland. A whole range of things needs to be done in dealing with  closure and explaining clearly to folks exactly what is happening at the City.  Having talked to the trade unions, I know that they understand that there will  be no job losses and that the City Hospital will be running to full capacity  without any reduction in staff or anything else.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the Minister&rsquo;s statement earlier, he addressed the point  that a number of people and organisations are persisting with the claim that  the closure will put lives at risk. That is devious, dangerous and totally  wrong. From whatever source they may come, those comments need to be tackled  head on and regularly. All Members of the House and politicians from the area  need to scupper those fears, because it is always vulnerable and elderly people  who will listen to those concerns. That will give them serious cause for  concern, particularly the folks who are in and out of hospital regularly. There  is work to be done to reassure the public, particularly in south Belfast, on  everything that is being put in place. I ask that the Department do that as  soon as possible to try to allay some of the fears and reassure folks that the  City Hospital will continue as a centre of excellence for medical care in  Northern Ireland into the future.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Member for securing  the debate, which has given us all an opportunity to address the issue further.  I commend the Member who has just spoken, Jimmy Spratt, because Jimmy has  touched on an undercurrent that, so far, has been unspoken. It is helpful to  get the little elephant out of the room, which is that a lot of people in  Belfast, for understandable reasons, have had what I will describe as a more  comfortable feeling with going to one hospital rather than another. That  feeling was in the minds of many people and with good reason. Thankfully,  although we still have difficulties in our city, the situation has moved on  quite considerably, and we will all welcome that very much. In the back &mdash; and  maybe even at the forefront &mdash; of the minds of some people who live in south  Belfast there is a fear of having to go to the Royal in what they think is west  Belfast, and vice versa. From my direct experience as someone who has been in  and out of hospitals quite a bit in recent years, I can understand that.  However, I believe and am satisfied that the situation has improved  considerably, and we will all want to welcome that. It is the responsibility of  all of us to try to deal with this in as mature a way as possible, without the  rhetoric, some of which Jimmy referred to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I heard a representative on TV at the beginning of the  public debate a while ago, and that person, whom I will not name, spoke for  about four minutes without even mentioning patients who might need emergency  care. That person spoke about everything bar the need for someone who requires  emergency treatment to be able to get it access to it and in very quick time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Every one of us has at the heart of our concerns &mdash; I  certainly do as a South Belfast representative, speaking specifically for that  area &mdash; making sure that all the people in this city have direct and immediate  access to emergency care if and when they, unfortunately, need it. That has to  be paramount and uppermost in our minds. Therefore, all our concerns need to be  directed at the types of contingency plans that the Minister referred to  earlier and will, I presume, address again during the debate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The capacity of other institutions to absorb an increase in  attendance is of paramount importance. The decision has been taken, and the  closure will happen. Whether it is temporary or otherwise is a discussion for  another day. We can be as cynical as we wish, but the decision is taken, and I  want to make sure that, hand on heart, I can face my constituents and say that  we have made representations to the Minister on specific issues relating to the  capacity of other places to absorb the additional number of people who attend,  what may happen to the workforce that currently services the City, and so on.  However, the primary question is: how will the people who currently use the  Belfast City Hospital facilities fare if they need to use those services in the  future? That is the only issue that I want to address.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Having listened to the debate and to the Minister earlier,  I too wonder about some issues. There was some discussion recently and then the  announcement, which has been described as &ldquo;premature&rdquo;, was made. If everybody  knew about it, why was nothing done sooner, rather than waiting or taking  &ldquo;premature&rdquo; decisions? I am not entirely sure of the right way of all this, but  I listened very carefully to what the Minister said earlier. If it has taken  the clinicians, professionals, experts, consultants and doctors to say, &ldquo;We are  going no further with this&rdquo;, where was the management? I do not mean in the  past two weeks, because the Minister has been in post only since May or June.  Where was the management over the past year or two when the problem was  building up? I am not really interested in getting the answer to that today,  but those are fundamental issues that need to be addressed in the longer term.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This closure has been described by the Minister as  temporary. If the deficits are met, the service is stabilised and people are  safe to attend hospital to get emergency care when they need it, the  longer-term management of the service still has to be addressed. So I would  like to think that lessons have been learned, and I presume and hope that  lessons have been learned from the failure to either address or redress the  difficulties that have brought us to the point where medical professionals are  telling us that they are no longer prepared to stand over the situation. If  medical professionals have said, &ldquo;I am sorry but I am not prepared to stand  over the situation any longer&rdquo;, I fail to see how anybody can describe a  decision as &ldquo;premature&rdquo;. I do not understand that. I would like to think that  decisive action would have been taken and a decision made.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, like every other representative of the  constituency, I am aware, as I said when the Minister made the statement to the  Assembly this afternoon, that any other set of constituency MLAs could stand  here and complain about or address the issue of the closure of an A&amp;E  department in their constituency. As a South Belfast representative, my primary  concern is for the safety and well-being of the constituents that I have the  privilege to represent, and I was satisfied, perhaps considerably so, by the  Minister&rsquo;s responses earlier.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to continue to make sure that the public  hear as often and as clearly as possible what the contingency plans are; what  measures are in place; and what responsible actions the public can take, which  the Minister referred to on occasions, to reduce the pressure on A&amp;Es, no  matter where they are. I wish the Minister well in his task of convincing the  public that the service that they will rely on will be safe and secure.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member must draw his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  I hope that the public in south Belfast, or anywhere else, can look forward in  the longer term to having safe and secure services.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  I am grateful to Mr McDevitt for securing the debate. It is on an issue which,  as Mr Spratt said, is causing serious concerns in south Belfast. It is a  controversial decision. The A&amp;E at the City Hospital is closing. It is an  A&amp;E that currently accommodates 42,000 visits a year; that is virtually  1,000 a week. We are on the cusp of winter pressures, and, as the weather gets  colder, we will see a dramatic increase in the number of visits to all of our  A&amp;Es &mdash; not just for orthopaedic services but also by our elderly population  and because of flu-related symptoms and so on. This is exactly the time of the  year when we look to our A&amp;Es to perform at their best.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are all aware that, as far as Belfast is concerned, we  have the Royal, Mater and City hospitals. The Mater accommodates 40,000 visits  a year and the Royal around 70,000. The Royal is clearly our major A&amp;E. The  strategy for the Health Service was begun by Mr Maskey&rsquo;s party, Sinn F&eacute;in,  under Developing Better Services. It is useful to remember what Developing  Better Services said, because that is the strategy that we have been following.  Had capital funds and investment been available properly, as they should have  been over the years, we would be much further on in developing that strategy,  which was for a major new critical-care building at the Royal. I was personally  pleased, as Minister, to go forward with that at a cost of, I think, &pound;190  million. That will provide a brand new accident and emergency, intensive care,  and acute surgery facilities &mdash; all that we would expect from a modern,  up-to-date regional centre for A&amp;E. That is now two years away from  completion of its four-year build.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Under the strategy, it was always envisaged that the Mater  would be a local hospital. Local hospitals have minor-injuries units, but, as  an enhanced local hospital, the Mater would have certain other extras, not  least ophthalmology services. That the Mater would have a minor-injuries  service was laid down with Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s signature very much underneath it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The City Hospital would be a major acute hospital, a  teaching hospital with an A&amp;E. It was envisaged that that A&amp;E would or  should continue until the new Royal A&amp;E service in the critical-care unit  was in operation. That is why a gap is developing here. Those 42,000 patients a  year who visit the City Hospital will not be accommodated in future; therefore,  there will be a gap. So, you look to see where that gap will be filled. Well,  it seems to me that it will not be filled at the Ulster Hospital, because the  Ulster was designed for 30,000 visits a year, and it is already handling more  than 70,000.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s announcement today that the South  Eastern Health and Social Care Trust has recruited three extra A&amp;E  consultants for the Ulster. That will certainly help the hospital&rsquo;s throughput,  although it begs the question why we cannot recruit three extra consultants for  the City Hospital as well, because the lack of middle-grade doctors appears to  be the problem or the issue here. That would allow, as was always envisaged,  the City Hospital A&amp;E to continue until the Royal has the capacity to  shoulder the burden. Remember that the Royal A&amp;E unit is currently in a  temporary building. The Royal A&amp;E was demolished several years ago to make  way for the critical-care unit, and it is currently housed in a large temporary  metal building. It is a good temporary building, but that is what it is &mdash;  temporary.<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There will be serious disruption at the A&amp;E at the  Royal when the new critical care unit is ready and we have to locate from the  temporary A&amp;E into the critical care unit. A number of issues have been in  the planning, upsetting the plan, turning it upside down and causing surprise.  Frankly, that is where we are coming from. Had it been the Mater going to a  minor injuries unit to remove staff from the Mater to the City, that I could  have understood. However, taking staff to maintain the Mater A&amp;E, for  example, knowing that the Mater A&amp;E will be a minor injuries unit in a  couple of years from now, took me by surprise.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Hospital also requires a new A&amp;E. As the  Minister said, under the current investment strategy for Northern Ireland plan,  there is so little money going into health that it is nearly nine years away.  Of course, if the money were available, it could be ready within two years, as  it is all set and ready to go. Those issues are of concern to the population.  It is about capacity. Will there be an A&amp;E available, and will it be able  to deliver the service for patients coming through the door within the 12-hour  target?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, there is the issue of winter pressures. There is  also an issue that relates to the Minister&rsquo;s earlier remarks, when he appeared  to say that the General Medical Council wrote to say that it was not going to  provide support or cover for the City Hospital A&amp;E, which, effectively,  forced our hand. I need further clarification on that, and I would be concerned  if that is what came from the General Medical Council (GMC). However, I will  check the Hansard report to see the Minister&rsquo;s precise remarks. Nevertheless, I  took it that the GMC was the cause of the issue, and we should not take that  lightly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a capacity issue and an issue of confidence. It  seems to be a bad day for south Belfast. We are losing our constituency &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member draw his remarks to a close?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  Yes, thank you. We are losing our constituency, and we are losing our A&amp;E  at very short notice with winter pressures coming. I need some more convincing.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I welcome the opportunity to respond to the debate in place of my party colleague  Anna Lo, who represents South Belfast. Unfortunately, she is unable to be  present. I also thank the Member for South Belfast Mr McDevitt for securing  this important debate.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: On  a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Could something be done about the PA  system? There seems to be inordinate interference, which is making it difficult  to hear. We all want to hear the pearls of wisdom from Mr McCarthy, but the  present system is giving us deep difficulties.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Can you not hear me, Jim?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The fact that it has been referred to will probably be picked up  by our technical department and, hopefully, resolved.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  My colleague Anna Lo has met the Minister and written to the chairman of the  Belfast Health and Social Care Trust on the issue. It is also an issue that I  am familiar with as I am a member of the Health Committee. Indeed, I questioned  the Minister on the day that he announced to the Committee the decision on the  A&amp;E at the City Hospital. Given the difficult financial times, the state of  the budget and the lack of practitioners and doctors etc, we realise that there  is a need for a review of the health estate and that the current provision of  four accident and emergency units in Belfast must be looked at. Duplication  must be avoided at all costs. We must also take account of the opinion of  medical professionals on adequate and safe staffing in all our health service  provision. However, before steps are taken to close the A&amp;E unit at the  City Hospital, it is important that there is sufficient provision in place  elsewhere to ensure that the more than 40,000 patients who will be forced to  travel further will not then be subject to excessive waits elsewhere.  Currently, the Royal Victoria Hospital does not have the necessary  infrastructure to deal with the arrival of such a large number of extra  patients a year. With only 24 A&amp;E cubicles, it is difficult to see how it  will be expected to cope with that huge rise in the number of patients.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I accept the statement made by the Minister in the House  today in relation to the A&amp;E at the City Hospital. As it stands, the Royal  is finding it difficult to cope with patient levels. In June 2011, 56 patients  waited over 12 hours at the Royal. The Ulster Hospital in Dundonald, which,  surely, will also see a large uplift in the number of patients visiting its  A&amp;E, as has been acknowledged already today, had 155 people wait for over  12 hours in the same month. Therefore, although there may be a financial need  for rationalisation in the health service, it cannot come at a risk to patient  care or even at the risk of creating lengthier waiting lists for patients  because the necessary infrastructure is not in place to allow the remaining  accident and emergency units to cope.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I urge the Minister to ensure that he is taking all  adequate steps, such as public education campaigns, to reduce the number of  people who attend accident and emergency units when their needs could be much  better serviced elsewhere. I mentioned that to the Minister following his  statement today. I acknowledge that the Minister answered my question on that.  He advised the Assembly of his efforts to help with that issue. Currently, too  many people, for one reason or another, use A&amp;E units as an alternative to  visiting their GP. They use an out-of-hours doctor or visit a minor injuries  unit. If those numbers were reduced, the strain on all our A&amp;E units would  be eased significantly. I sincerely hope that that message can get out to  everyone.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I call on the Minister to ensure that every effort is made  to put in place sufficient upgrades in surrounding A&amp;E units to ensure that  patients do not suffer unduly from any rationalisation in the health service in  Belfast.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots (The  Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety)</strong>: I am grateful for  the opportunity to listen to Members&rsquo; comments and to respond to the important  debate on the changes to Belfast City Hospital&rsquo;s emergency department. I have  already made a comprehensive statement on the matter this afternoon, and, in  the interests of time, I do not wish to repeat all that was in that statement.  However, I want to reiterate a number of points and deal with some of the  issues that have been raised by Members.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let me be clear at the outset that the safety of patients  is my number one concern, and I want to assure the people of south Belfast that  there is and will continue to be access to appropriate emergency services for  all those who need them. The urgent and necessary decision by the Belfast Trust  to reconfigure the emergency department services on two sites and alter  provision in Belfast City Hospital is an operational matter that was taken in  the interests of safety and sustainability of services. Those who say that  people will die as a result of the decision are wrong. We are doing this to  ensure that the patients are dealt with safely and appropriately and to ensure  that there is proper and adequate cover at our hospitals, something that has not  been the case in the past.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I explained earlier, I am advised that the Belfast Trust  considered other options, including reducing the opening hours of the City  Hospital emergency department or putting in place a minor injuries unit. It  must also be remembered that the Royal site is the regional trauma unit for  Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The changes, as proposed, are not to take place until 1  November 2011, but that does not mean that acute admissions to Belfast City  Hospital will stop. The model being designed for Belfast City Hospital,  although it still needs some refinement, will see acute admissions to the  hospital through a medical admissions unit and an acute assessment facility.  Patient pathways will also be in place for certain specialty admissions.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">6.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It should also be said that the future of Belfast City  Hospital is not under threat as a result of the removal of emergency services  at this time because of urgent requirements. The hospital provides a superb  service, particularly in urology and nephrology, and is the regional cancer  centre for Northern Ireland. One of the first things that I did as Minister was  to propose further investment in the hospital through new lines for the  radiotherapy unit in association with the proposal to develop the cancer centre  at Altnagelvin Hospital. So, I am committed to ensuring that the Belfast City  Hospital remains and remains as a teaching facility.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will deal with the issue that Mr McGimpsey raised  regarding the GMC. The GMC did threaten very clearly to withdraw teaching  status on the back of the Northern Ireland Medical and Dental Training Agency  (NIMDTA) report produced in June. The August response was a response &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  will give way.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The August response was a response to the report produced  in June by NIMDTA. This was not some cynical, stage-managed exercise. It was  the GMC&rsquo;s response to a NIMDTA report that gave the Belfast City Hospital and  Royal Victoria sites F grades.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I thank the Minister for giving way. I think that that is an important point  that we all need clarity on. I have just heard the Minister say that the GMC  threatened to withdraw the teaching status of the hospital. Earlier, I certainly  got the impression that the Minister was saying that the GMC was threatening to  withdraw medical cover. I welcome that clarification. I am sure that lots of  people will do so.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  The GMC has considerable concern about the status of the junior doctors. It  wants to ensure that they have adequate training, supervision and professional  oversight. That is for two reasons: for training purposes and to ensure that  junior doctors are not making decisions that they should not be making and that  others are making those key life-and-death decisions. It is inappropriate to  put junior doctors in a position in which they are making life-and-death  decisions without having had the proper opportunity to have adequate training  to make those decisions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also acknowledge that the south Belfast people who  present themselves to an emergency department will have to do so at either the  Royal or the Mater hospitals. Mr Spratt and Mr Maskey made the point that there  are people in south Belfast who feel a little uncomfortable going to west  Belfast. That should not be the case. Our hospitals should be neutral venues.  However, Northern Ireland is an unusual place in many respects, and we still  have throwbacks to the period of the Troubles.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  Will the Minister comment on the fact that the Mater Hospital is used equally  by residents of the Shankill, the Crumlin Road, Ligoniel and Glengormley with  no difficulty whatsoever? That seems to indicate a model by which all our  hospitals in Northern Ireland could be seen as neutral spaces that everyone can  use safely.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  That is the case. The Mater Hospital is used extensively by both sides of the  community.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I understand why people in the Village and Sandy Row may  feel a little uncomfortable about going to the Royal. I have used the emergency  department in the Royal. I have sat there for many hours with my disabled  brother, and, as would normally be the case, I did not have any problems,.  Perhaps the fear that some members of the public have is misplaced. There are  alternatives, of course. There are other sites that people can go to, including  the Ulster Hospital site and the Mater, if they feel uncomfortable about  visiting an emergency department in a particular area but need care. However,  we have to get to a point where people can overcome those issues and problems.  That should not be an issue that clouds our decision-making. Belfast City  Council has something like 13 leisure centres because people will not cross  boundaries, and that has added a huge cost to that council.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I note that the driving distance from the City Hospital to  the Royal Hospital is 1&middot;2 miles and from the City Hospital to the Mater  Hospital the driving distance is 2&middot;1 miles. That causes a further inconvenience  for some people in south Belfast, but it has to be balanced against the need,  which is far greater, to have safe, high-quality services with better access to  senior doctors and greater supervision of junior doctors, especially out of  hours and at weekends.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is my understanding that there will be no staff  reductions, which is a very important issue for the trade unions, but there  will be a requirement for staff reconfiguration. The trust has discussed those  changes with relevant staff and will continue to do so.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There will also be full communication with the public,  other trusts and GPs on those temporary changes, and that will be done through  a number of mechanisms. Advertisements will be put up in GP surgeries,  pharmacies, post offices and our universities. The promotion of relevant  information will be done through all appropriate media and press outlets. The  changes will be promoted to the media through organisational advocates who will  be mandated to explain the necessity for the changes and their value to  patients. There will be extensive public advertisement of the changes in the  run-up to the date of the service transfer; provision of relevant information  through trust, board and other suitably accessible website facilities; and  sharing of information with key interest groups, such as elected  representatives, trade unions and other stakeholder interests, including GPs,  through an ongoing programme of meetings.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I assure you that the changes will be closely monitored by  the Belfast Trust, the HSC Board and me. Members will have gathered from the  discussion that took place earlier today and, indeed, from this debate that  this was coming and has been coming for some time. There have been evident  signs that that was the case. I pose this question to the House: how was it  that the Ulster Hospital was in a position to recruit three additional  consultants to that facility and the City Hospital was not in a position to  ensure that there was adequate cover of registrars and consultants to maintain  the service there? I suspect that, if people were concerned about the City  Hospital, perhaps they took their eye off the ball when they had the  opportunity to ensure that the situation that I was given was not better for  the Belfast City Hospital emergency department.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the longer term, we have a strategic decision to make on  the provision of emergency department services in the greater Belfast area. I  reassure the people of Belfast and, in particular, those who live in south  Belfast that I will not make any permanent decision without a full and open  process of consultation and engagement. Consultation on these matters is likely  to happen early in the new year, and, following careful consideration of those  consultation responses, I anticipate taking a strategic decision on them later  in 2012.</p>
