    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Motion proposed [24 May]:</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes that April 2010 marked both the  fortieth anniversary of the dissolution of the Ulster Special Constabulary, or  B-Specials, and also the fortieth anniversary of the formation of the Ulster  Defence Regiment; expresses its gratitude to the bravery of the many people who  served in each; acknowledges the sacrifice made by many personnel as they  defended the population against terrorism; and calls on the Secretary of State  for Northern Ireland to mark these two important anniversaries. &mdash; [Mr Storey.]</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I remind Members that a valid petition of concern was presented yesterday,  Monday 24 May, on the motion on the fortieth anniversary of the disbanding of  the B-Specials and the formation of the UDR.

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Second Stage of the Sunbeds Bill (NIA 18/09) be  agreed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Over the past 25 years, skin cancer rates in Northern Ireland  have trebled. That is a shocking statistic that we cannot ignore. Skin cancer  is now the most common cancer here, and it affects 28% of all individuals  diagnosed with cancer. There is convincing evidence that exposure to  ultraviolet (UV) radiation can cause skin cancer and other health conditions.  That is true of natural UV rays from sunlight or UV radiation from artificial  tanning devices. Each year, around 100 people in the UK die from melanomas that are due  to sunbed use. That equates to two or three deaths a year in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Research also shows that the risk of melanoma increases by  75% for those who start using sunbeds before the age of 30. Despite the obvious  dangers, however, we have evidence that shows that more and more young people  are using sunbeds. A UK  survey indicated that 6% of 11- to 17-year-olds have used a sunbed. More  worryingly, a Scottish study reported that 7% of children between eight and 11  years old had used a sunbed. An Omnibus population survey in Northern Ireland  in 2008 recorded that 28% of women and 8% of men had used sunbeds.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is an additional risk factor. Our pale skin is the  type that burns easily and is very vulnerable to the harmful effects of UV  radiation. Of course, sunbeds are not the only cause of skin cancers. The point  is that excessive exposure to UV radiation, particularly in younger people, has  been shown to cause skin cancer and other conditions later in life. Sunbeds are  an additional and unnecessary source of exposure to the very real risk of  getting skin cancer.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At present in Northern Ireland the indoor tanning  industry is not subject to any form of direct statutory regulation or age  restriction. We have survey evidence that shows how an unregulated sunbed  industry behaves. In 2007, environmental health officers carried out a survey  of 332 sunbed premises across Northern    Ireland, and their main findings gave cause  for concern. The survey revealed a wide variation in operating practices and  poor standards among some providers. One significant fact that emerged from the  survey was that only about 16% of operators in Northern Ireland belong to the  Sunbed Association. That suggests that the alternative to regulation &mdash; a  voluntary code of practice &mdash; would achieve little to reduce the harm done by  artificial UV devices.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The key aim of the Bill to regulate the sunbed industry is  to reduce the number of cases and deaths from skin cancer caused by sunbeds.  This is not about spoiling anyone&rsquo;s fun. I know that tanned skin is  fashionable, and the weather in Northern    Ireland does not oblige. However, that does  not make the increased use of sunbeds safe or acceptable. Sunbeds appear to  offer a quick and harmless alternative to natural sunlight, but they are not  harmless. The evidence linking sunbed usage to the development of all skin  cancers is growing. The advice from a number of expert bodies recommends that  the cosmetic use of sunbeds, especially by children, should be discouraged  because of the associated increased risk of skin cancer and other health  problems. The Bill aims to eliminate as far as possible the use of sunbeds by  children and young people under 18 years of age. It also aims to ensure that  adults intending to use sunbeds are more aware of the potential risks to their  health.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Just as worrying is the fact that across the UK there are  around twice as many commercial sunbed outlets in deprived areas as there are  in more affluent areas. Therefore, not only are sunbeds a risk to health;  evidence shows that they contribute directly to health inequalities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The measures in the Sunbeds Bill will deliver significant  public health benefits in the longer term, in particular to reduce the number  of cases of and deaths from skin cancer. The Bill will aim to achieve that  through the following provisions. It will prevent children and young people  under 18 from using, buying or hiring sunbeds. It will make it illegal to  operate unsupervised sunbed premises, and we know of cases in which children in  England  and Wales have been badly burned by using sunbeds in such premises. The Bill  will ensure that adults are warned about the health risks through the display  of health warning signs and detailed written information; prevent operators  from making spurious claims about the health benefits to be had from sunbeds;  make the use of eyewear compulsory; and set out the need for staff training and  for sunbeds to comply with certain standards. Finally, the Bill will require  sunbed premises to be registered with district councils. It will be illegal to  operate sunbeds commercially without registering the premises. Such  registration will apply to premises that hire or sell sunbeds. Those provisions  will be enforced by district councils through their environmental health  officers, as they already carry out enforcement in relation to sunbeds from a  health and safety perspective.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When my Department consulted on proposals for regulating  sunbeds, it included a proposal to introduce a registration scheme. An alternative  to a registration scheme is a licensing scheme, which would be much more  elaborate. I am not convinced that the licensing of sunbed premises at this  time would be an effective and proportionate response to the problems that have  been identified. The inclusion of a licensing scheme in the Sunbeds Bill would  have required me to develop proposals and hold further consultation. That would  have prevented the Bill, with its significant measures for regulating the  industry, from completing its passage through the Assembly within the current  mandate. Rather than delay, it is much better to move ahead with registration,  which can be done more quickly and will be very effective. If it proves  necessary, my Department will develop proposals for licensing the industry.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Sunbed regulation is now law elsewhere in the UK. Scotland  introduced measures in 2008 to regulate the sunbed industry, and they came into  effect in December 2009. Legislation covering England  and Wales  received Royal Assent in April 2010, and those provisions will come into effect  from April 2011. The measures that I am proposing in the Sunbeds Bill go  further than the legislation for Scotland  and for England and Wales. I have  included provisions on compulsory training, technical standards for sunbeds and  the registration of premises.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I believe that the measures contained in the Bill are  workable, fair and compatible with other statutes, such as the Human Rights Act  1998. The Bill will ensure that the sunbed industry is properly regulated and  that more people are aware of the potential serious risks to their health. Most  importantly, the Bill will help to reduce the number of people, particularly  young people, getting skin cancer and will save lives.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr Wells)</strong>:  I welcome the Sunbeds Bill on behalf of the Committee for Health, Social  Services and Public Safety. There are a few issues that I will outline, but we  are broadly content with and support the principles of the Bill as presented.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee was aware that a consultation on the  regulation of sunbeds took place in late 2009. However, we did not expect the  departmental officials to tell us in March 2010 that they were bringing forward  a full Bill. That was a surprise to us, and we would have welcomed better  notice. That said, the Committee is in complete agreement with the underlying  principle of the Bill, which is to prevent the use of sunbeds by those under 18  and ensure that those over that age who use sunbeds are better informed about  the risks.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On 18 March, the Committee heard from officials that the  case to ban sunbeds for under 18s was strong. We heard that the four United  Kingdom Health Departments had commissioned the Committee on Medical Aspects of  Radiation in the Environment to consider the evidence linking sunbeds with skin  cancers. That body reported in mid-2009 and provided a series of  recommendations for the regulation of sunbeds.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee also heard that young people in particular  are at risk from sunbed sessions. Not only has there been a sharp increase in  the use of sunbeds by young people, there is a link between the prevalence of  commercial sunbed outlets and deprivation. While the Committee was considering  the Bill, any time that I was in towns throughout Northern Ireland, I took the  opportunity to check where sunbed premises were located. The number of such  outlets located in areas of deprivation is amazing, and that is a matter of  concern. In Northern Ireland,  there are already too many health issues that are linked to deprivation, and  the Committee fully supports any action that will tackle health inequalities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Young people who use sunbeds endanger their life. Skin  cancer is a terrible disease from which to die, and each year in Northern Ireland  two or three people die from melanomas that are directly related to sunbed use.  It is a serious issue: it is a life-and-death issue as far as our young people  are concerned.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On 18 March, the Committee was told that the Department was  considering the merits of a licensing scheme for sunbed regulation, but that it  was leaning towards not introducing the scheme for a number of reasons. The  Committee explored those factors with the officials. The reasons included the  fact that the Department believed that licensing would be a response  disproportionate to the health benefits that might be achieved and that it  might not be possible to develop a licensing scheme in the time available.  Officials also pointed out that registration or licensing schemes have not been  introduced in Scotland, Wales or England. The Bill, as introduced,  does not include licensing. The Committee has some reservations about that and  will be exploring the issue fully in the coming weeks.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Departmental officials pointed out that there are around 400  sunbed outlets in Northern    Ireland. That equates to around 15 outlets  in each district council area in the Province. We do not believe that it would  be a huge burden on councils, either from an administrative or financial point  of view, to operate a licensing scheme. Members will be aware that councils  already operate widespread licensing schemes for other premises, so I do not  think that it would require the creation of a new department or a significant  investment in new staff. We believe that it would be better if councils were  able to investigate a sunbed outlet and close it down if it was operating  outside the rules. We see that as being a very effective deterrent in  controlling those institutions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee also explored and will continue to explore  the argument about the lack of time. It should be possible to introduce  overarching legislation and deal with particulars through subordinate  legislation. As the Bill stands, it contains clauses that do exactly that. For  example, the introduction of technical specifications for sunbeds and mandatory  training for sunbed operators are allowed for in the Bill but will be  introduced at a later stage when details are finalised. The Committee will  explore why a similar approach could not be introduced for licensing. The fact  that no other country has gone down the route of licensing does not really add  up. Why should Northern Ireland  not be the first to do so and go one better than other countries in the UK in the  protection of our young people?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee also expressed concern about licensing and  companies that hire out sunbeds privately. Although the issue is dealt with in  the Bill, some members, including the Deputy Chairperson, are concerned that,  without licensing, the Bill has no teeth. A company that deliberately leases a  sunbed to an under 18 may be happy to pay the fine and keep on operating and  breaking the law. We note that the Bill allows for a fine of &pound;2,500 to be  levied in such a situation. That is a substantial amount given the profit  margin that a company would make from hiring out the sunbed. However, the  company would have to be caught, and the fine would not be anything like the  maximum of &pound;2,500 for the first offence. So, what is to stop a company  reoffending? The Committee understands that a balance must be struck between  having regulation and driving operators underground, which may create a black  market. We expect to have an interesting discussion about that in Committee.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One point raised by the Committee was the duty of care  placed on private individuals who buy or hire sunbeds for their home not to  allow under 18s to use them. Any parent could buy or hire a sunbed for their  own use, and, while they were at work, their teenage son or, more likely, their  teenage daughter could be using it with their friends. The Committee realises  that it is an extremely difficult issue to enforce but is concerned that there  is no duty on the individual despite the difficulties with enforcement. The  example used at the meeting was alcohol. It is legal for someone over 18 to buy  it for their own consumption, but that person has a duty to ensure that no one  under the age of 18 drinks it. It is a child protection issue, but,  importantly, it gives out a message about personal and individual responsibility.  The Committee is likely to want to explore that area.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.00 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to finish on a positive note. The Committee is  delighted by the introduction of the Bill. We fully support its principles,  although we reserve the right to say that it does not go far enough. We are  pleased that the Executive have found time for the Bill in their legislative  programme, and we look forward to giving it detailed consideration at Committee  Stage.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. As Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s health spokesperson, I  welcome the Second Stage of the Sunbeds Bill. I put on record that I agree with  its principles and what it attempts to achieve. However, I also wish to put on  record that Sinn F&eacute;in has some concern about licensing and feels that the Bill  does not go far enough in some respects. Sinn F&eacute;in fully supports the moves to  prevent the use of sunbeds by those aged under 18 and to ensure that those aged  18 and over are fully aware of the risks and health implications, so that they  can make informed choices.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Cancer Research UK forwarded a briefing paper to  Committee members, which stated that sunbeds have been linked to a variety of  health conditions. The Minister referred to many of those conditions, which  include eye damage, photodermatosis, photosensitivity, premature skin-ageing  and skin cancer. People who use sunbeds must be fully aware of those  implications.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson mentioned that the Committee was briefed by  departmental officials. We were informed of the particular dangers that sunbeds  pose to young people. Officials at that meeting referred to the sharp rise in  the numbers of young people who use sunbeds, and the Minister mentioned that  today. The direct correlation between sunbed outlets and areas of deprivation  was also highlighted. I am keen to explore those matters further at Committee  Stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Undoubtedly, some sunbed operators run their businesses  responsibly, and I spoke to people at one such business last week. Responsible  operators support licensing, because they consider that it would be to the  advantage of their trade and it would weed out irresponsible operators. That is  another matter that we will be keen to explore further at Committee Stage. We  broadly support the Bill&rsquo;s principles. At the evidence session, the officials  said that the Department&rsquo;s mind was not closed to the idea of licensing.  However, the Minister said today that such a move would delay the legislation.  Given that licensing may be the only way properly to safeguard people who use  sunbeds, we must explore that area further. I have no desire to hold up  legislation or to delay the improvement of the current position, but I do not  want to miss an opportunity to push the boundaries as far as we can.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At the Committee briefing, officials said that there are  somewhere in the region of 400 sunbed operators here. Those are spread around  all the councils, and, therefore, environmental health and public health  departments will not be placed under a disproportionate burden through having  to regulate and monitor the situation. I look forward to Committee Stage.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  I support the Bill that the Health Minister has introduced. It is overdue.  According to the Northern Ireland Cancer Registry, the number of people with  skin cancer in Northern    Ireland has trebled in the past decade,  which is genuinely alarming. Despite all the cuts that are being imposed on the  Minister, I ask him carefully to consider the expansion of skin cancer  provision across the Health Service. That could begin with the provision of an  additional consultant post and relevant supporting systems at the Royal Victoria   Hospital, for example, to  serve the entire Province.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Dr Dolan, a skincare specialist at the Royal Victoria   Hospital, said that the  exposure to harmful quantities of sunlight at an early age resulted from the  wide availability of foreign holidays since 1970. Young people&rsquo;s exposure to  sunbeds adds to the problem, and the Minister is right to takes steps to  improve regulation. He pointed out that research shows that using sunbeds  before the age of 30 may increase a person&rsquo;s risk of developing melanoma skin  cancer by up to 75%. In the United    Kingdom, melanoma due to sunbed use alone is  estimated to be cause approximately 100 deaths every year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill creates regulation where it is sorely needed: it  prohibits operators of sunbed premises from allowing anyone under 18 years of  age to use sunbeds on their premises; it prohibits the sale or hire of sunbeds  to anyone under the age of 18; it prohibits operators from allowing sunbeds to  be used in unsupervised premises; and it places a duty on operators of sunbed  premises to provide users of sunbeds with written information on the health  risks associated with their use.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some 28% of all cancers that are diagnosed in Northern Ireland  are skin cancers. I am sure that every responsible owner of sunbed premises  will agree with this measure, and I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I apologise to the Speaker and to the House; other business has me slightly  stretched today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Bill. Members who spoke previously noted  that, in this respect, the Assembly is showing leadership not just at a  regional level but across these islands. That leadership has come about after  years of local government ensuring that sunbeds are seen for what they are &mdash;  potentially dangerous machines.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome much in the Bill, and I acknowledge the sterling  work of officials and the leadership that has been shown by the Minister on  this issue. However, there is a potential gap, which, at this early stage of  the legislative process, deserves to be raised and reflected upon. The Bill has  many good provisions. For example, it will make it impossible for minors to  privately hire a sunbed in a tanning salon or for them to use a sunbed on the  premises. It will also make it impossible for someone under the age of 18 to  buy a sunbed, which is a welcome step.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, the Bill is silent on whether someone who  privately buys a sunbed will be under any specific duty to ensure that no one  under the age of 18 uses it. That is an important point for two reasons. As we  know from research and from our experience at local government level, here and  in other parts of these islands, girls under the age of 18 from  socio-economically deprived backgrounds are one of the groups that is most likely  to abuse and overuse a sunbed. The use of sunbeds is higher among that group of  people &mdash; the very group that we are trying to target with this legislation &mdash; in  the parts of our region where people are less well off. In doing such sterling  work and making such good provision to control the use of sunbeds for that very  demographic, but by failing to impose a duty on individuals who purchase a  sunbed privately from preventing it being used privately &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Does the Member have figures to suggest how many people from deprived  backgrounds use sunbeds, be it through private ownership or a tanning salon? Is  there widespread ownership of sunbeds in more deprived communities?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I thank Mr McCallister for his intervention. It is an important question. As I  understand it, the figures that are available to us suggest that, at present,  private ownership of sunbeds is not widespread. That is because public hire of  sunbeds is readily available. One reason why the legislation has been brought  to the House is because minors from socio-economically deprived backgrounds  avail themselves of sunbeds for public hire. The number of sunbed salons has  mushroomed and the trade has flourished in some of our more deprived  communities for that very reason.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The legislation will rightly control access by children to  those salons. However, we must make sure that it does not, by accident, create  another opportunity. That is my fear. In Committee, as John McCallister will  remember, I raised a question with officials about whether we could introduce a  basic licensing system for the private purchase of sunbeds by adults.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Such a basic licence should put the purchaser under a  statutory duty to ensure that the machine that they are purchasing privately  does not end up being available to children. That is the only gap in the Bill,  but it is a significant one. I welcome the Bill&rsquo;s Second Stage, but I appeal to  the Minister and his officials to reflect on that point and I urge them to  consider whether the legislation can be tightened in its future stages to  prevent a possible black market. Doing so would avoid driving the issue  underground.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I believe, and there is probably a consensus at Committee  level among colleagues who have spoken, that requiring private purchasers to  obtain a licence and to be under a statutory obligation to ensure that a sunbed  is never used by a minor in any place, with or without payment, would be an  important way of rounding off what we all agree is a significant and worthwhile  Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Deeny</strong>: As  a member of the Health Committee, I welcome the Bill and the Second Stage  debate, and I look forward to further debate at Committee Stage. The Bill is  important because it is about preventing unnecessary loss of life and educating  the public. I would like to see the legislation introduced in Northern Ireland  and I agree with Members that there is no reason why we should not take the  lead.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is well known that ultraviolet emissions cause cancer;  sunbeds produce more such emissions than the Mediterranean midday sun. With  75,000 cases, skin cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in the UK. Of those  skin cancers, malignant melanoma is the least common but most dangerous. Northern Ireland has 259 of the 10,410 new cases  of malignant melanoma diagnosed in the UK each year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The incidence of malignant melanoma increases with age.  However, the worrying trend is that its incidence is increasing among our young  people. It is now the most common cancer in our young adults: those aged  between 15 and 34. That development is of concern to any of us who deal with or  have children. Another worrying statistic that underlines the importance of the  debate is that, of all the major cancers, malignant melanoma has seen the  largest increase in incidence over the past 25 years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Melanoma can be a killer. An old friend of mine whom I had  not seen for some years lost his young wife to malignant melanoma. It is a very  serious issue, which is why we should treat it as such. Addiction to sunbed use  is another issue. We know that certain behaviour patterns are associated with  such an addiction: addictive people become addicted to sunbeds. That is  something that we must look at as it reflects the seriousness of the overuse of  sunbeds.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Members said, we need to target certain individuals and  groups, particularly the young and, specifically, young females and those with  fair skin or those who have a personal or family history of skin cancer.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The whole emphasis is on regulation. It is about better  informing people and them taking personal responsibility. A study asked people  in Northern Ireland  about their skin types, which are divided according to colour. Forty per cent  of the public in Northern    Ireland believed that they had skin type 1  or 2, which is naturally fair skinned. However, the reality is different: Northern Ireland  has a predominantly fair-skinned population. That goes to show that although  personal responsibility is very important, some people do not realise that they  are fair-skinned and are at risk.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill contains a lot of suggestions from the British  Association of Dermatologists. We talked about restricting sunbed use for  people under 18 years of age, but it is more important to ban our under-18  population from using them. The Bill also bans the sale or hire of sunbeds to  the under 18s. In addition, we should have a total ban on coin-operated,  unmanned sunbeds. It is essential for the health of our people that there is  full-time supervision of sunbed facilities by trained staff. Furthermore, it is  important that there is the compulsory display and provision of customer  information regarding the health risks, because one of the causes of skin  cancer from sunbeds is overexposure. We must limit the number of tanning  sessions that people have. I have heard of sunbeds being used in health  facilities. It is very important that that is dealt with because it sends out  the conflicting message that sunbeds are healthy. Sunbeds should be removed  from all gymnasiums, leisure centres and health centres.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I disagree with the Minister on the issue of licensing. It  is a very important and serious issue, and licensing should be introduced.  Licences are needed for cars, guns, TVs and even dogs, so why are they not  needed for a potentially lethal weapon, such as a sunbed? Mention was made of  our local authorities regulating licences, and that is important. It is also  important that licences be subject to regular inspections and that a power  exists to revoke licences.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Does the  Member agree that in the short discussion that the Committee had about this  issue, there were only really two issues between us and the Department? One was  raised by the Member for South Belfast Mr McDevitt, and that is a duty of care  on those who hire out sunbeds to prevent them from being used by the under 18s.  The second is the more overarching issue of licensing. Does the Member accept  that the Minister may wish to take the opportunity to go through the arguments  that his departmental officials have given about why licensing is not  appropriate? The more we examine them, the less water they seem to hold. Down  District Council issues thousands of licences every year for everything from  dogs and caravan sites to entertainment licences for nightclubs. Therefore, an  extra 15 licences a year would have absolutely no impact on the administrative  burden of my council or, perhaps, on that of the other 25 councils in Northern Ireland.  Will the Member urge the Minister to reflect on that and perhaps to address  those issues when he makes his summation at the end of the debate?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Deeny</strong>: I  thank Mr Wells for his intervention. I agree, and I would like to hear the  Minister&rsquo;s comments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If it is an issue of timing, to which I think the Minister  alluded earlier, licensing should be looked at as carefully as possible because  of its importance: we are talking about people&rsquo;s lives. Therefore, if timing is  the issue, it is not a big enough reason not to take licensing on board. Many  of us think that licensing should form an important part of sunbed legislation  here.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson of the Health Committee compared sunbed  licensing with other licensed activities. For example, alcohol use is also  considered to be an addictive behaviour, so those in society who are allowed to  sell alcohol do so under licence. As a health professional, I believe that we  need to consider sunbed licensing seriously and be more rigid and strict with  sunbed business owners, because, let us face it, certain individuals will use  the addictive nature of sunbeds and the behaviour of those who use them for  personal profit. If business owners can see a profit, they will exploit  people&rsquo;s addictive behaviour. Incidentally, there is a link between sunbed use  and areas of deprivation. Therefore, sunbed licensing must be looked at very  seriously.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Bill, and I look forward to further debate on  the issue at Committee Stage. We are moving in the right direction. Just  because sunbed legislation has not been introduced in Wales, Scotland  and England,  there is no reason why we should not take the lead. I look forward to further  discussion on the matter.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  I, too, welcome the Sunbeds Bill, which is important and long overdue. In  recent years, the sunbed industry has boomed, with sunbed or tanning salons  opening all over the Province. Sometimes, there is more than one in an area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A tan has become a fashion accessory, and compared with  other tanning products, such as sprays or those that are in bottles, sunbeds  offer people a natural tan. Unfortunately, for many users, sunbeds have become  a habit that threatens their health. Therefore, I welcome the Bill,  particularly because it will ban the use of sunbeds in premises that offer such  services to those under the age of 18. I also welcome the regulation of the  industry. When using a sunbed, people should not be left unsupervised.  Information detailing potential health risks must be provided to all sunbed  users, whether they are purchasing a sunbed for private use or renting it for a  prescribed period within the confines of a business premises. I welcome the  fact that using protective eyewear will be compulsory and that all staff will  have to be trained to operate sunbeds. I also welcome all premises operating  sunbeds for business purposes having to be registered with the relevant  district council, which will have the power to enforce the law on the proper  use of sunbeds as laid down in the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The legislation will bring into effect a strategy to  regulate the operation of sunbeds, and, hopefully, it will help to reduce the  number of cases of skin cancer, which is the most common form of cancer.  However, I have some concerns. Although the Bill is worthy, there is some room  for improvement. Sunbed operators working out of business premises get off too  lightly. Therefore, greater restrictions must be brought in. The Bill offers  basic sunbeds regulation, which, in my opinion, reflects a common sense  approach. Businesses operating sunbeds commercially should already be taking  precautions, and the Department and other agencies should move to restrict the  number of businesses operating sunbeds in any particular area. All sunbed  businesses should operate in licensed premises, and, as a condition of the  licence, all staff should have received a certificate of training.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Given that the Minister banned tobacco advertising, and  given the health risks that are associated with sunbeds, should we also look at  banning sunbed advertising? Perhaps the Minister will comment on that. In many  ways, legislation should reflect the way in which licences are required from  local councils to operate bars, nightclubs and businesses that sell alcohol and  tobacco. When it comes to health, we cannot take risks, so, in the same way  that we have taken precautions with the sale of tobacco and alcohol, we should  learn from past mistakes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We should not take a dim view of the issue, and we should  ensure that our population is protected from the dangers of adverse health  risks. I support the Bill and recommend that all Members do the same. However,  more work is needed. I am concerned that the owners of private sunbeds may not  have the same laws applied to them as those who make a business out of sunbeds.  I call on the Minister to undertake a review of the industry once the Bill  becomes law.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  am not a member of the Health Committee, but I have received communications  from people in my constituency expressing concern about the unregulated use of  sunbeds and the unregulated industry that governs them. Members are often  criticised for not introducing enough legislation. However, that fails to  recognise that good legislation should be measured not in quantity but in  quality, and this is a positive Bill that will make a positive contribution to  the country.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In recent decades, an increasing number of people have  wanted to have a tan. It is a fashionable thing to have. Many people use creams  and sprays, but, recently, more and more people have opted for the sunbed  route, as the artificial UV rays provide a quick and easy way of getting the  tan that they want. However, sunbeds come with a much higher risk than the  alternatives that were used previously.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Startling statistics have been quoted already today. Around  50% of people in the United    Kingdom aged between 18 and 50 have used a  sunbed. As we have heard, a proliferation of tanning studios have popped up and  tanning beds are available in many areas, not just in fitness suites and places  like that, but in obscure places such as ice cream parlours and video shops.  That makes them much more assessable, particularly in deprived areas, and  several Members have talked about that already. Around six million people in  the United Kingdom  use sunbeds every year, and the Bill looks to provide protection and to ensure  that those people understand the risks involved. Good legislation not only  protects everybody and gives them information, it particularly seeks to protect  the most vulnerable in society. We have heard already about younger people.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The industry is self-regulating at the moment, and as we  know from other industries that are self-regulating, it can lead to  difficulties. Problems can be experienced as there may not be adequate safety  and guidance available for customers in the areas where those services are  offered. Mr Deeny referred to coin-operated beds, although I do not think that  there are many of them in Northern    Ireland. However, we have heard some real  horror stories about coin-operated beds in GB, where there is no way of  stopping the very young from using them or of ensuring that people do not use  them for long periods. That, in particular, is very concerning. Perhaps  coin-operated beds should be banned altogether in the UK.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Minister said, between 16% and 20% of the outlets  that have tanning beds are registered with the Sunbed Association, so it is  difficult to determine accurately how many locations there are in Northern Ireland.  We have heard that there are 400 to 500 outlets, and it is difficult to know  the standard of service that is being offered in those locations and the level  of expertise of the individuals who are selling the services.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I listened to Members talk about the potential for  licensing the industry, and that is something that should be looked at. That  discussion will continue at Committee Stage. The Minister might argue and  convince the Committee that it is a timing issue. Nevertheless, it could be  looked at in the longer term so that it does not hold back this legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members have already said that the training that operators  receive and the guidance and advice that they give to those who want to use  sunbeds is often limited. We do not know the level of maintenance carried out  on some of the beds or their level of cleanliness. All that could be made  easier under a licensed system. We need to have regulations on the power and  type of sunbeds and the duration of their use. There must also be warning signs  about the use of sunbeds.<span class="SectionMarker"><em><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></em></span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The lack of regulation in this area was highlighted earlier  in the debate, and it has been highlighted by a number of health and consumer  organisations. I think that they are united in the belief that action should be  taken and that there should be government regulation because of the health  risks associated with exposure to UV radiation. This is consistent with the World  Health Organization&rsquo;s view that the power of the UV rays used in sunbeds is  equivalent to the midday sun in the Mediterranean,  which is a startling fact. In August 2009, the International Agency for  Research on Cancer published a report stating that melanoma has increased by  75% in sunbed users under the age of 30. That highlights the dangers for  everyone who uses sunbeds and for younger people in particular who seek to  obtain the type of tan described as a healthy glow.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Statistics point to the fact that 6% to 10% of 11- to  17-year-olds in the UK  are able to gain access to sunbeds and have been using them. Other Members have  said that sunbed users are generally females who live in socially deprived  areas, which is very concerning. We have seen media reports of children as  young as 14 or 15 going to reputable health clubs and accessing sunbeds with no  questions asked. Indeed, I read a report that the Fitness First chain was  offering its sunbed facilities to 15- and 16-year-olds. It even put posters up  promoting the benefits of sunbed usage, suggesting that the vitamin D derived  from sunbeds is good for the skin and will decrease cholesterol. At best, that  is misleading. It is also highly irresponsible to have that sort of advertising  in those premises, as it gives the impression that sunbeds are totally safe,  which is wrong. Such companies play on the fact that sunbeds are sometimes used  by the medical profession to deal with skin conditions such as psoriasis, and  clause 11 of the Bill refers to the medical use of sunbeds. Earlier, my  colleague Alex Easton mentioned his concern at the advertising of sunbeds, and  clause 7 will prohibit information from being displayed that may mislead the  public. It is important that health club facilities are not allowed to  advertise the perceived benefits of sunbed use.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members have argued that a special case should be made to  ban sunbeds for users who are under 18 years old. That is consistent with what  is happening elsewhere in the UK  and with what has happened elsewhere in Europe and in many states of the USA. However,  as the Chairperson of the Health Committee said, it is also important that  users who are over 18 are aware of the risks and dangers associated with the  use of sunbeds and can make informed decisions. Therefore, I welcome clauses 5  and 6, which will ensure that that information is available to adults who  choose to use sunbeds.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I referred earlier to the need for staff to be adequately  trained, and clause 9 addresses that issue. Furthermore, clause 8 will ensure  that sunbed users must wear protective eyewear when using sunbeds. That is the  case in the rest of the UK,  and Members will have heard the horror stories of serious damage being caused  to eyes and skin as a result of such protection not being offered.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There should be a requirement that the equipment used in  outlets is clean and well maintained. Perhaps that should be a role for  councils. It would be useful if the Minister were to clarify how far councils  could go in that respect. As enforcement will be carried out at council level,  it will be important that they are given appropriate powers and resources to  fully enforce the legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Overall, the Bill is a positive step. I welcome it and look  forward to it progressing through the House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Like other Members I welcome the Bill. It is another strong example of the  Minister&rsquo;s commitment to and passion for addressing health inequalities in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Other Members spoke about the effect of health inequalities  on young people in areas of deprivation and poverty and how that imbalance must  be tackled and addressed. As with many other matters such as drinking and  smoking, the impact on young people is disproportionately bad. Therefore, it is  vital that the Bill bans the use of sunbeds by people who are under the age of  18 and that that is welcomed by all sides of the House.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Excellent points were made about how to make the Bill as  effective as possible, including the proposal to establish a register. It is  important that the Bill goes through the House, is scrutinised by the Committee  and passed by the Assembly to get the regulations and the register in place.  That will provide protection to hundreds of people on the use of sunbeds. As Dr  Deeny and Mr Ross said, although the use of coin-operated sunbeds may be  limited in Northern Ireland,  they could have a serious impact. That issue must be addressed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The servicing and maintenance of sunbeds is a huge issue,  and it is vital that they are fully functioning and operating to the required  standard. I am concerned about the way in which privately owned sunbeds can be  regulated under any system. It is difficult to legislate for events that occur  in the privacy of someone&rsquo;s house.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is an important public health message about the  danger of sunbeds, and, fortunately, the Public Health Agency was established  to deliver such messages. Skin cancer is still regarded as one of the more  treatable forms of cancer, but, unfortunately, some dangers associated with  sunbeds are not always obvious. A public health message must be sent out about  the dangers of skin cancer and sunbeds in commercial and private settings. We  must ensure that that message gets across to the public, and at least we now  have the agency to do so.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is much to welcome in the Bill, and I am delighted  that it is progressing through the House. I fully support it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  As the chairperson of the all-party Assembly group on cancer, which is  concerned by the increase in the number of cases of skin cancer in Northern Ireland,  I welcome the Second Stage of the Sunbeds Bill. Skin cancer is now the most  common cancer in Northern    Ireland, and, although the disease has  several causes, sunbeds are a major culprit. Therefore, the Bill is timely.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A tanned look is regarded as a sign of health and vitality,  and many people, especially young women, have come to regard a sunbed as vital  to getting and keeping a tan. The dangers of sunbeds are well documented. They  can significantly increase the risks of skin cancer, especially among people  who are under the age of 30. The House would be failing in its duty if it were not  to take action to regulate the sunbed industry and to protect the most  vulnerable groups.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The responses to the Department&rsquo;s consultation and evidence  elsewhere show that the public believe strongly that children and young people  need to be protected from the dangers associated with sunbeds. That is why I  welcome the Bill, which broadly follows similar legislation in Scotland, England  and Wales.  By prohibiting the sale and hire of sunbeds to people who are under the age of  18, we will go a long way to protecting young people. The Scottish legislation  prohibits not only the sale and hire of sunbeds to people who are under the age  of 18 but their use. I will be interested to hear the Minister&rsquo;s view on that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Responsibility for enforcement of the Bill will rest with  district councils. Will the Minister advise what additional costings that may  place on councils? Will councils be adequately resourced to undertake the task  that lies before them? Will the Minister advise why the Department is not fully  in favour of licensing for sunbeds? That needs to be examined, and, no doubt,  the Committee will do so during Committee Stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It would be helpful if the proposed legislation could be  augmented by a widespread awareness campaign warning all members of society not  only of the dangers of sunbeds but the dangers of overexposure to the sun. We  have just enjoyed one of the best weekends of sunshine for a long time, and,  undoubtedly, many people took advantage of it and, perhaps, overdid it a  little. However, I was alarmed to hear from radio interviews yesterday that  many people do not feel the need to apply protection when they are out in the  sun here, despite repeated warnings. We must continue to get a message out to  people informing them of the dangers of overexposure to the sun as well as  sunbeds.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The extent of the problem of skin cancer, as we heard from  around the Floor, is so great and radical that action needs to be taken. The  Bill, therefore, is a major step in the right direction. I commend the Minister  for introducing the Bill, and I support it fully.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I am grateful to Members for  letting me know their views, and there will be further opportunities to make  their views known as the Bill moves to Committee Stage. Many of the points that  were made today can be raised again in Committee. The main issue appears to be  licensing. There is a simple reason why I am not opting for licensing at this  time: enough time is not available in this mandate to come forward with  licensing. However, I was anxious to come forward with steps that will make a  difference. We will monitor the situation thereafter, and, if it becomes  obvious that licences are necessary, licensing remains an option for us. We  cannot do it in this Assembly&rsquo;s mandate. If I were to say that the issue is  licensing, the Bill would not progress during the lifetime of this Assembly,  because we do not have the time available.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McDevitt raised the issue of residential use, and I hear  and am sympathetic to his point. However, if someone were to buy a sunbed, take  it home and allow it to be used by members of his or her family and family  friends in the safety and comfort of their homes, it is difficult to see how  any controls could be enforced. I would be interested to hear any suggestions  about how that could be regulated.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The introduction of the Bill was triggered by a report last  year by the Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment. It  allowed us to proceed, and Wales,  England and Scotland are  taking similar steps. Our proposals go further than those of the other  countries, but I am happy to go further again, as necessary, when we determine  that that is exactly where we want to go.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It was suggested that sunbeds be banned, but that would  drive the industry underground. I am not clear about what Dr Deeny meant when  he talked about licensing. He appeared to be talking about licensing sunbeds,  but we, of course, are talking about licensing and regulating premises.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I take the  Minister&rsquo;s point about banning sunbeds. Enormous difficulties and real health issues  would arise if people used them in a black economy. Will the Minister and his  officials explore the idea of introducing the need for licensing by means of  subordinate legislation? I accept his point: his officials made it clear to the  Committee that a window of opportunity has arisen to progress the Bill this  year but there may not be time to introduce full-blown licensing provisions. Is  it possible for the Bill to provide an enabling power to create subordinate  legislation to enable licensing to be introduced at a later stage? If the  Minister did that, the Committee would be more than happy to accept it. It  would be a case of jam tomorrow, but it would mean that we would not have to  introduce new primary legislation and get a slot for it. Dear knows when that  could happen, because, as the Minister knows, he has a heavy legislative  programme, with the Safeguarding Board Bill and, perhaps, legislation on  adoption, among others. It may not be possible to bring in that primary  legislation in the foreseeable future. Is there any way in which the Minister  could consider the subordinate route?</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I am happy to take those points  on board and to pursue the Member&rsquo;s point about an enabling power. If possible,  we will use an enabling power. We have a common purpose: advancing a regulation  and gaining control of the issue. The main purpose of the Bill is to save lives  by reducing cancer caused by sunbed use. That is my priority, and I am open to  any reasonable, practical, workable suggestions. For example, Mr Easton  suggested that advertising needs to be looked at and explored. Using an  enabling power is a useful suggestion, and I will ensure that my officials take  that up.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I look forward to the Committee&rsquo;s deliberations. Once  again, I am grateful to everyone who has contributed to the debate on this  important legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Second Stage of the Sunbeds Bill [NIA 18/09] be  agreed.</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="4"></a>Employment Bill: Consideration Stage</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I call on the Minister for Employment and Learning to move the Consideration  Stage of the Employment Bill.</p>
    <p class="BillAmend-Moved">Moved. &mdash; [The Minister for Employment and Learning  (Sir Reg Empey).]</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Members will have a copy of the Marshalled List of amendments, which details  the order for consideration. The amendments have been grouped for debate in my  provisional grouping of amendments. There are two groups of amendments, and we  will debate the amendments in each group in turn.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The first debate will be on amendment Nos 1, 2, 4 and 6,  which deal with the payment of compensation for financial loss and payment in  respect of training programmes as categorised. The second debate will be on  amendment Nos 3 and 5, which deal with the appointment of members to the Labour  Relations Agency and Construction Industry Training Board, by amending the way  in which the recruitment process is conducted.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I remind Members who intend to speak that, during the  debate on the two groups of amendments, they should address all the amendments  in each group on which they wish to comment. Once the initial debate on each  group is completed, any substantive amendments in the group will be moved  formally as we go through the Bill, and the Question on each will be put  without further debate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Question on clauses stand part will be taken at the  appropriate points in the Bill. If that is clear, we shall proceed. No  amendments have been tabled to clauses 1 to 5. I propose, therefore, by leave  of the Assembly, to group those clauses for the Question on stand part.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Clauses 1 to 5 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  We now come to the first group of amendments for debate. With amendment No 1,  it will be convenient to debate amendment Nos 2, 4 and 6. Amendment No 1  inserts a new clause making provisions for the payment of compensation for  financial loss, and amendment No 6 changes the long title of the Bill. As a  consequence, amendment Nos 2 and 4 change how payments for participation in  employment and training programmes are managed and categorised. I call the  Minister for Employment and Learning, Sir Reg Empey, to move amendment No 1 and  to address all the other amendments in the group.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">New Clause</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning &nbsp;(Sir Reg Empey)</strong>:  I beg to move amendment No 1: After clause 5 insert</p>

    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;to provide for compensation for financial loss in  cases of unlawful underpayment or non-payment;&rdquo;. &mdash; [The Minister for Employment  and Learning &nbsp;(Sir Reg Empey).]</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: Before I speak to the amendment, I will take the  opportunity to thank the members of the Employment and Learning Committee for  their detailed consideration of the Bill. I am grateful for the Committee&rsquo;s  constructive proposals, in particular regarding consultation rights, and I am  glad to say that, with goodwill on all sides, we reached an agreed position.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The amendments that I propose reflect the detailed work  carried out by the Committee, the Office of the Legislative Counsel and my  officials in the Department. I thank everyone involved for their efforts. The  amendments will result in more appropriate consultation with stakeholders,  financial protections for those on training programmes and a simplification of  the process for workers claiming compensation for unlawful deductions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 1 will insert a new clause entitled  &ldquo;Compensation for financial loss&rdquo; into the Employment Bill. It will amend the  Employment Rights (Northern    Ireland) Order 1996 to empower industrial  tribunals to order employers to compensate workers for the full financial loss  that they have sustained as a result of unlawful deductions from wages, which  include failure to pay the national minimum wage and non-payment of redundancy  awards. The amendment will allow workers to bring a combined tribunal claim to  cover breaches of the law in all those areas and claims for compensation for  financial loss that arise from such breaches. At present, workers can obtain  compensation for financial loss only via a separate claim to the civil courts.  The clause will remove the need for claimants to make a separate claim. It is  also designed to encourage employers to make the correct payments in the first  place.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Payments that an industrial tribunal may currently order  the employer to pay or repay are limited to the amount that arises from the  employer&rsquo;s direct liability. That means that financial losses incurred by a  claimant that are over and above the amount that is owed but can be attributed  to the non-payment of unauthorised deductions can be pursued only through the  civil courts. Such losses might include, for instance, charges that are  incurred if a direct debit has failed or punitive interest on bank accounts that  go into the red.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The amendment would allow a tribunal to award not only  compensation to make good an unlawful non-payment or underpayment by an  employer but an appropriate amount to compensate a claimant for any financial  loss suffered as a result of the employer&rsquo;s failure. The proposed changes  contained in the clause will enable those who were wrongly not paid the  national minimum wage to have consequential losses attributable to the  underpayment included in the reward as well.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 6 is a consequential amendment to the long  title of the Bill to provide for the new clause entitled &ldquo;Compensation for  financial loss&rdquo;. Amendment Nos 2 and 4 ensure that people who take part in  departmental employment and training programmes and receive payments in connection  with their participation will have those payments treated as a training  allowance and not as employment income.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The amendments to the Employment Bill will amend the  Employment and Training Act (Northern Ireland)  1950 and the Employment and Training (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order 1988. Those  amendments will ensure that people who take part in departmental employment and  training programmes and receive payments will have those payments treated as a  training allowance and not as employment income. That will ensure that  participants are not liable for tax and national insurance when they take part  in such programmes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At present, primary legislation, namely the 1950 Act and  the 1988 Order, cover only payments that are made to participants by my  Department and do not extend to other payments, for example, travel costs that  are paid to participants by others, such as contracted providers. Therefore,  the proposed amendments will delete the words &ldquo;the Department&rdquo; and insert the  words &ldquo;any person&rdquo; in the 1950 Act and the 1988 Order. Amendment No 2 makes the  appropriate change to the 1950 Act and amendment No 4 changes the 1988 Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Employment and Learning (Mrs D Kelly)</strong>: I welcome the  Consideration Stage of the Employment Bill. The Committee has indicated its  satisfaction with the Department&rsquo;s public consultation process and its  engagement with the Committee both prior to and during the introduction of the  Bill. The Committee is grateful to the Minister and his Department for their  willingness to discuss issues with the Committee and to take its views on  board. I thank Committee staff and stakeholders for their help and support.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Minister has indicated, the purpose of the  Employment Bill is to make provision for the enforcement of legislation  relating to employment agencies and the minimum wage. Additionally, it makes  provision with respect to the membership of and representation before the Industrial Court  and for issues that flow from those provisions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Employment Bill passed its First Stage on 22 June 2009.  The Bill reached its Second Stage on 30 June 2009 and was referred to the  Committee for consideration in accordance with Standing Order 33(1) on 1 July  2009. At its meeting on 16 September, the Committee agreed a draft motion to  extend the Committee Stage of the Bill to 9 November 2009. The motion to extend  was supported by the Assembly on 5 October 2009. At its meeting on 21 October  2009, the Committee agreed that its report on the Bill be printed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the pre-introduction phase of discussion, the Committee  voiced considerable concern regarding proposals around the rights of trade  unions to expel members who have membership of or affiliations to political  parties or groups that hold views not in tune with those of the trade union.  The Minister subsequently decided not to include the proposal in the Employment  Bill as drafted. However, the Committee is aware that that issue must be  resolved, as current law is now in contravention of a European Court of Human  Rights ruling and will have to be amended at some point in the future. The  Committee believes that the issue warrants considerable debate on the Floor of  the Assembly, and it will play a full part in that debate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Other issues raised by the Committee related to the  amendments to the Employment Bill proposed by the Minister. The Committee  initially asked why changes were being proposed regarding the Construction  Industry Training Board, when that body was subject to the outworkings of a  review that recommended its restructuring and merger with the sector skills  council for the construction industry, ConstructionSkills. However, the  Committee has been satisfied by the Department&rsquo;s reassurances that the  legislation to restructure and merge the board is a considerable way off and  the change is needed presently to bring the consultation process regarding  appointments to CITB and the appointments themselves into line with current  practice.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee received correspondence from the Construction  Employers Federation and the Northern Ireland Committee of the Irish Congress  of Trade Unions on changes to the consultation regarding appointment to the  boards of the Labour Relations Agency and the CITB and the process of appointment  itself. The Committee urged the Minister and his officials to engage with  stakeholders and seek compromise, and it facilitated that process. I am pleased  to say that the necessary compromise was reached regarding the Labour Relations  Agency, with further discussion on the CITB deferred.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Additionally, proposed amendments from the Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development that were considered by the Committee were  subsequently deemed controversial, with the potential to slow down the passage  of the Bill. Hence, they are not being brought forward today, and the Committee  is content with that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will now turn to the group 1 amendments, which deal with  financial arrangements. Amendment Nos 1, 2 and 4 are largely technical and  amend existing legislation. The Committee had no issues with those amendments  and is content to accept them. Amendment No 6 amends the long title of the  Bill, and the Committee is content with that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Employment and Learning (Mr Weir)</strong>: I see the  Minister having to duck at this point. As Deputy Chairperson of the Committee,  I commend the Bill and the amendments. It has also been a triumph of process,  because there has been an opportunity for the close co-operation and  involvement of the Department, the Committee and stakeholders to be brought to  proper fruition. As indicated by the Chairperson, that has come from the  pre-consultation stage to the present position as regards amendments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I note in passing the Chairperson&rsquo;s reference to what was  initially covered in the Bill. That included rights of trade unions to expel  members whose views, because of their political background, were not in tune  with those of the trade unions. That provision was obviously dropped from the  Bill, perhaps much to the relief of Declan O&rsquo;Loan, who may otherwise have been  facing its consequence today. That is a sign that there was a good working  relationship and that sensible involvement has been put in place.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee, having looked at the legislation, produced a  very detailed report and worked well with the Department. In looking at where  the Committee felt that there were gaps and inadequacies and in relation to the  amendments, it is good to see that the issues raised during discussions were  taken on board.<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.00 noon</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The amendments enhance the overall thrust of the Bill,  which is particularly relevant at a time of recession and given the career  choices that people are making. We have entered a more flexible situation in  which the likes of employment agencies will be playing a greater role in the  employment of people across Northern    Ireland. That role is likely to increase as  time moves on. There is the short-term issue of the recession. During the  recession, firms may well be looking for people to plug gaps on a short-term  basis, and employment agencies will play a role in that. Furthermore, I am sure  that the Minister would acknowledge that, for the vast majority of people, the  days when someone started in a job at the age of 16 or 18 and remained in that  job or profession until they turned 60 or 65 are behind us. We are in a much  more flexible situation now. Consequently, the role of employment agencies will  be greater, and the purpose of the Bill and the amendments becomes very  important.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is right that the proper protections are put in place  for workers, in particular, and for the agencies themselves. There should not  be anything in the Bill or the amendments for an employer or employment agency  that is behaving in a correct fashion to fear. The legislation is meant to  cover the very small number of unscrupulous employers and those who act in a  detrimental manner that is outside the law.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Minister and the Committee Chairperson indicated,  three out of the four amendments in the first group are, essentially, technical  amendments. Amendment No 1, which inserts new clause 5A, is something that any  sensible person would welcome. If someone has suffered financially because of  their employment in circumstances in which the employer or employment agency is  clearly at fault, it is right that that person is compensated for their full  financial loss. That is fulfilling part of the great tradition of British law,  which looks to see that costs and recompense follow the event. Consequently,  the clause is very much bringing the legislation into line and providing that  degree of additional protection, and it is quite sensible to do that. In a  situation in which someone is suffering loss and it is clearly someone else&rsquo;s  fault, there can be a sense of grievance if there is not proper compensation  for them and proper recovery of that loss. It is right that that provision is  put in place.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 1 and the consequential amendments are a  sensible way forward. The amendments further improve what was already a good  Bill. It is certainly a Bill that I welcome, and I am happy to support it  today.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  welcome the Bill, and, as other Members have done, I commend the Minister and  the Department for their efforts in carrying out a very thorough consultation  as well as meeting stakeholders to come to compromises and agreements.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The make-up of our workforce has changed so much in the  past 15 years that it is timely that we have an up-to-date Bill. We have seen  thousands of migrant workers coming into Northern Ireland to fill our skills  and jobs gaps. Unfortunately, a lot of those workers may have been made  redundant because of the recession. The amendment is very necessary at a time  of recession to protect anybody who has been made redundant or migrant workers  who have wrongful deductions made to their wages. I am sure that many MLAs have  people coming to their offices to make complaints about poor treatment.  Obviously, there are plenty of good employers. However, we have seen a huge  increase of employment agencies in the past few years, and it is important that  those agencies comply with regulations and the law.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I particularly welcome that the trial system will be  changed, meaning that individuals will be prosecuted in the Crown Court as  opposed to the Magistrate&rsquo;s Court, with the result that penalties may,  therefore, be increased. Hopefully, that will stop the illegal operations of  rogue agencies.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I thank the Members who participated in the Consideration  Stage. The amendments prove that legislation can be improved when a Department  and Committee work together. That is, of course, the whole purpose of the  legislative process. Whenever a Department suggests proposals and a Minister  introduces legislation, it is good that they have a well-informed sounding  board in the form of a Committee that can work with stakeholders and take the  time to test some of the propositions in that forum. That process shows up  weaknesses in proposed legislation from time to time. Such work has, therefore,  improved the technical aspects of this Bill, as well as the long-term  objectives that we are seeking to achieve. As has been said, it is clear that a  few issues caused a bit of concern among some of the stakeholders, and we tried  to address those systematically as we went along. I think that we have  succeeded, in large measure, in achieving that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson of the Committee mentioned the European  dimension to the legislation. Obviously, we have run into section 75 issues in Northern Ireland,  and those must be paid attention to. However, those issues may be addressed  subsequently if the opportunity arises to link the legislation into Westminster legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Weir&rsquo;s points about the recession were absolutely right.  Circumstances have changed, and the pattern of employment that people expect no  longer exists. Some people will have to be upskilled and retrained many times,  but I think that we all accept that. Anno Lo pointed out that there has been a  big increase in the number of agencies. Although the sector is made up, by and  large, of people who conduct their business properly, some people have not  conducted themselves appropriately and have tried to exploit others. However,  that is another issue, and I suspect that it will not be the last. Indeed, the  House has made several attempts over the past few years to try to address some  of those issues. However, vigilance will be required in the years ahead.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If the economy picks up, and I hope that it will do so  soon, there will be more opportunities for more people to go into business. All  sectors have the good, the bad and the ugly. Our job is not to penalise those  who are doing a good job and running a good business. Rather, our job is to  protect individuals from exploitation and to ensure that the labour market  operates as efficiently and effectively as possible. That is in the long-term  interest of the economy. The Bill is not designed to overburden people who are  trying to do business. However, people have been exploited, and it is our task  to ensure that that does not happen.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I believe that the amendments on compensation for financial  loss make worthwhile improvements. If people suffer as a result of being  underpaid, it is only appropriate that they should receive adequate  compensation. We wish to ensure that people who have suffered losses unjustly  are compensated and that people who take part in departmental programmes do not  suffer detriment because of their participation in them. That is why wanted to  ensure that allowances are paid and that they are treated as training  allowances and not as income. I think that most Members will welcome that.</p>

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  We come now to the second group of amendments. With amendment No 3, it will be  convenient to debate amendment No 5.

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: Amendment No 3 relates to consultation rights with  CITB ConstructionSkills Northern Ireland. Amendment No 5 relates to  similar consultation rights in relation to public appointments to the Labour Relations  Agency. These amendments will clarify provisions in the Industrial Training (Northern Ireland) Order 1984 and the Industrial  Relations (Northern Ireland)  Order 1992 in relation to the requirements to consult organisations  representative of employers and employees when making appointments to the  boards of public bodies, namely the Labour Relations Agency and CITB  ConstructionSkills Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Last year, it became clear that there was some ambiguity  around what form that consultation should take. It is important that that  consultation does not compromise my responsibilities under the ministerial code  or the code of practice that was published by the Commissioner for Public  Appointments for Northern    Ireland. Therefore, I wish to clarify that  consultation will take place on the arrangements for public appointments only,  such as the essential criteria that candidates must satisfy or the ways in  which the Department raises awareness of vacancies.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My officials have discussed these amendments at length with  the Committee for Employment and Learning and interested parties, in  particular, the Northern Ireland Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade  Unions. Those discussions were designed to ensure that the views of key  stakeholders are taken into account appropriately during the process of  appointing members to those two important boards. I understand that  stakeholders are content with amendment Nos 3 and 5.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Employment and Learning</strong>: The Committee had some concerns  with amendment No 3, which details appointments to the Construction Industry  Training Board, with regard to changes being made prior to the completion of  the reorganisation of that body and its merger with ConstructionSkills. The  Committee questioned the rationale of making changes to CITB before details on  the merger were brought to the Committee. The Department indicated that the  legislation regarding the restructuring of the CITB and its merger with  ConstructionSkills will take some time and that it is moving to use the Bill to  regularise appointments to CITB. The Committee accepted the Department&rsquo;s  reasoning for that move.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Concerns were raised by the Construction Employers  Federation and the Northern Ireland Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade  Unions around changes to consultation regarding appointments and appointment to  the board of CITB. The Committee encouraged the Department to talk to those key  stakeholders and to reach a compromise. However, the Department has indicated  that any changes to the appointment process will be discussed as part of the  merger process. The Committee accepted that and is, therefore, content with  amendment No 3.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When looking at public appointments, the Minister should  look at where there is a shortfall, among young people and women in particular,  in relation to the criteria and essential skills, which must be set in a way  that does not disadvantage sections of our community.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee received concerns from stakeholders about  amendment No 5, which details appointments to the Labour Relations Agency,  similar to those voiced regarding amendment No 3. The Committee urged the  Department to discuss the issues with the important stakeholders, and a  compromise was reached. The Northern Ireland Committee of the Irish Congress of  Trade Unions and employer organisations&rsquo; representatives will sit on the  interview panels for appointments to the board of the agency.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That compromise will also apply to appointments to the Industrial Court.  The Committee is delighted to have facilitated that compromise and is content  with the amendment, as indicated in the Bill report.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  support both amendments, which are the result of constructive dialogue between  the Committee, the Department and a couple of key stakeholders. Through the  amendments, we have managed to tease out a situation that everyone can, broadly  speaking, buy into.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am not sure whether the Chairperson&rsquo;s comment about  public appointments was a late bid for a place on one of the boards. She said  there was a shortfall among women and young people. She would qualify as a  member of at least one of those groups, although I am not so sure about the  second one.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The amendments bring a degree of clarity and certainty to  the situation, but allow a degree of flexibility in the appointment process.  There is a realisation, particularly with the reorganisation of the CITB, that  there will be a need for a certain amount of work to be done before the new  formats can fully be brought to fruition. It is important that there is flexibility,  and the amendments give the certainty of consultation while allowing an  opportunity for flexibility in the outcomes. That also ensures that, if there  is a need for interim positions, that will be covered.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 5 addresses appointments to the board of the  Labour Relations Agency. Again, the stakeholders seem to have been brought on board  in the formulation of that amendment. The amendment brings appointments to the  agency&rsquo;s board much closer to the criteria used for public appointments. That  provides a degree of flexibility in the composition of the board and the  breakdown of its nine members, which makes sense. I support amendment Nos 3 and  5.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I want to say a few words about the  Bill. The Minister and the Chairperson of the Committee have outlined the  purpose of the Employment Bill. Members&rsquo; comments have shown that questions  were raised during the Bill&rsquo;s passage. Throughout the process, there was  goodwill and good work from the Committee, the Department and the stakeholders.  Collectively, we were able to work on the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to place on record my thanks to the Committee staff  for their help, support and guidance to the Committee throughout the Bill&rsquo;s  passage. We are quite keen to criticise when it is appropriate, but one of the  key points to place on record is that the Minister and his officials have been  quite open and honest, and have shown a willingness to work in proper  partnership with the Committee and the stakeholders from the beginning of the  Bill&rsquo;s passage. We should highlight that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is not controversial, and we are not criticising  each other in the debate owing to the partnership approach that was adopted.  That shows that we are taking collective responsibility and that we are,  possibly, being adults and are looking at the Bill from a different  perspective. I also place on record my thanks to the stakeholders. Again, the  Bill has shown that outside stakeholders can play a positive part in the  process and make a big difference. Involving those stakeholders shows that we  are being relevant to the people outside and are listening to them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A number of concerns have been raised by the stakeholders,  especially the trade unions. From previous discussions, we know that when we  get more information and facts, we are able to see the outworkings. In this  case, the concerns were about the Construction Industry Training Board, and we  were given reassurances. The Minister and his officials should be commended for  their genuine open-door policy. When I was Chairperson of the Committee, the  Minister said that he was willing to listen to and work in partnership with the  Committee. He did listen to the stakeholders.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 5 shows a willingness by the Minister and his  officials to listen to concerns from stakeholders and the unions. Concerns are  not necessarily criticisms but, if they are not heard, they can become  criticisms.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Again, a clear message was sent out that the Department,  officials, Committee and stakeholders could move forward, and a compromise was  reached. Genuine partnership and everyone&rsquo;s willingness to get round a table  and deal with the matter before it became an issue produced a positive outcome.  I support the Bill and the amendments.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>:  I will speak on the group 2 amendments, which are designed to clarify the  nature of the consultation that the Department is required to undertake when  making appointments to the Construction Industry Training Board and the Labour  Relations Agency.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is vital that all public appointments be made according  to the highest standards of integrity. For that reason, the ministerial code  requires Ministers to act at all times within the confines of the seven  principles of public life. There is no mechanism to test the ministerial code.  We simply have to trust a Minister who is accused of breaking the code and hope  that an investigation started by the same Minister is independent and can be  trusted. It is refreshing, therefore, for a Minister to come to the House,  state that something may compromise his responsibilities under the ministerial  code and lay before Members his idea of how to fix the problem.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment Nos 3 and 5 resolve the problem. They remove the  possibility of those two boards being consulted on the basis of named individuals.  They require the Minister to consult representatives of employers and employees  on structural elements of the appointments process at a much earlier stage.  That is a much more satisfactory way to deal with public appointments, in that  it provides a further guarantee that the best person for the job will be  appointed, without any handshakes or tacit understandings. It is a good way to  solidify the principle that the best person should get the job.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I congratulate the Minister on excluding amendments  relating to the Agricultural Wages Board. That board represents nothing more  than an unnecessary bureaucratic burden on the agriculture industry, and I  welcome the fact that the Minister stood firm. I congratulate the Minister on  the Bill, which has received broad support in the House and among stakeholders.  I thank the Committee staff for all their help and guidance in bringing us to  Consideration Stage.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: The lesson to be learned is that the Department  and the Committee seem to be getting too lovey-dovey. The system does not work  for every Department and every Committee, but it is, nevertheless, something in  which I believe, and the evidence from today is that the system works.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Committees and Departments do not have to be continuously  at war. They are there to help each other. Both exist to improve the quality of  the legislation, improve the development of policy and to scrutinise and hold  to account, as and when required. Over the past few years, they have demonstrated  that they are perfectly capable of doing so.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will resist the temptation to get involved in the  argument about who is suitable for appointment. At this stage, I will quit when  I am ahead. I am content with the amendments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question that Amendment No 3 be made, put and agreed  to.</p>

    <p class="H4StageHeading">Forestry Bill: Final Stage</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development (Ms Gildernew)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Forestry Bill [NIA 11/08] do now pass.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I am  delighted that the Forestry Bill has reached its Final Stage. I firmly believe  that it is a good and modern piece of legislation that has been developed in  the spirit of co-operation. It is not easy to get it exactly right for  everyone, but we have a responsibility to strike the best balance possible.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is more than 50 years since the last Forestry Act and,  who knows, perhaps this Bill will have to last for the same length of time.  That is why I wanted the Bill to be subject to intense scrutiny by the  Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development and stakeholders. I am glad  that that is exactly what happened. With the help of the Committee for  Agriculture and Rural Development and the wide range of stakeholders who  contributed to the development of the Bill, I believe that we have struck the  right balance and that the Bill was developed in the spirit of co-operation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Forestry Bill will retain powers to deal with  day-to-day forestry matters and to protect trees from damage by wild animals  and from fire risk from vegetation on adjoining land. There will still be  powers to make by-laws to ensure safe and responsible enjoyment of the public  forest estate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The original visions and principles of the Bill remain  intact: sustainable management of all our forests that support the timber  industry; expansion of forest cover in the North of Ireland; protection of  public and private woodland from damage; provision of the necessary powers to  enable the full potential of forests to deliver social, economic and  environmental benefits to be realised; and new provisions to enable the  commercial opportunities that are provided by forests to be optimised.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I formally thank the Chairperson, Deputy Chairperson and  members of the Committee for their extensive consideration of the Bill. I  acknowledge the volume of work that the Committee has done on the Bill and the  publication of its comprehensive report. Its constructive and detailed work has  brought the Bill to where it is today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee suggested a number of important amendments,  which have provided multifaceted forestry legislation that is capable of  supporting a modern and forward-looking strategy. The Bill will give the powers  to deliver a wide and integrated spectrum of social, recreational,  environmental and economic benefit. Traditional timber production, with its  important role in providing employment in the primary and ancillary sectors,  will continue. However, our forests will also offer the potential to be  utilised for a wide range of creative initiatives, which we will help to  realise by engaging with partners across the public, private and community  sectors.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is an example of how a Minister, Department and  Committee, working together on legislation, can achieve a positive outcome and  produce a robust and significant piece of legislation. I look forward to  continuing productive work with the Committee during its consideration of two  other Bills, on the welfare of animals and dog control, which I hope to  introduce to the Assembly next year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also pay tribute to the wide spectrum of stakeholders for  working with me and my officials on the Bill, and for their constructive  comments and advice. Their contribution of time and effort has assisted greatly  in developing this multifaceted piece of primary legislation. Their advice and  contributions in developing legislation such as the Forestry Bill is absolutely  crucial to ensure that the vital role that forestry has to play in mitigating  climate change and the vision of doubling forest cover in the North of Ireland  over the next 50 years will be supported by the powers in the Bill. We also  wish to preserve our environmental heritage as a legacy for generations to  come. The Bill will also promote sustainable forestry.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, I thank officials in the Office of the First  Minister and deputy First Minister, the Office of the Legislative Counsel, the  Departmental Solicitor&rsquo;s Office and the Bill Office, who have given much  support and advice along the way. I also thank the Committee Clerk and his  staff for their support and commitment during the process, and my departmental  officials, including the chief executive of the Forest Service and his  colleagues, who have worked very hard on the Bill to achieve such a good  outcome.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development (Mr Elliott)</strong>:  I thank the Minister for securing the Bill&rsquo;s passage thus far and apologise on  behalf of the Chairperson of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural  Development, who is participating in duties in another place. No one can ever  say that the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development is not divided. We  are specifically divided today in that a number of Committee members are in  this place, and a number are in another place. Perhaps a number of them should  be in another place again, but I do not want to complicate matters.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">From the outset, the Committee was at one with the  Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in recognising the fact that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  existing forestry legislation is out of date. We differed, however, on the  thrust of the proposed Bill as presented to the Assembly. The Committee was of  the view that the proposed Bill was retrospective, narrow and not forward  thinking. The Committee firmly believed that an opportunity existed for dynamic  new forestry legislation that would truly exploit the vast potential of the  forestry estate in Northern    Ireland and provide the framework to help to  realise that potential. The Committee recognises the benefits of forests and  woodlands to the local economy, recreation, tourism, the environment and rural  and urban local communities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee took evidence from a wide range of  stakeholders who held a variety of interests in the forestry sector. We used  that evidence to propose a number of significant amendments, including those  relating to the Department&rsquo;s duty on forestry; the compulsory acquisition of  land; the development of a woodland inventory; the control of animals; the land  adjacent to forests; and the fees for felling licences. I am pleased to say  that the Department and the Forest Service were broadly, although not entirely,  receptive to the Committee&rsquo;s amendments. That approach has resulted in  effective, strategic and forward-looking legislation. The Committee hopes that  such an approach will be taken to the forthcoming legislation to which the  Minister referred.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Forest Service&rsquo;s commitment to producing  delivery plans that will translate the duties placed on it into actions on the  ground. Those delivery plans will allow for a strategic approach to the use of  forests. They will also ensure that the role of forests in wider land  management, such as flood management, species conservation, water quality  improvement and mitigation of climate change, is com&shy;municated to local  communities, stakeholders and Departments so that the value of woodland and  forests can be included in proactive decision-making and planning. The plans  will be subject to the scrutiny of the Committee, which will have the  opportunity to undertake its statutory obligations on policy development.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Another politician and supporter of agriculture, J Sterling  Morton, the founder of Arbor Day in the United States, once said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The cultivation of trees is the cultivation of the  good, the beautiful, and the ennobling in man.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Committee looks forward to the Department  delivering on the Programme for Government target for the significant expansion  of woodland in Northern    Ireland, particularly in the private sector.  With the amendments that were sought by the Committee and agreed by the  Minister and the Department, we have dynamic and strategic legislation that  will allow the Department and the Forest Service to move forward in the  development of woodland across Northern    Ireland for the benefit of the entire  community. The legislation will truly stand the test of time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Forest Service in Northern Ireland was once held up  as an example of innovative forest management. The Committee looks forward to  our forests and woodland being utilised and developed in an innovative,  sustainable and proactive way.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for Agriculture and  Rural Development, I thank Committee members, the departmental Bill team and  its supporting officials, those who gave evidence to the Committee and the  Committee&rsquo;s support team for their time and effort in getting us to the stage  that we are at today. The Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development  commends the Forestry Bill to the House and recommends that it be passed.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Irwin</strong>: I  welcome the opportunity to comment on the Bill as it nears the end of its  legislative journey. As I have said in previous debates on the issue, Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  forests are a much-valued part of the landscape and heritage of the Province.  The many parks and plantings provide a great source of amenity space for  thousands of people each year. Our tourist industry also benefits greatly from  the various accessible and well-known forest parks in the Province.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In creating this legislation, the Department wishes to  update and to respond to changes that have taken place since the last piece of  forestry legislation was introduced over 50 years ago. It is important that the  devolved Administration is seen to respond to changing requirements and to  legislate for such changes in the interests, in this case, of our woodland  resources. The Bill is a reflection of that and, over time, it will ensure an  overall improvement of the condition of our forests to the betterment of  everyone.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Bill shows, our forest industry is more than just a  reserve of timber. As the importance of leisure and amenity space grows, so  does public use of forest parks. Likewise, as environmental issues gain  prominence, the importance of maintaining forests and increasing tree cover grows.  As I have said in previous debates about amenity space, a whole lot more could  be done to expand and improve the current amenity facilities in forest parks,  particularly with regard to the camping and caravanning fraternities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In a local context, my council, Armagh District Council,  has been proactive and undertook to improve facilities such as Clare Glen, a  relatively small woodland area, and, as a result, has received about 1,200  bookings in the past year alone for it. That proves to me that with the right  kind of facilities and management, the potential for improving more established  sites is clear.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased that the Agriculture Committee played a full  part in the legislative process and as a member of that Committee, I was  encouraged to see that a full range of stakeholders was consulted. It is  impossible to meet the exact requirements of all the interested bodies, but the  Bill satisfies the concerns of the majority of stakeholders. There are nine  forest parks in Northern    Ireland that require substantial  maintenance, monitoring and management. As there are more than 100 other sites  with varying levels of amenities, the need for up-to-date legislation is  obvious. The Forest Service is responsible for more than 76,000 hectares, which  is a considerable undertaking.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A section of the Bill refers to the traditional function of  the development of afforestation, but forest cover in Northern Ireland  is currently around 6%. I have previously raised some concerns in the Assembly  about how the Department can increase the percentage of forest cover, given the  complex nature of our small landmass and our ever-increasing need for  productive farmland. It will be a complex task, as the area of suitable land  available and population density are factors in setting targets for increasing  woodland cover. In the case of Northern    Ireland, given the spread of rural dwellings  and the small in size but large in number distribution of our farm holdings,  the scope for large-scale afforestation is reduced in comparison with some other  countries. However, that is a challenge that the Department has to face.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister is on record as saying that the legislation  will effectively support:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;a modern and forward-looking strategy. It will give  the powers to deliver a wide and integrated spectrum of social, recreational,  environmental and economic benefits.&rdquo; [Official Report, Vol 51, No 2, p62, col  2].</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I hope that, following Royal Assent, the Department  will begin quickly to deliver on the commitments given and we will see change  where change is due, so that our forest reserves are improved and managed for  the future.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank everybody as well.  Everybody is in thankful mode, so I will join in.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When the Bill is enacted, forests will have to be  multifunctional. They will need to be relevant to all our lives. More people  must be able to use them recreationally, and to earn a living from them,  forests will need to be developed to provide for energy needs. As the Minister  said, when granted Royal Assent, the Bill will become the first Forestry Act in  over 50 years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The legislation will deliver forestry management that is  fit for purpose in an ever-changing world. The Bill has been the piece of  legislation that I have most enjoyed being involved in, which shows the sad  life that I lead. What made it so interesting was the fact that it covered so  many sectors and aspects of life. The range of stakeholders was diverse, and I  thoroughly enjoyed working on it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Forestry for rural development is, I suppose, what the  Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development is all about. There is a great  opportunity for rural dwellers to make an income from forestry through  recreation, tourism or renewable energy projects. There is also a big  opportunity for communities to benefit economically from tourism projects close  to large tourism towns. In addition, there are a great number of opportunities  to develop tourism in areas where it is not utilised.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are environmental and conservational aspects to the  Forestry Bill. It is a marvellous piece of work that, as the Minister said, is  the result of people working closely to produce a Bill that is fit for purpose.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As was mentioned during Committee Stage, we must remain  mindful that all stakeholders need to get round the table regularly over the  years, as we try to develop the strategies in the Bill. It is OK to have the  Bill and its strategies, but we must implement them. We need to keep updating  those strategies and moving them forward to ensure that everybody benefits. I  repeat that I see great opportunities for renewable energy and for general  economic regeneration, particularly in recreation and tourism.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am conscious that I have to get back to a Committee  meeting. However, in finishing, I will touch on some parochial politics. Will  the Minister update Members on the mountain biking proposals for Castlewellan  and Rostrevor in south Down? Will she also give the time frame for delivering  the high ropes project in Tollymore, which has been granted planning  permission?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This is about devolution. It is about us shaping our  society, regardless of whether we come from a unionist, nationalist or other  perspective. We are coming together and showing a bit of maturity. For too  long, we have seen politicians not getting a lot of heavy pressure. However,  the Bill is something on which we have all worked together for the benefit of  the people and for the North of Ireland. I commend everybody involved in that  process. This sort of co-operation, with people getting on and doing business,  is not seen on television screens. Negativity is usually seen. I am glad to  have played my part in the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  I thank the Minister for introducing the Final Stage of the Forestry Bill. On  behalf of the SDLP, I also thank members and officials of the Committee and all  who contributed to the Bill. It may be considered too late in the day, but I  wish to raise two points. As Willie Clarke pointed out, it is important to have  ongoing negotiations and to look at the Bill as it develops, after its  enactment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Part 4 of the Bill covers the public right of access to,  and by-laws for, forestry land. Clause 30(1) bestows the statutory right of  pedestrian access to all forestry land, which I welcome. I also note that such  access must be for recreational purposes. Not having been a member of the  Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development at the time, I was absent for a  considerable amount of the Committee&rsquo;s debates on the Forestry Bill. Therefore,  I am not aware of everything that was discussed in Committee. Will the Minister  inform me of her Department&rsquo;s definition of &ldquo;recreation&rdquo; as referred to in the  Bill? Is there a list defining which activities are considered to be lawful and  those that are considered to be unlawful? I pose the question simply because  one person&rsquo;s definition of recreation may differ from those of others or from  that of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. I am thinking of  the likes of badger-baiting, snaring and shooting, which may go on in forests.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My second question relates to the appeals process. If an  appellant makes a successful appeal, regardless of the issue, can the Minister  overturn the decision? That has happened in the single farm payment process,  and it causes me some concern.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the comments of the Minister and the Members who  spoke before me, and, despite a few reservations, I welcome the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  The Alliance Party is happy to join with others in giving its support to this  Final Stage. We also pay tribute to the work of the Department and the  Committee in finalising the details of the Bill. We recognise that the Bill is  a major achievement in that it is the first major piece of forestry legislation  in this jurisdiction for 57 years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, this is a day that is tinged with a certain degree  of sadness. Members will, no doubt, know very well Patrick Cregg from the  Woodland Trust, who has campaigned for new legislation in Northern Ireland  for many years, and he has lobbied the Department and the Committee on the  matter. His wife recently passed away and was buried this morning. I am sure  that Members will wish to reflect on that, on Patrick&rsquo;s contribution as part of  the Woodland Trust and on the work of the Royal Society for the Protection of  Birds in pushing for this legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have today legislation that reflects a new era. We have  moved away from simply viewing forests as a natural resource for commercial  exploitation towards a new way of looking at them. We should also recognise the  economic aspects of timber and that forests mean much more to society through,  for example, environmental heritage, the conservation of fauna and flora,  leisure and recreation and the tourist potential that arises from that. At the  same time, we should recognise that forests make our contribution towards  tackling climate change more effective.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is very good. It is not quite perfect, but it is  probably about 95%, 96% or 97% of the way. A few areas could have been slightly  tighter than is the case, and we tried to tease out those issues through  amendments. Sadly, those amendments did not find favour, but that is the nature  of the democratic process. No doubt, however, when future policymakers come to  look at this issue, some aspects of the debates that we have had in the Chamber  over the past number of months may serve as a useful starting point.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is an ongoing challenge for the Department in  ensuring that we meet our targets for increasing forestry cover in Northern Ireland.  It is worth stressing that our cover is still much less than that elsewhere in  these islands, never mind elsewhere in Europe.  The landscape here is, generally speaking, treeless, and if we compare that  with the landscape in the eastern United States, where canopies of  trees surround most small towns and villages, the contrast is very stark and  points to a different way of doing things. However, there are challenging  targets. It is important that we measure how we are getting along and that all  concerned make the best efforts to ensure that we get to where we want to go.  Generally speaking, we are very happy with the legislation, and we are happy to  support its Final Stage.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Doherty</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Originally, I did not intend to  speak here today, but I felt absolutely compelled by the speech of the Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development, Tom  Elliott, to say a few words.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I endorse everything that the Minister said about the way  in which we collectively approached the Bill. I also endorse 99% of what the  Committee&rsquo;s Deputy Chairperson, Tom Elliott, said. The 1% is because, despite  the best efforts of the Deputy Chairperson and our fellow Committee member Jim  Shannon to get me to go to Westminster for the Queen&rsquo;s Speech, I had a clear  choice: I could either have gone to Westminster to hear the Queen speaking  today or I could have stayed here to hear the speech of the queen of  agriculture and rural development. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> The  choice for me was quite simple: I chose the latter.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>:  In Northern Ireland,  forestry is a big industry, and, interestingly, the Forest Service is one of  the biggest landowners. Importantly, the legislation will bring the forestry industry  into the twenty-first century. Since initial discussions on the Bill began in  the Agriculture Committee, I have pushed the idea of opening up forests for  leisure pursuits, such as horse-riding, with the proviso &mdash; it is a big proviso  &mdash; that rules and regulations are adhered to. Those using forests must observe  the code of conduct. People have various ideas about how to spend their leisure  time, and opening up our forests will be one way to help them to alleviate  stress and utilise that time. The Bill affords us an opportunity to bring the  Forest Service into the twenty-first century, and it can only do good for the  community.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann  Comhairle. First, I thank Members for their contributions to the debate, which  has been encouraging because it shows, without doubt, the level of lively and  passionate interest in our woodlands. We all recognise that sustainable  forestry is a compelling imperative.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am satisfied that the Bill strikes the right balance, and  that feeling was reflected in the comments of the Deputy Chairperson and other  Members. The Bill will present an appropriate range of powers to enable us to  take forward our various forestry objectives, including the protection of  forests, both public and private; the expansion of forest cover; the continued  support for the vital role played by the timber industry; the realisation of  the full potential of forests to deliver social, recreational, economic and  environmental benefits; and the optimisation of the commercial opportunities  that forests provide.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members raised a number of issues, but they recognise that  the Bill will result in multifaceted forestry legislation that is capable of  supporting a modern and forward-looking strategy. It will give powers to  deliver a wide and integrated spectrum of social, recreational, economic and  environmental benefits. In addition, the Bill encompasses the important role  that traditional timber production plays in providing rural employment in the  primary and ancillary sector. That role will continue. Furthermore, our forests  offer the potential to be utilised for a wide range of creative initiatives,  which we will help to realise by engaging with partners across the public,  private and community sectors.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Willie Clarke referred to the role of forests in mitigating  climate change, and the Bill outlines a clear duty on my Department to promote  forest expansion and sustainable forestry. The Bill refers specifically to  developing forests for:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the mitigation of, or adaptation to, climate change.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That will be achieved principally through our  programme to double forest cover, which will be supported by grants and  incentives. We will also encourage the growing of energy crops, such as short  rotation coppice, which absorb carbon, and we will plant trees that can adapt  to a changing climate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many Members, including Stephen Farry, spoke about  expanding forest cover, and we recognise that we have challenging targets. We  plan to double forest cover &mdash; from 6% to 12% &mdash; over a 50-year period, and that  must be achieved primarily through the afforestation of privately owned  agricultural land, which will be supported by funds made available under the  rural development programme. In our strategy, we acknowledged that landowners&rsquo;  commitment to farming means that, at first, forests will expand slowly. The  Programme for Government target reflects the fact that there will be a slow  initial expansion of woodland. However, after that, our targets will need to  increase if we are to achieve our long-term aim.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We will encourage a wide range of forest types, which will  improve the environment, enhance the landscape and support rural development  and the production of renewable energy. Additional support is available to  encourage new woodland in areas that have the potential to offer public access  and value for informal recreation.<span class="SectionMarker"><em><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></em></span></p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Forest Service&rsquo;s recently published strategy to develop the  recreational and social use of our forests is taking forward specific proposals  to identify partnership or opportunities with private and public sector  organisations, including local councils, to improve the quality and range of recreation  provision that is available in our forests. We expect that to result in  improved facilities and the creation of new recreation opportunities, such as  treetop adventure activities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Willie Clarke asked about the Go Ape proposals for  Tollymore Forest Park. The planning issues have been dealt with, and we are  negotiating terms of lease with the operating partner for the installation.  Those negotiations are aimed at securing opportunities for subsequent  development on other sites following the installation at the Tollymore site,  which, I hope, will be in place for the summer season, since we missed the  Easter deadline. We have been working closely with the councils in the south  Down area to resolve issues over leasing arrangements for mountain-biking  facilities, and I am confident that we can move those issues forward quickly to  secure the necessary funding. People accept that the more activities we have in  our forests, the more attractive they will be as recreational venues for new  and existing visitors, and they will contribute to the tourism agenda for the  North.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am not sure where Mr P J Bradley goes for recreation, but  badger-baiting is not part of forest recreation. I am sure that he recognises  that there is no legal definition of recreation in the Bill, but everyone is  fairly clear about the type of recreation involved, which will include  mountain-biking, orienteering etc.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is great potential for our forests to contribute to  tourism, particularly in rural areas where the tourism product might be lesser  than in our towns. It has been estimated that our forests receive over 2  million visits annually, with the resulting benefits to the local economy.  Forest Service has been liaising closely with the Tourist Board and other  stakeholders to consider how the tourist potential of our key forest sites can  be maximised. Forest Service is also working with the Strategic Investment  Board to identify further potential for commercial and recreational development  in forests, and I will ensure that that work continues. We have been  considering our forestry grants, which will continue to be made available  through the rural development programme to assist the expansion of woodland and  to encourage the sustainable management of existing woods.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Today&rsquo;s debate has been good. It is great to see the  conclusion of the Forestry Bill and to know that another piece of legislation  has been taken care of. As I said in my opening remarks, there are two other  pieces of legislation coming up, and I hope that they can be dealt with with  the same partnership approach that we have adopted to date. I recognise the  Committee&rsquo;s work in scrutinising the Bills. We have had a good working relationship,  and I look forward to that continuing. I am confident that the powers in the  Forestry Bill will address my Department&rsquo;s contemporary and evolving  commercial, environmental and social objectives for forestry and will allow us  to obtain better value from the forest estate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>

    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="6"></a>Private Members&rsquo; Business</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Preschool Places</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30  minutes for the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes to  propose the motion and 10 minutes in which to make a winding-up speech. All  other Members who are called to speak will have five minutes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly acknowledges the grave disappointment and  financial hardship faced by many parents who have been unable to secure  preschool places for their children; recognises the disparity between the  number of applications and the number of preschool places; and calls on the Minister  of Education and the Executive to examine urgently the number and distribution  of nursery school places and to bring forward proposals to ensure that each  child receives a preschool place in the year immediately before starting  school.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Caithfidh m&eacute; a  r&aacute; go bhfuil &aacute;thas orm p&aacute;irt a ghlacadh sa d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht th&aacute;bhachtach seo faoin  r&eacute;amhoideachas. I am pleased to move the motion on preschool places. The  shortage of places that led to the motion being tabled was addressed, in the  interim, by the Minister&rsquo;s provision of &pound;1&middot;3 million last week. That provision  is welcome, but it does not make today&rsquo;s debate any less relevant. Many issues  relating to preschool education must be addressed. Despite attention having been  drawn to those issues on more than one occasion and in several important  reports, that has not yet happened.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister will, undoubtedly, tell the House that those  issues will be addressed in the draft early years strategy for nought to  six-year olds. We have been waiting for that strategy for the past six years,  but it has still not been published, and, unsurprisingly, people are beginning  to wonder whether it ever will be. Yesterday, the Minister told the House that  the draft strategy would be released shortly. We have heard that story time and  again, but we have still not seen it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Last week, the Minister alleviated the recent shortage of  1,200 preschool places. That shortage cannot be put down to a mere blip in the  statistics. Rather, it suggests that the Minister&rsquo;s planning is out of sync  with the population trends. For some time, the Minister has been telling the  House that the school-going population is falling and that schools will have to  close. Now we learn, however, that she misjudged the number of preschool places  by 1,200. How much faith can we have in the predictions of a Department that is  so far out in its planning? The hole has been plugged for this year, but one  wonders what next year and future years hold in store. Do the Minister and her  Department know?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is almost a year-on-year problem with matching the  number, demand and distribution of preschool places. That must be addressed  once and for all, so that all children in their immediate preschool year obtain  the place to which they are entitled. The Department has made that promise, and  I look forward to hearing how the Minister intends to address the problem.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I would also like to hear what actions the Minister is  taking to address the issues raised by the ETI and Audit Office reports on  preschool education. The reports detail, for example, the disparity between  accommodation and access to resources and describe how such disparity adversely  affects the effectiveness of provision. In that respect, provision is best in  the statutory nurseries, but lessens through nursery class to the voluntary and  community sector. Regardless of what the Minister may say, the quality of accommodation  strongly influences the quality of provision. The problem requires urgent  attention.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The capacity for effective self-evaluation and  self-improvement, which is also strongest in the statutory sector but lessens  through the other sectors, must also increase. Time and again, the Minister has  told the House that, in accordance with her policy, Every School a Good School,  reflection, self-evaluation and self-improvement are key elements in raising  standards. That is one of the Minister&rsquo;s key themes. That is another area of  preschool education that must be urgently addressed if we are to bring about  the improvement in standards which the Minister says is a priority in her  policy and which, according to some reports, is required in some areas of the  sector.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Education and Training Inspectorate report highlights  the need for an improvement in the specialist advice and support available to  staff. Once again, that is particularly relevant to the voluntary and community  sectors and, indeed, the private sector. The statutory sector has easy access  to a range of Curriculum Advisory and Support Service (CASS) support, from  curriculum support to support with psychological services. The voluntary,  community and private sectors do not have the same ease of access, and I hope  that when the nought-to-six strategy is published that issue will be a  priority.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Previously, the House debated the need for a transformation  fund to ensure that qualifications are equalised across the preschool sector. A  professional development framework should be developed to equalise  qualifications. To maximise the benefit of preschool education to our children,  we need the most highly qualified workforce possible. The better qualified the  workforce, the greater the benefit to children, the more they will derive from  the experience of preschool education and the longer the positive effect of  that experience throughout their lives. There is no good reason why staff in  community and voluntary preschools should not have opportunities to develop  professionally their qualifications on a par with those in other parts of the  sector.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Audit Office report highlights the unequal funding  levels, which, it says, contribute to unnecessary and unhelpful qualitative  differences and perceptions of status between providers and limit the potential  benefits to children. The report says that a more flexible approach is needed  through the creation of further viable voluntary and private preschool centres.  Much remains to be done in special educational needs; there is a need for more  resources, training and backup, especially in the voluntary and private sectors  but also in a third of the statutory sector.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The inspectorate reports identify issues of collaboration  between education, health and social security agencies. I expect that that  theme will be taken up in the nought-to-six strategy. Better communication and  co-operation is needed between the statutory sector and the voluntary,  community and private sectors. Co-operation and communication between those  sectors needs to be improved. As I said, the voluntary, community and private  sectors have issues around qualifications, funding, accommodation, support and  the provision of advice. The statutory sector often feels taken for granted  and, sometimes, even ignored when it comes to formal or informal consultations,  as it does not have the professional, full-time advocacy support on which the  voluntary and community sectors can draw.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is much to be gained from better communication and  co-operation between the statutory and voluntary sectors. Each has its  strengths, and each could benefit from a greater sharing of experience. That  could be achieved through a standing committee or by joint conferences. The  Department should ensure that all sectors are heard and listened to during  formal or informal consultations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go n-&eacute;istfidh an tAire leis an m&eacute;id at&aacute; le r&aacute;  agam anseo inniu agus go dtabharfaidh s&iacute; freagra ar na point&iacute; t&aacute;bhachtacha at&aacute;  ardaithe agam.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that the Minister has heard the important points  that I have raised and that she will address them and indicate how the  nought-to-six strategy will respond to them.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education (Mr Storey)</strong>: I rise as the Chairperson of  the Committee for Education to inform the House of some of the information on  preschool education that the Committee has received over the past year or so.  It is the Committee&rsquo;s intention to scrutinise the funding of preschool  education as part of its scrutiny of the Department&rsquo;s early years nought-to-six  strategy. However, as the proposer of the motion has informed the House, we  wait, we wait and we wait. To date, we have no date in relation to the  publication of the nought-to-six strategy. It is regrettable that we have been  waiting for six years on a nought-to-six strategy, but I will come back to that  in a moment or two, when I will speak in my capacity as a Member.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department&rsquo;s preschool education expansion programme  has received almost &pound;58 million since 1998, and it has approximately 21,000  funded places with, we are told, over 90% availability of places for children  in their final preschool year. There are 14,000 places in nursery schools or in  nursery classes in primary schools and approximately 6,600 funded places in  voluntary and private preschool education centres. To complicate things  further, there are an additional 600 places in reception classes and groups.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Recently, the Committee asked the Department for  information on the unavailability of nursery provision in certain areas, with  an analysis across the education and library boards of the effects of social  disadvantage, the age-related admissions criteria and the incidence of places  being oversubscribed or undersubscribed and places filled by children who are  not old enough to enter primary schools the following September. I note the  comments in the Minister&rsquo;s press release from last Thursday, when she announced  an extra &pound;1&middot;3 million for 2010-11. She said that the extra money was for:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;an unprecedented shortage of around 1,200 pre-school  places.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I am interested to know what proportion of the &pound;1&middot;3  million is expected to go to nursery classes and schools as opposed to  voluntary, private preschool centres and how many places will be created in  each sector. Perhaps the Minister will inform the House of those figures. Will  she also give the House a definitive date for the publication of the draft  early years nought-to-six strategy?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although preschool education is a non-compulsory phase of  education, it has important potential benefits. The Committee will be  interested to ensure that quality preschool education is provided with the  limited resources available. I look forward to reporting back to the House on  that on another occasion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will speak now as a Member and not as the Chairperson of  the Education Committee. It is suspicious and unhelpful that the Education  Minister has made a decision to make an announcement that is clearly divorced  from the policy that we have been awaiting for the past six years. If, as the  Minister tries to tell us, legislates for and lectures others on, there has to  be equality and equity in how sectors are treated, then, surely, serious  questions are being asked, particularly in the statutory sector. What provision  is being made? It is a sector that does not have teaching principal time  release and feels that it is being treated unfairly. However, the Minister  makes an announcement which in no way delineates or explains how that &pound;1&middot;3  million is going to be given out. Therefore, I ask the Minister to give the  House, for the first time, answers to our questions. I know that she will have  her script from which she will not deviate and will sit and sign ministerial  papers and talk to her colleagues during the debate, but we would like her to  give answers on the issue, because many parents have been contacting our  constituency offices about the unavailability of places.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The proposer of the motion referred to the ETI report. We  still have no idea what the Department will do with regard to that report. How  will the Department respond to it? How will it deal with the issues?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member draw his remarks to a close?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: We want answers, not the usual rhetoric  that we have come to expect from the Minister.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I will start by congratulating the  Minister on securing, in these difficult financial times, &pound;1&middot;3 million for  preschool places. Other Ministers who come into the Chamber tell us what they  cannot and will not do. However, Members from the opposite Benches and Members  to my left, physically rather than politically &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: Declan O&rsquo;Loan would not say that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  do not want to get into the North Antrim  stuff.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members from the opposite Benches and Members to my left,  physically rather than politically, continually lambaste the Education  Minister, claiming that she has no answers. However, she has 1&middot;3 million  answers to this one, and she has provided, in these very difficult  circumstances, a much-needed resource to the community.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Dominic Bradley said that we do not know what is going to  happen next year. I agree with him: no one knows what the budgetary constraints  will be next year, and no one knows the exact number of applications for  preschool places until those applications come in. However, it is clear that  preschool places are very popular with parents. They are a useful and  beneficial educational resource, and we should encourage the funding of those  places and extra resources for those places into the future.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: Does the Member agree that there is a  contradiction if he is advocating the funding of private places in the nursery  sector, given his party&rsquo;s view on the funding of another sector, namely prep  schools, which, according to him, are private education? What is the  difference?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member has an extra minute to speak.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Even with the extra minute, I am not sure whether the Member who asked the  question could fully rationalise what the question is about. You cannot equate  preschool places with prep school places, where parents are asked to spend up  to &pound;3,000 to fund their children and, in some of the private school places that  he referred to, parents are asked to make a contribution of &pound;20 a week. That is  some difference, so the equation that the Member is making does not work. Or  perhaps the Member is suggesting that we should stop funding community groups  that provide preschool places. If that is what the Member is suggesting, he  should come out and say it. Personally, I do not think that that is the way  forward, because I believe that the community and voluntary sector offers a  valuable contribution to education through the provision of preschool places.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will move on to the Member&rsquo;s final remarks, when he was  speaking as a Member rather than as Chairperson. He said that he has no answers  to any questions, but surely that is the role of the Education Committee, of  which the Member is Chairperson. If the Chairperson of the Education Committee  does not know what questions to ask, is that the fault of the Department of  Education, the fault of the Minister, or the fault of the Member? I suggest  that it is the fault of the Member.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: As Chairperson of the Education Committee,  I will give the Member all the questions that have been asked and all the  answers that we are still awaiting. For six years, we have been waiting for a  nought-to-six strategy. Why? It is a simple question, which needs a simple  answer. The Minister cannot even give it to us today.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  thank the Member for his intervention. I know that time passes slowly sometimes  in politics, but I have only been here for three years, since May 2007. We  welcome the hope that the early years strategy will be published. However, as I  have said before to the Member in relation to policy decisions, I do not want  just any decisions or any answer; I want the right decision and the right  answer. I want the right strategy for early years education because, as Mr  Bradley said, we want to ensure that whatever is planned for the future allows  for a secure and robust education system, which starts with early years  education and allows us to educate our future workforce. That is what this  debate is about.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, I welcome the fact that money has been invested. I  hope that there will be continued funding of this system, and I think that some  of the Departments, parties and their Ministers could learn something. Instead  of coming to the Chamber telling us what they cannot do, perhaps sometime they  will tell us what they can do.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: As Question Time commences at 3.00 pm, I suggest that the House  take its ease until that time. The debate will continue after Question Time,  when the next Member to speak will be Mr Basil McCrea.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The debate stood suspended.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I inform Members that the question for urgent oral answer that was  scheduled for 3.30 pm has been withdrawn.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H1Heading"><a name="7"></a>Oral Answers to Questions</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H2DepartmentHeading">Justice</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Prison Officers: Cultural Diversity Training</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">1. <strong>Mr  McElduff </strong>asked the Minister of Justice to outline the nature and extent of  any cultural diversity training provided for prison officers. (AQO 1299/10<a name="AQO1299/10" id="AQO1299/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice (Mr Ford)</strong>: Enhancing diversity is a key aim in taking forward the  development of the Prison Service. The service has a comprehensive diversity  strategy, which has won plaudits. The service has adopted a comprehensive  approach to meeting its cultural diversity training needs. All prison officers  have received equality and diversity awareness training, and a more detailed  diversity training package is being rolled out to all staff. In addition, all  training programmes for prison officers include cultural and diversity aspects,  and have a core focus on respect.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The training complements and supports the diversity  strategy Make a Difference, which was launched in 2008. The package sets  diversity within the prison context and explores the need for staff to  recognise and respect difference. It explains how individuals can instinctively  act in a manner that reflects prejudices and an inherent ability to stereotype.  It encourages staff to lead by example by setting the appropriate standard of  behaviour and encouraging others to show due consideration and respect. It  considers how language can impact on individuals.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The training also provides examples of how to approach  those issues sensitively. The themes have been mainstreamed into the wider  training programme, helping staff to explore the impact of cultural and  diversity issues and approaches in their routine activities and to learn to adopt  the approach that is appropriate for the specific circumstances. The Prison  Service recognises the historical imbalance in the composition of its workforce  and there is some way to go to create an organisation that fully reflects the  community that it serves. However, the steps that have been taken aim to ensure  that, in the interim, existing staff address the needs of inmates and visitors  as individuals and with respect for their background.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  answer and for detailing the type of training that all prison staff should be  aware of and involved in. Is there a level of resistance in the Prison  Officers&rsquo; Association to such cultural diversity training? I am mindful of my party  colleague&rsquo;s visit to Maghaberry prison last week. Will the Minister update the  Assembly on the worrying situation inside Maghaberry prison at this time, where  some prisoners are accusing prison officers of not respecting their human  rights?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I thank the Member for his supplementary question, though I fear  the second part of it goes a bit beyond where he started. The diversity  training is a mandatory part of the training of all prison officers, and is  being rolled out as a corporate training priority and is, therefore,  compulsory. It is a permanent module in all new entrant training courses in  which entrants are required to demonstrate their competence through a written  assessment, and it is included in the induction for all newly promoted staff.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I suspect that there are many aspects of training in the  public sector and in private industry that attract a degree of resistance in  different ways at different times, but the Prison Service management is  entirely committed to ensuring that that diversity training is carried through.  So far, nearly 1,000 staff, including many managers, have had specific  diversity training. The plan is to continue to roll it out progressively.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The current issues in the prison about how individuals are  being dealt with by prison officers demonstrate a throwback to the potential  difficulties that could arise if we resumed the circumstances from 20 or 30  years ago. I believe that the Prison Service management, with some support from  all elements, whether from prisoners or from prison staff, is showing that  those difficulties can be overcome.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  Does the Minister believe that the training represents value for money, and  will he outline how he sees it benefiting society?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I certainly believe that all training of prison officers to ensure  that they deal in an appropriate way in respecting the backgrounds and cultures  of all prisoners is absolutely essential if we are to progress towards a more  normal society and build a shared future in which each individual can be  respected. We cannot suggest that certain aspects of training do not represent  value for money if they are seeking to build the different kind of society that  we so urgently need.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Given the obvious necessity for diversity training in the Prison Service, does  the Minister believe that his time would be better spent developing radical  proposals to address the obvious and serious lack of community balance in the  make-up of the staff of the Prison Service?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: The Member raises an interesting point. However, in a week when we  are hearing about financial opportunities, we need to recognise that there will  not be a Patten-style reform of the Prison Service. There was an extensive  redundancy programme with the closure of the Maze prison and a run-down of the  staff numbers required. Indeed, 40% of prison staff left at that time. There  are limited opportunities for recruitment because of that. At this stage, I  believe that it is appropriate to ensure that all staff are trained  appropriately in issues such as diversity, which I have just spoken about, and  to recognise that, as we seek to recruit the rather smaller numbers in future,  we will see that groups are fully represented as they apply. There has been  some progress to date in ensuring that there are applications from  under-represented groups.</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Crime: Reporting</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">2. <strong>Mr  Bresland </strong>asked the Minister of Justice what action he is taking to  encourage the public to report crime. (AQO 1300/10<a name="AQO1300/10" id="AQO1300/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Justice</strong>:  I thank the Member for his question. The most recent survey on the experience  of crime highlights a range of reasons why the public do not report crime. To  address that, there needs to be a concerted approach by all levels in the  criminal justice system, working together with the wider community, to  encourage the public to report crime. Therefore, at regional level, I welcome  the initiative in the 2010-13 policing plan to increase the proportion of  crimes reported to the police to 50% by March 2011. My Department is committed  to working in partnership with the Police Service and the Policing Board to  achieve that target. In addition, through the funding of Crimestoppers, my Department  ensures that a mechanism is in place that allows the public to pass on  information in confidence. My Department also supports a range of initiatives  to address particular areas of under-reporting of crime by encouraging victims  in those groupings to come forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At local level, communities need to play their part. They  have a vital role to play in the reporting of all crimes. Devolution of  policing and justice allows all parts of the community to engage with the  police to report crime and suspicious activity as we work towards building  safer communities for everyone.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bresland</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer. He has partly answered my supplementary  question. There were dissident republican attacks in Strabane over the weekend.  Does the Minister agree that it is the duty of all citizens to report crime,  co-operate fully with the police and encourage anyone with any knowledge of  those attacks to do the same?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I do not think that the Member will be surprised to hear me say  that I encourage anyone who has knowledge of any crime to ensure that they  co-operate in the best way possible with the Police Service and ensure that the  community as a whole acts to make Northern Ireland a safer place, regardless of  the kind of crime that has occurred.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that the lack of appropriate responses to repeat  offending discourages members of the public from responding to criminal  incidents and from reporting crime? How is he contacting the various limbs of  the criminal justice system so that each looks carefully at the issue so that public  confidence is maintained, accurate records are obtained, and issues of a repeat  offending nature that are of concern to the public are dealt with?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I thank the Member for that question. Repeat offending is a  serious issue in society. Indeed, the need for a comprehensive cross-cutting  approach to reducing offending is included in the Hillsborough Castle  Agreement, and reducing repeat offending is a large part of that. Issues have  shown that there is a need to ensure that the justice system operates more  speedily, that the various agencies co-operate and that, in particular, there  is appropriate use of community penalties, including probation at an early  stage. There is clear evidence that such measures can reduce repeat offending  if applied appropriately and speedily. First, we need to ensure that we stop  people entering the criminal justice process, and, secondly, we need to remove  people at an early stage before they become what are generally regarded as  hardened criminals.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. What support can the Minister  offer to vulnerable witnesses to encourage them to come forward, especially  those who are under threat from paramilitary organisations?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: Supporting victims and other witnesses to ensure that they give  full evidence is a major issue. Particular methods are used for witnesses to  the most serious crimes. However, it is important to ensure that a culture of  lawfulness is built up and that the assumption among the community, as a whole,  is that we will all work together to reduce crime and to assist the criminal  justice agencies.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In light of the arrangements that we have here, given that  justice powers have been devolved, it is also important to ensure that we  develop a system that means that people have the confidence to work together.  That will not be easy, and in the case of particular crimes, it will be quite  difficult for some time. However, maximum effort must be expended to ensure  that the community works together.</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Security</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">3. <strong>Mr  McNarry </strong>asked the Minister of Justice for his assessment of the current  security situation. (AQO 1301/10<a name="AQO1301/10" id="AQO1301/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: The level of threat remains severe. The Chief Constable has  responded with a targeted increase in activity in recent weeks, and he  continues to ensure that increasing numbers of officers are deployed to front  line duties. I take this opportunity to thank the public for their co-operation  with, and support for, the police over recent weeks. The Chief Constable and I  recognise the inconvenience that is sometimes caused to the community. The  threat to our community comes from groups that oppose the democratic  arrangements here and that seek to undermine the political progress that people  have demonstrated, over and over again, that they want. Those groups do not  have public support. They cannot win elections, and they do not even try to.  Instead, their objective is to make everyone a loser by attacking communities  such as those in Newtownhamilton.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members will be aware that garda officers arrested two men  on Saturday as part of an ongoing investigation into dissident activity. One of  the men appeared in court in Dublin today after  being charged with explosives offences in Dundalk.  I will, therefore, not speak about the detail of that case. However, it is an  excellent example of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI working well together.  Yesterday, I spoke to the Irish Justice Minister, Dermot Ahern, and I asked him  to pass on my congratulations to the Garda Commissioner for the good work that  is being done on the southern side of the border. Clear signs exist that the  fullest co-operation is taking place between the two police services on the  ground. I trust that the entire House will welcome that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer. I note the tone of his reply and his use  of the word &ldquo;severe&rdquo; to describe the security threat. Would the Minister  support the Chief Constable in calling for counterterrorist police officers for  Great Britain  or a limited Army presence?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: That would be a decision for the Chief Constable to make on the  basis of his assessment. After assessing the present situation, he moved police  officers from back-office duties to front line duties. He is, therefore,  capable of dealing with the present risk. As part of our efforts to ensure the  best possible community policing service in Northern Ireland, that position  should be supported. If the Chief Constable requires additional resources, such  as financial support, he has the right, through the Policing Board, to seek  them. However, at the moment, no assessment has been made of the necessity to  involve military support.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Although the Justice Department can provide resources to support the police in  pursuing those who are intent on inflicting damage on our society, what actions  is the Minister taking to persuade his Executive colleagues of the need to  support other policies that the Assembly can take forward to try to win the  hearts and minds of the people who are being led astray and into terrorism by  evil forces in society?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I thank my colleague for his usual percipient question. Real  issues exist that cannot be dealt with solely by the agencies responsible to  the Department of Justice. There is a real need to ensure that the Executive  take a joined-up approach to the issue, that a variety of different agencies,  such as community safety partnerships, co-operate locally, and that Members in  this Building concentrate on building a shared future to increase people&rsquo;s  confidence, to build safer communities across every part of Northern Ireland  and to ensure that, together, we deal with the threats that we face.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  The official record will show that, on the previous occasion on which the  Minister was here, I asked precisely the same question as Mr McNarry has just  asked.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Did you get the same answer?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  The official record will show whether I got the same answer. However, I accept  that the security situation changes daily.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McNarry asked the Minister whether he would support the  Chief Constable in calling for whatever measures he deemed necessary. I noted  that the Minister studiously avoided answering that question. Therefore, I put  it to him again: can the Chief Constable depend entirely on the Minister&rsquo;s  support for any measures that he deems necessary to combat the dissident  threat?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: In my initial comments, I thought that I said that the question of  the resources required is entirely a matter for the Chief Constable. During my  previous appearance, in responding to the Chairperson of the Committee for  Justice, I made it clear that I would support any reasonable request put  forward by the Chief Constable, as long as he argues his case, to put in place  the necessary measures required to deal with the threat. That cannot be  extended to include what the Member thinks may be required. However, I assure  him that I have already supported requests from the Chief Constable, and, when  there is a good, cogent, well-argued case for additional resources to support  the policing effort, I will continue to do so.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as  an fhreagra sin.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister agree that, at the point of transfer, and  ever since, the Chief Constable has stated publicly that he has more than  adequate resources to deal with all aspects of policing as it pertains to the  North?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: The prospect of coming between the Chairperson and Deputy  Chairperson of the Justice Committee is a dangerous one. However, I agree with  the way in which Mr McCartney phrased the question. Lord Morrow phrased his  question somewhat differently.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Chief Constable told me that he has adequate manpower.  However, he said that he has sought additional resources for equipment, such as  IT, and, at times, for overtime payments. However, that is not the same as his  saying that he requires a significant change to the way in which the security  situation is managed. The Chief Constable has not sought anything beyond the  normal resources that any police service might seek in any part of the country.</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Inspire Women&rsquo;s Project</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">4. <strong>Mr B  McCrea </strong>asked the Minister of Justice what progress has been made in  relation to female offending as a result of the Inspire Women&rsquo;s Project. (AQO  1302/10<a name="AQO1302/10" id="AQO1302/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: The Inspire Women&rsquo;s Project is a pilot service that was  established to develop and deliver a new and enhanced range of women-specific  services. It contributes directly to reducing women&rsquo;s offending through  targeting community-based interventions. The project addresses the complex and  multiple needs of that group of women by helping them to re-establish  themselves in the community and by assisting in the reintegration of women who  are leaving custody. Since starting in late 2008, the project&rsquo;s average  caseload of 150 has comprised women from the greater Belfast area. The project has delivered a  range of gender-specific programmes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A key feature of the Inspire Women&rsquo;s Project is its strong  connection with local community-based women&rsquo;s groups. Its staff work in close  partnership with those groups to link women offenders, many of whom have broken  relationships with family and community, with local support and resources.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although much has been achieved over the past 18 months,  and my visit to the project was truly inspiring, it remains a pilot project. An  evaluation is scheduled to be completed later this year, and, therefore, it is  too early to assess the project&rsquo;s impact on women&rsquo;s offending.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Perhaps that was a less sensitive political hot potato than the previous  question. Given the Minister&rsquo;s background in social work, I am interested in  his personal observations about the Inspire Women&rsquo;s Project and whether he  thinks that anything further could be done to change offending behaviour among  women. That would make Northern Ireland  a much safer place to live.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I am not sure whether I should be flattered by that description.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member referred to making Northern Ireland safer. We must  recognise that the circumstances of women&rsquo;s offending tend to be different from  the circumstances of men&rsquo;s offending. The problems associated with female  offending are frequently complex and involve poverty, homelessness, mental  illness, abuse, domestic violence and addictions. There is no doubt that those  problems are many of the motivators for women&rsquo;s involvement in crime.  Similarly, the age profile of women offenders tends to be different from that  of male offenders.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To reduce women&rsquo;s offending and reoffending and to create  the safer society that the Member referred to, we need to develop appropriate  support mechanisms to address those multiple needs outside the custodial  sanction where possible.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Naturally, as one who previously made his living as a  social worker, I was inspired &mdash; to repeat the pun &mdash; by the work of fellow  social workers in the Probation Service to prevent their clients from  re-engaging in crime and to assist in the resettlement, in a small number of  cases, of women who leave Ash House in Hydebank Wood Prison. I was inspired by  the project. It is early days to make a formal assessment, but I was deeply  impressed by what I saw on my visit.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  Does the Minister have evidence to suggest that women are more likely than men  to get custodial sentences? Does he have any concerns about that issue?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: There is only one answer that I can give to that question: I will  write to the Member.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>:  Will the Minister join me in welcoming the work on young women offenders by the  youth conferencing scheme and by the Youth Justice Agency through  community-based services, such as the Towers project in my constituency of  Strangford? The Towers project not only ensures that a direct apology is made  to the victim, but it makes sure that reparations to victims are agreed. That  has a proven track record of success in reducing reoffending by women.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: This afternoon&rsquo;s Question Time is almost becoming a social  workers&rsquo; outing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member knows that I would support any initiative that  has a measure of restorative justice along with various aspects of reparations  being made in a way that encourages offenders to engage with their victims,  where the victims are willing for that to happen. Such initiatives tend to have  a fairly good effect on reducing reoffending, particularly for younger people  who might otherwise be in the early stages of a criminal career.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The important issue is that we learn the lessons of  projects and do slightly different things in Northern Ireland so that we can  have best practice in reducing crime overall.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Electronic Tagging</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">5. <strong>Ms N&iacute;  Chuil&iacute;n </strong>asked the Minister of Justice how many people have been  electronically tagged as part of their bail conditions over the last year. (AQO  1303/10<a name="AQO1303/10" id="AQO1303/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: The courts imposed 550 electronic monitoring orders as a condition  of bail between 1 April 2009 and 31 March of this year: 449 adults and 101  juveniles.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A curfew with an electronic monitoring requirement can be  imposed by the courts as a condition of bail, community sentence or  post-custody licence. Electronic tagging is used to monitor an individual&rsquo;s  compliance with the curfew and has been available to the courts since 1 April  2009.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his response. The figures are alarming. First, has  there been an increase in the past year? Secondly, do the Minister and his  Department have any plans, through the community safety partnerships vis-&agrave;-vis  district policing partnerships, to work with communities so that they, too,  know the bail conditions of people who are tagged? Tagging does not always  work, and people need to know the bail conditions of those who are tagged so  that they can give any relevant information to the PSNI.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I thank the Member for her questions. The real issues are the  opportunities that electronic tagging provides. It is not a sort of GPS system  that provides satellite tracking; it is merely a system that enables the  monitoring of curfews in cases where people are confined to their homes at  particular times of the day as part of their bail requirements. We need to be careful  that we do not expect electronic tagging to do more than it can. However, there  is no doubt that where individuals have agreed to be tagged, it has played a  useful role in monitoring curfews. How we deal with other potential breaches of  bail conditions is beyond the ability of an electronic tag.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>:  The Minister told us that 515 people have been tagged. How many of those 515  have broken the conditions of their tagging, and what future steps might the  Minister be able to take using new technology to provide more safety for the  community?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: Just to clarify: it may be the way that I speak, but I said that  there were 550 orders in the first year, not 515. The issue of breaches of  curfews does not necessarily relate solely to the equipment. Indeed, the issue  of breaches of bail conditions generally may well involve rather more than just  a specific curfew requirement or an indication that a tag is responding in a  particular way. Therefore, it is not possible at this point to separate out the  question of curfew breaches from other breaches of bail conditions.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question 6 has been withdrawn.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Criminal Justice</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">7. <strong>Mr  Savage </strong>asked the Minister of Justice what action he has taken, or intends  to take, to reduce avoidable delays in the criminal justice system. (AQO  1305/10<a name="AQO1305/10" id="AQO1305/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: Speeding up justice by tackling avoidable delays in the criminal  justice system is one of my key priorities. I have already met the Criminal  Justice Board, which is driving a new programme of work on delays, and I asked  for that work to be accelerated. The new programme will focus on case  preparation, case management, youth cases and governance. I have asked for an  urgent report on the plans to eradicate unnecessary delays and thereby deliver  a better service, especially to victims.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>: I  am aware that the Minister is committed to tackling avoidable delays in the  system. Will he provide an update on the number of requests for further  information between the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) and the PSNI? What has  been done to reduce the number of requests?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: It is not my role to know the precise detail of how those numbers  operate. What we are determined to do through the work of the Criminal Justice  Board is to see that the interface between the Police Service and the Public  Prosecution Service is smooth, so that additional information is required less  and less, and the best possible service is provided in the papers that are  provided by the Police Service to the PPS.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There may also be the opportunity to increase discretion  within the Police Service on minor crimes, to avoid clogging up the entire  process with relatively minor issues. However, that has to be decided in  greater detail later. The important issue is that all parts of the criminal  justice system learn that they have to operate together to provide the  speediest possible justice for the benefit of victims, for the benefit of  witnesses and, ultimately, for the benefit of criminals, too.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I always believed that people were innocent until proven guilty. Has the  Minister had any meetings with Criminal Justice Inspection, or will he seek its  views, given its expert analysis of the avoidable delays in the system?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I, too, tend to believe that people are innocent until proven  guilty. I am not quite sure what the point of that was.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have met Dr Michael Maguire, the Chief Inspector of  Criminal Justice. I discussed with him in general terms his work programme,  which includes references to issues such as the speed of justice and  co-ordination between other agencies. There is a clear opportunity to use the  skills and expertise that the inspectorate has put into some of its work for  the Criminal Justice Board to take forward the process of speeding up the  justice system.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Does the Minister recognise that avoidable delays occur particularly among  young people?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: Yes. It is absolutely clear that where young people are involved  in criminal activity and face considerable time before they reach the courts or  a youth conferencing arrangement, there can be major problems in their  potentially getting further involved in crime. In some cases, those who are  immature do not connect the eventual outcome with the crime that they  committed.<span class="SectionMarker"><em><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></em></span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It is vital that, for young people in particular,  the criminal justice system is speeded up as quickly as possible, and that work  stream is being worked on.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind Members that the question for urgent oral answer has been  withdrawn.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="8"></a>Private Members&rsquo; Business</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Preschool Places</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Debate resumed on motion:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That this Assembly acknowledges the grave  disappointment and financial hardship faced by many parents who have been  unable to secure preschool places for their children; recognises the disparity  between the number of applications and the number of preschool places; and  calls on the Minister of Education and the Executive to examine urgently the  number and distribution of nursery school places and to bring forward proposals  to ensure that each child receives a preschool place in the year immediately  before starting school. &mdash; [Mr D Bradley.]</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  It is always difficult to rejoin the debate after Question Time. For Members&rsquo;  benefit, I will explain that an analysis of effective preschool provision was  carried out in some detail in a longitudinal study that started in 1998. The  survey found that benefits from preschool education run all the way through to  Key Stage 1; formal training tends to benefit cognitive development better,  whereas playschools tend to be best for social development; it makes no  difference whether provision is full-time or part-time because both are equally  effective; and children with disadvantage gain most from settings that involve  other children with mixed abilities and from mixed backgrounds. Other Members  pointed out that the quality of staff training, and the quality of staff, leads  to a marked improvement in outcomes for children. The study is quite  comprehensive in that regard.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In an exchange with Mr O&rsquo;Dowd, I heard the Chairperson of  the Committee for Education talk about who can do what, who has done the most,  and so on. However, we must deal with the fact that some 1,200 preschool places  are vacant. We do not know whether the &pound;1&middot;3 million that the Minister found  will satisfy that demand. Parents feel a gross sense of injustice when they  discover that they cannot get their children into a nursery school within an  appropriate distance. A constituent of mine failed to get her child into one of  four nursery schools by a distance of 800 m. The distance criterion is an  issue. Perversely, that constituent is a primary-school teacher, and if she had  wanted to put her child into the school in which she taught in Newtownards, it  would have been possible. The result is a most unfair postcode lottery that  disadvantages people in a ridiculous way.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When Mr O&rsquo;Dowd spoke triumphantly about finding &pound;1&middot;3  million, he ignored the fact that we do not have our nought-to-six strategy,  which would have informed all our discussions. I will put that in perspective:  a child who was born six years ago would by now have left the cohort that the  nought-to-six strategy would have covered. We managed to go through that entire  period without developing a proper strategy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a tendency in these debates, when we have all been  given excellent briefings, to regurgitate other Members&rsquo; contributions and say  that someone ought to do something. I want to ask the Minister a number of  specific questions that, perhaps, she will address, because the populace are  anxious to hear the answers. Will the money that she has found reduce  completely the overhang of 1,200 places? How many people will be unable to find  a place? Would she consider it appropriate for her Department to amend its  current policy of funding 90% of places to funding 98% of places? The  development of a long-term policy should ensure that all people, in all  reasonable cases, should have access to preschool or nursery school places for  their children.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I understand that the Department&rsquo;s policy is that a place  is available for a child within the education and library board area in which  he or she lives, even though that place may be 30 miles away. It is ridiculous  that young children are expected to travel such a distance. Perhaps the  Department would consider the introduction of an access criterion of, perhaps,  five miles. Will the Minister give an undertaking in that regard?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am aware that time is against my developing these themes,  but there is an issue around resolving the different types of preschool  education that we have. Maybe we have to look at reception classes or at the  age at which compulsory education starts. However, if we are going to do so, we  must address the issues properly. We must have proper, fully funded preschool  education in the way that Finland  has. I am trying to indicate that we on this side of the House are willing to  engage with the Minister provided that she engages with us. It is high time  that she did so.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: I  support the motion, but I also acknowledge the announcement made by the  Minister on 20 May about an extra &pound;1&middot;3 million of funding. I cannot help but  observe that, as usual, the Minister appears to be damned if she does and  damned if she does not. To me, that announcement was good news, but other  Members think otherwise.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister explain how we have moved from having  surplus places to having a shortfall of 1,200 places? I appreciate that the  estimation of demand is not an exact science, but demographic trends and birth  rates can be accurately assessed. There are clear indications of the reduction  in the birth rate trend being reversed, with implications for preschool and  primary school provision.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Our system is supposed to guarantee a preschool place for  all children whose parents request one. It is largely the case that places are  offered, but this year the system has been under strain. I could give details  of several cases in my area in which children were offered places a long  distance away. For example, one Dunmurry resident was offered a place in  Dromara, which is 20 miles away, and a Lisburn resident was advised to take a  place in west Belfast, which is not so far away but which was probably not what  that person was looking for.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Again, I recognise the Minister&rsquo;s action in funding extra  places in private sector nursery units this year. I hope that she will clarify  that position, because my understanding of her announcement is that the money is  going to the private sector to provide more places. It seems that parents will  be largely satisfied between now and the start of term in September.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Public Accounts Committee recently expressed concern  about the practice of allowing underage children to take up surplus places  funded by the Department. I believe that around &pound;10 million has been spent on  funding those places. Surely it is important to ensure that children of the  correct age and qualification are not disadvantaged by that apparent loophole.  I have heard anecdotally of underage children being accepted before normal  demand has been satisfied.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There should be a clearer link between the information  available at a local level and preschool provision within a locality. We could  draw on information held by local councils and health professionals that might  help to alleviate bottlenecks in the future. Offers to children in their  penultimate preschool year should be considered only when all those in their  final preschool year have been placed. I suggest that no two-year-old should be  placed until at least 30 June.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I note the Department&rsquo;s view, which was confirmed in the  written answer to a question tabled by Naomi Long on 12 January 2010, that all  nursery providers give priority to children in their final preschool year,  regardless of the preference that they have stated, and that those children  should be given preference over underage children who may have ranked the unit  as their first preference. That is fine for individual units, but it may mean that  a more area-based approach is required and that all children in the area who  are in their final preschool year should have priority. It should not be too  difficult to establish co-operation among nursery units in a given area. That  would have eased the problems in the Lisburn area and in other areas this year.  That said, I feel that this year&rsquo;s problems will be sorted out with the help of  the voluntary sector and the Minister&rsquo;s extra funding. Nonetheless, I support  the expression of concern as stated in the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hilditch</strong>:  I apologise for dipping in and out of the debate. Once again, the Committee for  Social Development is sitting this afternoon to discuss a number of issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Like most Members, I have been contacted, through my  constituency office, by several parents whose sons and daughters have been  unable to secure nursery school placements in their area because of the  criteria being set by the boards.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not want to get into more figures, because all sorts  of mileages have been mentioned. However, the North Eastern Education and  Library Board advised one lady from Newtownabbey, whose daughter was refused  entry to her local nursery schools at Whitehouse  Primary School and King&rsquo;s Park Primary    School, to contact Carnlough Community Nursery,  Harryville Nursery in Ballymena or a nursery school in Ballycastle to see  whether they had places available. That was absolutely ludicrous, because it  would be totally impractical for that lady to send her daughter to any of those  nurseries. Ballycastle is 50 miles away from Newtownabbey,  so that would have meant a daily 100-mile round trip without public transport.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The decisions on this matter are along the same lines as  the recent decisions on health cuts, which have been taken without  consideration of how people will get to certain places. It is unreasonable that  children who live down the road from that lady have been accepted into local  nurseries, and sometimes it is down to the fact that parents are on benefits  and so on.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Due to a rise in the birth rate, we now have an  unprecedented nursery-place shortage of around 1,200. However, the news that  the Minister has released &pound;1&middot;3 million for private and voluntary nursery-school  placements is welcome. That will no doubt help to meet the shortage, perhaps  totally so in some cases, and ensure that, where possible, every child will be  placed for the forthcoming school year. However, like the National Association  of Head Teachers, I am concerned that the funding does not cover the state  sector as such and that it will not include the provision of any new places in  nursery schools and nursery units.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Children who attend nursery school benefit in so many  different ways. The preschool experience enhances the social development of all  children, and disadvantaged children gain so much more when they are with  children from different social backgrounds. Children with little or no  preschool experience show poorer cognitive, social and behavioural outcomes at  entry to school and at the end of year one than those who attended preschool.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If high quality preschool education provision has such a  positive effect on children&rsquo;s intellectual and social development, why is every  child not entitled to a funded nursery school placement? I urge the Minister to  provide that basic opportunity for every child. It is totally unacceptable and  unfair that all children do not get the same funding to help them to start  their educational lives. If we do not provide funded nursery places for all  children, we will probably undermine the benefits of taxpayers&rsquo; investments in  later stages of the formal schools system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We appreciate the success in increasing the supply of  preschool education over an 11-year period, and it is well noted that uptake  has increased from 44% to 90%. However, there are geographical gaps in supply  and demand. Parental choice contributes to the amount of places that are available,  and there are some nurseries to which parents just do not want to send their  children. Indeed, parental choice has led to some of the popular state  nurseries being oversubscribed by up to 30 places, so why does the Minister not  pour the &pound;1&middot;3 million into accommodating that sector? Those are issues that  hinder our children&rsquo;s development, and they need to be addressed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Every child has the right to develop through educational  and social activity and to learn through play in the preschool environment so  that they can progress into primary 1. I appeal to the Minister for her and the  Department to ensure that every child is well equipped to meet the needs of  primary school foundation stage and years one and two by the time that they  leave preschool. I look forward to her response. I support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Moutray</strong>:  I speak today as a voice for the many people in my constituency who have  received disappointing news about nursery provision for their child or children  in recent weeks. In the Upper Bann constituency,  and particularly in Lurgan and Portadown, I have been inundated with complaints  from parents on this very emotive and important issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have spoken to people who are rightly angry, annoyed and  deeply concerned about the matter. Those parents want answers to many  questions. Why was this allowed to happen? Why is there not equality for all  children across the board? Why should their children be discriminated against?  Why were they signposted to preschool places in locations that are 20, 30 or  even 40 miles away from where they live? Why can additional provision not be  provided by statutory bodies? Why has there been, and why is there, no  long-term strategy for nursery provision? I call on the Minister to answer  those questions, because it is a most unfortunate and undesirable situation for  any community to be in.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">All Members are aware that births and deaths are  registered, and I want to know why that information was not used in the forward  planning for nursery provision. I have only to look at the figures for  Craigavon to see clearly that there is a shortfall in the region of 200 places  for children who are in the target age group and another 150 for younger  children. That is clearly the case in other areas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It goes without saying that nursery provision is a pivotal  part of our society. It affords children a good start in education, and it is  proven by many research reports that nursery education adds value to the lives  of the young children who avail themselves of it. Additionally, it provides a safe  and secure service for parents and families who ultimately want the best  education and the best possible start for their children. Furthermore, it  assists parents who work to avail themselves of such a service to aid their  family, home and working life.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It grieves me that this situation has spiralled out of  control. Often, Members from all sides of the House talk about delivering for  constituents, young and old. Surely the Department needs to be proactive in  delivering for the youngest constituents. Preschool provision is a key element  in the future of all our children. It will mould them and prepare them for  their primary and secondary education, and in many instances it is a criterion  for obtaining a place in primary 1. Therefore, I call on the Minister to  address this matter not in an ad hoc way, as she has done recently, but in a  long-term way.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, I am concerned lest the lack of provision  escalates to the primary 1 class spaces in the following admission years. It is  logical that, if there is a shortage of nursery provision, there will be a  shortage in the primary 1 provision. That needs to be addressed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I acknowledge the Minister&rsquo;s most recent announcement, but  I am concerned about the distribution of that financial boost and the fact that  none of the money will go towards statutory bodies. I have no issue with  private organisations availing themselves of the funding, but equality is  required among private and statutory providers. I am aware of one school in my  constituency that could readily take an extra nursery class, and it would have  it within weeks, were the Minister prepared to accede to the request.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There needs to be a clear link with statistics on current  birth rates so that we do not find ourselves in this situation again. Reasonable  suggestions should be put to parents should their first choice be unavailable,  they should not be offered nursery provision that is some 30 or 40 miles away.  I support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I,  too, support the motion. I reflect on the fact that, over the past decade,  access to preschool education has greatly improved. However, it is important  that we complete the job and ensure that there is better planning and that all  children have access to early years education in their immediate preschool  year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am disappointed with the explanation that the failure in  provision is due to unprecedented demand. Like other Members, I have been  contacted by constituents who have not been successful in any of their four  applications. One family applied to a nursery school that was 200 yards from  their front door, in what is deemed an area of need, yet the application was  unsuccessful. Interestingly, that family&rsquo;s details came into the hand of  someone in the private sector, and the family was offered a place at &pound;25 a week,  which it cannot afford. Therefore, children in disadvantaged communities are  not getting places in their immediate preschool year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s announcement last week of an extra  &pound;1<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; ">&#8729;</span>3 million for additional  places. However, where is the joined-up government in this? Why can we not  predict roughly the number of places required in each ward? In the Northern  Ireland Neighbourhood Information Service (NINIS) section of the Northern  Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) website, one can see how many  children were born in 2008. I am sure that the Department of Education has the  statistics showing how many children are in their immediate preschool year in  each area. It should not take a great deal of work to decide whether additional  places are needed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with the Members who said that we need to alter the  procedural criteria to ensure that children who are in their immediate  preschool year are given priority at that vital time. I ask the Minister to  look into that issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Public Accounts Committee&rsquo;s (PAC) recent report drew  attention to the fact that to have mixed age groups, in which two-year-olds  might sit in with children in their preschool year, is not the best model. The  disparity in the children&rsquo;s abilities makes that a difficult situation for any  organisation to manage. It also limits the educational opportunities for all  the children, whether they be younger or older. That issue definitely needs to  be addressed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with the proposer of the motion and other Members,  who questioned the different funding levels. Why do voluntary or private sector  playgroups receive less funding for children than those in the nursery sector?  Will the Minister explain the reason for that inequality? Why are children who  cannot get a place in a nursery school not given a similar level of funding so  that they can receive a similar or higher quality of education elsewhere? I  cannot accept any reasoning for that, but I look forward to an explanation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Recommendation 2 of the PAC&rsquo;s &lsquo;Report on The Pre-School  Education Expansion Programme&rsquo; indicated that there is a need for  &ldquo;age-appropriate&rdquo; training, which relates to the issue of two-year-olds being  among older children.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Another issue identified was that different models are  being used. We have reception classes, nursery classes and playgroups, and, I  dare say, a degree of funding is also going into Sure Start. Joined-up thinking  is needed. We need to work out which is the most appropriate model and where  the funding should go, rather than continue with the current scattergun  approach. I suggest that there is a particular need to address what will most  benefit children and, in some cases, their parents.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The PAC also recently recommended that, to improve overall  standards of literacy and numeracy, the Department needs to bring forward the  publication of its nought-to-six early years strategy. The Minister has been in  post for three years. She has only about one year left. When will we see the  strategy? We need to see it. Early intervention is the key to reversing the  cycle of deprivation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention to the issue of  post-primary schoolchildren who have less than 85% school attendance. Those  early years are vital if that statistic is to be corrected. A reply to my  question for written answer 972/10 revealed that, in some parts of my  constituency, 40% of children have school attendance rates of less than 85%.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Bring your remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: In  more affluent areas, that figure is 4%. Minister, if we want children to benefit,  we must ensure that they are at school and that we address the reasons for  their absence.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  My colleague Dominic Bradley laid out the basis for my party&rsquo;s concerns about  preschool places. Although the SDLP welcomes the Minister&rsquo;s decision to provide  additional funding of up to &pound;1&middot;3 million to meet the shortage of preschool  places, it is obvious that the motion has put pressure on the Department to  address the crisis.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Figures show that the total number of nursery places  available for 2010-11 is 5,850 but that 7,047 applications have been received  for the same period. Those figures simply do not add up. I and, I am sure, many  others in the House have been contacted by numerous parents who have been  turned down for not only their first choice of preschool for their child but  for all of their choices. Some parents have even been offered places at nursery  schools miles from their home address, which will not only be a great  inconvenience but will involve spending additional money that many families do  not have in the current economic climate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s funding announcement for my  constituency in Derry. I hope that it will  address the city&rsquo;s lack of appropriate preschool nursery places. However,  parents in Derry will be interested most in  what that funding will mean on the ground for our children. The Minister must  act promptly to allay the anxieties of parents who remain in the dark about  their child&rsquo;s future. Parents also need to hear just how the funding will be  distributed so that they know whether their children will benefit from it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In my area of Shantallow, there were 145 applications for  102 available preschool places. Consequently, 43 children have been turned down  for a funded nursery school place. Now that the Minister has provided  additional funding, she must do everything possible to support parents and  children by ensuring that early years provision is accessible, close and  realistic.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The crisis in preschool places also raises the issue of the  early years strategy. During previous debates in the House, we were told about  a strategy for children aged nought to six. We were told that it would be the  blueprint for a way forward and would provide preschool education to each and  every child. However, we have yet to see that strategy. Earlier this year, I  tabled a question about the publication of that document. I was told that it  would be published in the early spring. However, it is now only five weeks  until recess, and there has been no mention of when it will happen.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To ensure that parents do not face the same problem next  year of a disparity between the number of applications and the number of  preschool places, I call on the Minister to give a definite date for the  publication of the early years strategy. I also ask her examine the funding of  existing schools and consider whether some of that should be given to  preschools. Given the situation, they could be extremely helpful. The Minister  is bound to know that &mdash; she is the Minister of Education.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Browne</strong>:  I support the motion. It is no secret that my East Belfast  constituency has suffered from a lack of nursery provision for many years. Last  year alone, of the 34% of children who were unable to find a place in the area,  41% did not find a place anywhere. Others who found places were forced to  travel to places as far away as Ardoyne and Newtownabbey.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The only solution that the Department has offered is the  promise of a review. Indeed, it appears that the Minister&rsquo;s solution to every  problem in the education system is to hold endless reviews, while continuing to  do as she pleases in the meantime. She must appreciate that the problem is far  too large and widespread to be dealt with by a simple review.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has failed to provide an adequate level of  preschool cover. She has failed to predict the demand for preschool places, and  she has failed to invest wisely for the future. Last year, there were around  800 places for 1,200 applicants in my constituency, which is a shortfall of  400. When I asked the Minister to estimate the number of applications for this  year, she informed me that her Department expected to receive 896. I admit that  I have no particular skill or qualification in the study of demographics and  population shifts, but even I realised that a drop of 25% in one year was  extremely unlikely. However, the Department of Education based its projections  on those figures and organised the provision accordingly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the event, applications fell by only 7% this year.  Therefore, because of the Minister&rsquo;s actions, one in six children from my  constituency is without a preschool place. The Minister knows as well as anyone  that early years learning is essential to a child&rsquo;s educational development.  She knows that the system is failing. As the number of preschool places falls  far below the level of demand, the children of parents who cannot afford to pay  lose out. Under the current scheme, working class children suffer the most.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: Is  the Member aware that 38% of the children of primary school age in the Woodstock ward of his  constituency have a school attendance rate of less than 85%? Would places in  preschool playgroups improve their social skills and opportunities at school?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member has an extra minute in which to speak.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Browne</strong>:  I thank the Member for that fact. The attendance issue must be addressed. The  provision of more places at an earlier age may help to combat that problem.  Only by taking appropriate measures will we be able to improve attendance  figures.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister informed a preschool group in a working class  area of east Belfast  that its funding for this year had been withdrawn. She told that charity that  there was not enough money and that it did not have enough children to justify  the funding. At the same time, she spent &pound;88,000 on temporary accommodation for  a new Irish-medium preschool, with a capacity of just 26, which is being  created in west Belfast.<span class="SectionMarker"><em><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></em></span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department should be working to ensure that preschool  places are available to all, so that no children are left behind. Many parents  cannot escape the conclusion that the Minister&rsquo;s priorities lie elsewhere. She  would rather devote her time to crushing dissent about academic selection and  working on her pet project, Irish-medium schools, than spend time working to  improve children&rsquo;s prospects in life.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: It  is important to understand why we are we focusing on this topic and giving it  the attention that it deserves. It is because the research is clear: young  people who are given a preschool place will, as Lord Browne said, do better  socially and, as the Member for East Antrim  said, develop a positive attitude and be motivated to attend school and to  achieve when they are there. I say that not just because our manifesto stated  that we would front-load services towards early years; it goes beyond that. The  entire research base shows that providing young people with those opportunities  guarantees greater success later.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Dallat] in the Chair)</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I declare an interest as a governor of Donaghadee Primary School.  In that capacity, I constantly have to field difficult questions about children  who have been turned away. When we get down to criterion 4(c) and beyond, we  have to tell young people that the decision about whether they can attend  depends on their date of birth and that, because they were born two weeks after  another child, the other child gets the place. That is the difficulty that I  and other governors face. The children who are turned away will not get a  second chance. A preschool place is not an optional extra, and that is why  failure to offer one is not an option.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Where was the planning? Did we not know that those children  were in the system? Did they appear suddenly? No, we knew for years that they  were coming through. Minister, is it not the case that, when you fail to plan,  in reality, you plan to fail? In the case of early years education, you planned  to fail. Children are being failed, and they will not get a second opportunity  to make up for that lost time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Is the Minister listening? Has she listened to the  teachers&rsquo; unions? Had she listened to Mr Arbuthnot, who had a distinguished  career as the principal of Priory Integrated College and whom I know well, and  had she kept the South Eastern Education and Library Board as opposed to paying  her commissioners &pound;500 a day, she would have heard Mr Arbuthnot saying through  the board that opportunities exist in the state sector to establish  curriculum-based nursery/preschool placements in primary schools. Such  placements have a proven track record of success. Why are the likes of Donaghadee Primary School turning children away? We  will not be able to access the &pound;1&middot;3 million &mdash; I welcome it &mdash; that has been made  available. If the money was there, why was it not made available earlier, and  why were parents put through the trauma that they have experienced? Why are we  not listening to the teachers&rsquo; unions? Why are we not listening to principals,  who are telling us that the state sector has a proven track record of success?  Is that not something that we would want to build on, rather than ignore?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My concluding point has been well made already. Where is  the early years strategy? What strategy is the Minister working towards? I  remember my father telling me that you are better to aim at something and miss  it than to aim at nothing and hit it. Without a strategy, is it a case of the  Minister aiming at nothing and hitting it? I do not know which of the  Minister&rsquo;s priorities were more important to plan for than the children in the  early years sector who are being turned away from preschool education and are  not getting a second chance. I fail to see, as would any rational observer,  what the more stringent priorities were that had to come before the children. I  encourage the Minister to look again at the state sector. Do not let bias or  poor judgement cloud &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to bring his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>:  Where there is a proven track record of success, the Minister should build on  it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education (Ms Ruane)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. T&aacute; &aacute;thas  orm an deis seo a fh&aacute;il chun d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht a dh&eacute;anamh le Comhalta&iacute; ar  shaincheist na n-&aacute;iteanna r&eacute;amhscoile do ph&aacute;ist&iacute; don scoilbhliain at&aacute; le  teacht. Tuigim go maith an t&aacute;bhacht a bhaineann le luathbhlianta an ph&aacute;iste  agus leis na tairbh&iacute; a dh&eacute;anann oideachas r&eacute;amhscoile d&rsquo;ardchaighde&aacute;n.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Before I go into the details on preschool education, I will  deal with some of the questions that were raised. The recent Public Accounts  Committee document &lsquo;Report on The Pre-School Education Expansion Programme&rsquo; was  very positive. The issues that were identified in that report, along with those  in the chief inspector&rsquo;s report, will be addressed in the early years strategy.  Those include raising standards and issues that relate to equality and  workforce development.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There was much talk today of the early years strategy.  Suffice it to say that I approved the strategy for consultation on 24 April and  it will go out for consultation. A letter is on its way to the Committee, and I  will be doing an official launch. I very much look forward to hearing all the  wonderful ideas that Members may have, because we heard from a lot of Solomons  earlier.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although preschool is not a compulsory phase of education,  I welcome the fact that parents recognise and want that beneficial experience  for their children. I am aware that the coming school year appears to have an  unprecedented shortage of preschool places in certain areas. Therefore, from  the outset, I acknowledge the concerns of parents and their children, and I  assure them that my officials and I are making every effort to resolve the  situation as quickly as possible. My officials have, therefore, been working  closely with the PEAGs over the past few weeks to confirm the current number of  unplaced children so that we can decide how best to respond to the demand that  has arisen. I confirm that around 1,200 children in their final preschool year  are known to be unplaced at this stage of the preschool admissions arrangements  for the coming school year. On the basis of the cost of funding a preschool  place in the private and voluntary sector, which is essentially the mechanism  that we use to respond to variations in demand, the total cost of placing those  children amounts to approximately &pound;1&middot;3 million.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Fortunately, I am not a cynical person. If I were, I would  be forgiven for thinking that some people in the SDLP, the UUP and the DUP are  disappointed that we have found resources during difficult times for that very  important issue. Indeed, members of the SDLP who were in previous ministerial  positions and who lamented on the issue have issued press releases. They had  the opportunity to back this with funding, but they did not. They never sought  a meeting with me on the issue. Instead, they run to the press with negative  press releases. With respect to everybody, please stop playing politics with  preschool children. Apart from Members in my party, Trevor Lunn was one of the  few people who acknowledged that it was good that we have found &pound;1&middot;3 million in  these difficult times.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am delighted to hear the concern for the working-class  communities. However, that concern goes out the window when all the evidence  shows that selection disadvantages working-class children. I am also pleased to  hear that the DUP is listening to the teachers&rsquo; union. That is good. I hope  that it listens to all the teachers&rsquo; unions, as every single one of them,  without exception, supports an end to selection and wants more equality in  education.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In recognition of the importance of preschool education, I  have announced my intention to make additional provision of up to &pound;1&middot;3 million  for the PEAGs to meet the shortfall in places and to ensure that, where  possible, every child will be placed for the 2010-11 school year. That brings  the number of funded preschool places available to 22,559, with 14,202 places  in the statutory sector and sufficient funding for 8,357 places in the  voluntary or private sector. For those who are good at maths and for those who  appear to believe that the statutory sector has been discriminated against,  that equates to 63% in the statutory sector and 37% in the voluntary or private  sector. That means that approximately two out of every three existing funded  preschool places are in the statutory nursery sector. I have also just approved  an additional unit in a statutory nursery in the Portadown area, which brings  the total number of statutory nurseries approved since May 2007 to 12 and  represents 312 additional statutory nursery places. It is a pity that none of  the Members from Portadown raised that issue. In addition, I have approved two  development proposals from statutory nursery settings to change from part-time  to full-time provision, in line with parental demand.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The policy for preschool provision currently relates to a  preschool place:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;for every child whose parents wish it.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That reflects its non-compulsory nature. In  planning for the overall demand, the Department is aware, through the household  omnibus survey, that around 10% of parents do not want a preschool place for  their child. The remaining 90% of children &mdash; more in recent years &mdash; have availed  themselves of the opportunity of preschool education in all settings, including  Irish-medium. Therefore, we are victims of our own success and should celebrate  that success.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One Member &mdash; it may have been Roy Beggs &mdash; mentioned  increasing the Department&rsquo;s percentages. Prior to the introduction of the  pre-school education expansion programme in 1997, only 45% of children received  a funded preschool education place in statutory nurseries and reception  classes. By 2009-2010, 97% of the cohort of three- to four-year-olds had been  allocated a preschool place. Let us give credit where credit is due, because  that is significant growth in a relatively short period. That rate of expansion  could only have taken place through a partnership approach, recognising and  utilising the existing provision that had developed in the voluntary and  private sectors in the North of Ireland, alongside the substantial expansion of  the statutory nursery sector. Indeed, more than 100 new nursery schools and  units have been created under the pre-school education expansion programme.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The management of preschool places is a complex process,  and it seeks to achieve the best possible match between places and children.  Although my Department retains policy and budgetary responsibility for the  programme, planning and implementation at local level is the responsibility of  the PEAGs in each education and library board. You all have members on  education and library boards, and I will be very interested to examine the  minutes of those board meetings to see what work has been done on preschools  and the questions that were asked.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: No, I will not. Those groups undertake an annual review of local  provision, taking into account factors such as demographic changes and the  relocation or closure of settings to ensure that the allocation of places to  voluntary or private sector providers continues to meet the needs of each area.  The processing of applications and the offering of preschool places in nursery  schools, nursery units in primary schools and voluntary and private preschool  settings in receipt of funded places are the responsibility of individual  providers in conjunction with the PEAGs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although all sectors that deliver preschool education are  valued equally, the availability of a place is not sufficient on its own. The  Department is committed to ensuring that provision is of the highest quality  possible. The system in place also needs to be flexible, whereby parents can  choose whether their child would be best placed in a full-time or part-time  afternoon or morning preschool session, dependent on the child&rsquo;s stage of  development and on whether the parents are working.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although the level of provision overall within the  pre-school education expansion programme may be sufficient, it may not exactly  match demographic demand at any given time, and there may be a number of  reasons for that. The application system is flexible, with parents asked to  list a choice of settings in order of preference. In some cases, parents may  not be offered a place for their child because they have failed to take full  advantage of the preschool application process. For example, they may not have  listed the maximum possible four choices, or they may have restricted  themselves in their choice of provider. At the end of the annual admissions  process, the preschool education advisory groups advise my Department on  anticipated areas of pressure and consider how they can be managed.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">C&eacute; gur cuireadh na socruithe um iontr&aacute;il r&eacute;amhscoile don  bhliain 2010-2011 i gcr&iacute;ch ar 30 Aibre&aacute;n, t&aacute; an pr&oacute;iseas iontr&aacute;la r&eacute;amhscoile  f&oacute;s ar si&uacute;l.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although the preschool admissions arrangements for the  2010-11 school year were completed on 30 April, the preschool admissions  process is still ongoing. The education and library boards are currently  reallocating places between providers in the voluntary and private sectors to  facilitate, as far as possible, children in their final preschool year who have  been unable to access a funded preschool place. The additional funding that I  have made available will enable the education and library boards to extend the  number of places that are available.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am aware that there may also be opportunities to offer  increased statutory provision, and I do not exclude the possibility of  proposals for further development in that area being approved. However, time is  short, and it appears that the private and voluntary sector is best placed to  respond in the short timescale that is available. That would also offer  flexibility if that should prove to be a temporary increase. Preschool  education is a genuine partnership between the statutory sector and the  voluntary and private sectors. My Department, together with the education and  library boards, will of course look at all avenues to address the unprecedented  demand for places.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will now talk about the budget, because, when Members get  into a frenzy, they forget how much we are spending on preschool education. I  originally set an allocation of over &pound;11 million to the education and library  boards to secure preschool places in the private and voluntary sectors. That  figure includes an additional &pound;300,000 to maintain the increased number of  funded places provided in the 2009-2010 school year. That is over and above the  funding for the statutory nursery sector. We are spending approximately &pound;48  million on the statutory preschool sector. I have now announced that I will  make a further provision of up to &pound;1&middot;3 million available to the sector. If I  have done the maths correctly, which I did without a calculator, that is a  total of &pound;60&middot;3 million. That is a substantial amount of money by anyone&rsquo;s  standards. Of course we want more money, and perhaps the parties opposite will  talk to their various Ministers and to the Finance Minister so that I can have  more money for preschool places. I look forward to getting more resources so  that people walk the walk instead of just talking the talk.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have made clear the importance that I attach to the  sector. However, the identification of additional resources has not been easy  in the current economic climate. My priority has been to protect front line services  and to ensure that the needs of the people who are most disadvantaged continue  to be to the forefront. I look forward to the Members opposite supporting the  establishment of the ESA, because they will be aware of the wastage of  resources on administration and bureaucracy. If Members are serious about  preschool education, they will move forward quickly on the establishment of the  ESA so that there are not quangos and a waste of resources on bureaucracy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have endeavoured to clarify some of the factors that need  to be taken into account in managing the complex process of allocating  preschool places. I pay tribute to my officials, who have worked hard on that.  I recognise the difficulties that have been faced this year, and I hope that  the additional funding that I have made available will address the shortfall in  places. The preschool year is an important time for children, and I am  committed to ensuring that a quality preschool place is available for every  child whose parents want it, whether they attend preschool through the medium  of English or Irish, in their immediate preschool year.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  It is only fair to acknowledge the Minister&rsquo;s announcement that we are to see,  at very long last, after six years, the nought-to-six strategy. It has taken as  many years for the strategy to emerge as it will cover in a young person&rsquo;s  life, but better late than never. Let us hope that, although it has been long  in its gestation, it is capable of meeting, in every sense, the expectations of  Members on all sides of the House. The one thing that we have failed to do  collectively as a region for many years is to put young children at the heart  of policymaking.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Before I go into the specifics of the debate, it is worth  noting that, although much of the motion deals with the current crisis in the  allocation of nursery spaces, it also makes a specific call on the Minister.  The last couple of lines of the motion asks the Minister to:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;bring forward proposals to ensure that each child  receives a preschool place in the year immediately before starting school.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: Does the Member accept that PEAGs were  established to ensure that this crisis would not occur? The Minister alluded to  that but, as usual, did not expand on it. However, we have ended up in a  situation in which we have a crisis and a shortfall, and the Minister thinks  that the problem will go away just by throwing money at it. Where were the  PEAGs? What advice did they give to the Minister?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  That is part of the point of the motion. We need a more interventionist  Minister in the areas where she needs to be doing her job and a less  interventionist Minister in the areas where it is, to use teenager parlance, a  no-brainer to get on with doing what needs to be done in other areas of  education.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I would have been much happier if, during the 13-odd  minutes that the Minister took to respond to the debate, she had been able to  provide us with the leadership that is so absent on this issue and with the  specific details of the proposals that she intends to bring forward to address  the shortfall. None of us will begrudge a &pound;60 million investment in preschool  learning, and none of us will question the commitment of many public servants  in this region and the House to that investment, but we will wonder why we had  13 minutes of celebration of a direct rule decision that was made in 1997. It  may be a decision that is to our liking and that we feel able to support, but  it is one towards which the Minister generally seems reluctant to be in any way  favourable. It is normally the case that the Minister comes to the House and  makes speeches about the hideousness of British Government decisions. I digress  slightly, but the most interesting reference that I ever heard was a reference  to an Education Act that provided so many who sit in these Benches with the  single greatest opportunity in life. When Members get into that level of  politics, they begin to lose the run of themselves and the point of their being  here in the first place.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The debate was dominated by one side. It was not a  sectarian side; it was a pro-motion side. Mr O&rsquo;Dowd did his best in three  minutes of the six that were available to him to speak up for the issues at the  heart of his side of the argument. Mr O&rsquo;Dowd is a good debater, and we all  enjoy the cut and thrust of his argument from time to time, but I think that  most of us will have had sympathy for the situation in which he found himself  today whereby Sinn F&eacute;in was not able to produce a second Member to speak when it  had ample opportunity to do so.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  The reason why Sinn F&eacute;in did not supply a second Member to speak today is that  she was at the Health Committee discussing health issues. She is the Deputy  Chairperson of the Health Committee. It took me only three minutes to announce  that the Minister had put &pound;1&middot;3 million into the system. If your own Minister  would learn how to do that sort of work, it would take only three minutes to do  that as well.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I thank Mr O&rsquo;Dowd for his intervention; it has been one of the easier ones to  rebut. I acknowledge the excellent work of the Deputy Chairperson of the Health  Committee, a lady we know to have many talents. I have to say that your Benches  are well filled, Mr O&rsquo;Dowd. You are in the second largest party in the  Assembly, and the fact that you are relying on Mrs O&rsquo;Neill to save you and your  colleagues from having to justify or defend this argument says a lot about  yourselves, as does the fact that you were not able to make more than about  three and a half minutes of cohesive argument.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In opening the debate, Dominic Bradley talked about the  social need and justice issues at the core of nursery provision. That theme was  repeated often on all sides of the House. At the heart of the matter are  fundamental issues of equality that are not addressed in the current policy  framework and are not reflected in the way that the Department or the Minister  respond to it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Storey talked about the need for leadership, which is a  theme that emerges again and again. Basil McCrea asked about the nought-to-six  strategy, and I am sure that he will be happy to hear that the strategy is on  its way to the Committee. He also asked a specific question about shortfalls,  and, to be fair to the Minister, she did as much as she could to address that  question. However, there is an underlying issue in that we seem to rely on the  voluntary and private sector to buffer demographic shifts. If memory serves me  right, there is a 60:40 breakdown in funding between units that are in the  statutory sector and those that are not. It is a big buffer and is potentially  expensive. That brings us back to the final element of the motion, which is a  call for specific strategic proposals to manage the situation. In an  intervention, a point was made about occasionally taking the advice of PEAGs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Lunn was as constructive as ever and repeated the  questions about the breakdown between private and public provision. Mr Hilditch  asked specific questions about his constituency. A theme that emerged  throughout the debate was young parents often facing their first real encounter  with education, at a time when they are most stressed out about the decisions  that they need to make on behalf of the young people whose lives have been  entrusted to them. Those parents are confused and uncertain; I hear that from  my constituents.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Roy Beggs raised an important issue, which is the link  between early years provision and a child&rsquo;s potential later in life. If we  intervene early, we know that we stand a much better chance of being able to  protect children from being at risk in the future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that the early years strategy is riddled with  commitments to invest in the very first years of a child&rsquo;s life. I also hope  that, for the first time in many years, we change the culture of this region  from being simply about investment in excellence to actually investing in  children. I am sure that all sides of the House will support that notion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mrs Bradley raised any number of constituency issues, as  well as playing the numbers game. The two ladies who seemed to be in the mood  to play the numbers game today were Mrs Bradley and the Minister. Lord Browne  talked about the experience in East Belfast  and the class divide there, as did Jonathan Bell.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We probably all feel that it has been a useful debate. We  will be genuinely happy to hear from the Minister that an early years  nought-to-six strategy exists and that it is on its way to the Committee for Education.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will finish by making a simple appeal. Whatever debate  takes place about the early years strategy cannot become a debate about the  issue that the Minister raised in the three minutes and 20 seconds of her  contribution, which was one simple point of policy clouding out the bigger  debate. Let us have a debate about the wrong that we need to address, which is  the state&rsquo;s neglect of the needs of young children. If we neglect those young  children, we sow the seeds of future problems, which will cost us so much to  address.<span class="SectionMarker"><em><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></em></span></p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">Question put and agreed to.</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">Resolved:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That this Assembly acknowledges the grave  disappointment and financial hardship faced by many parents who have been  unable to secure preschool places for their children; recognises the disparity  between the number of applications and the number of preschool places; and  calls on the Minister of Education and the Executive to examine urgently the  number and distribution of nursery school places and to bring forward proposals  to ensure that each child receives a preschool place in the year immediately  before starting school.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">Motion made:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That the Assembly do now adjourn. &mdash; [Mr Deputy  Speaker.]</p>
    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="9"></a>Adjournment</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Urban Renewal Area Status: &nbsp;Upper Long Streets</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind Members that the proposer of the Adjournment topic will  have 15 minutes in which to speak. All other Members will have approximately  seven minutes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Business Committee for  selecting the Adjournment topic, and I apologise on behalf of my colleague  Gerry Kelly, who is out of the country. I also want to use the opportunity to welcome  the Minister to his post. I wish him well.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the recent decision to approve urban renewal  status for the upper long streets, Parkside and the Glen, and the full  redevelopment of the area. The campaign has been no fewer than 11 years &mdash;  almost 12 &mdash; in the making. For that reason, I pay tribute to the residents and,  indeed, to the wider community for their tenacity and persistence in ensuring  that their areas are redeveloped in the way that they deserve. I also pay  tribute to the democratically elected residents&rsquo; groups who, despite the  despondence and hopelessness that prevailed, held annual general meetings to  set out their programmes of work.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although I have not worked with the residents&rsquo; groups for  the full 11 years &mdash; I have not even been an elected representative for that  long &mdash; I was disappointed at the way in which the decision was made, simply  because my party colleagues worked with them. I was disappointed at the way in  which the former Minister announced her decision. I heard about her decision on  the radio. I want to ensure, however, that my disappointment is not conveyed to  the staff in the Department for Social Development (DSD) who worked with my  party, other parties and the elected residents&rsquo; groups. However, that pinch to  an otherwise good news story was unfortunate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Adjournment topic was debated on 31 March 2009, which  was some 13 months ago. The then Minister for Social Development, Margaret  Ritchie, stated:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I have asked for those plans to be resubmitted before  the end of April [2009], and I want to announce the way forward shortly  afterwards. In fact, I have been told that proposals will be with me next  week.&rdquo; &mdash; [Official Report, Bound Volume 39, p380, col 2].</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Thirteen months later, here we are.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The issue was raised on practically every doorstep,  particularly in the upper long streets before the most recent election. It  became obvious to me and to other parties who canvassed in those areas that all  political parties and residents must have the same information, as opposed to  the drip feed of information that we have received to date. I appeal to the  Minister to rectify that wrong and to start off on the right foot by engaging  with all residents&rsquo; groups in those areas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have questions for the Minister, which I hope that he  will answer when he is on his feet, although I do not expect that he will be  able to answer all of them. I accept and appreciate that he is new to the post.  However, I expect answers to some of my questions. Will he tell me when proper  consultation and engagement with residents will begin? The consultation that  residents&rsquo; groups secured with the Housing Executive some years ago is due to  commence on Wednesday 26 May 2010. It will take the form of a door-to-door  survey, which, now that the announcement has been made, will involve residents  in setting out the way forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have been asked when the process to redevelop Girdwood  will begin. It has always been the understanding, rightly or wrongly, that the  site would be used for what is known as &ldquo;decanting&rdquo;. Now that an urban renewal  area has been declared, will homes be purchased? What is the time frame for the  commencement and completion of those schemes?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate that, during various debates, Assembly Members  have spoken genuinely on the effects of the economic downturn, particularly on  the construction industry. Members who are on the Committee for Employment and  Learning and the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment have discussed the lack of apprenticeships. I regard the  renewal of urban areas, particularly north Belfast, which still suffers extremely high  levels of deprivation, as an opportunity. Not only is it an opportunity to  kick-start the construction industry in those areas, but it enables young  people who are not in education, employment or training to aspire to be part of  that redevelopment. I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s thoughts and comments  on that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I would also like to ask how and when the procurement  process started, how it was announced, and whether there will be social clauses  built into the contracts. I appreciate that I have probably asked more  questions here today; but that is what these debates are for. They are  questions that I have been asked on the doorsteps and that I have raised  through private notice questions and engagements and meetings with the  Department.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Residents are concerned that more often than not &mdash; I know  that it is not the intention of Ministers or Departments &mdash; officials describe  consultation as putting an advertisement in a public paper and if people  respond well and good: they have &ldquo;consulted&rdquo;. However, since people have  campaigned courageously for almost 12 years to have houses that are more than  100 years old made fit for purpose through newbuilds and redevelopment, it is  important to scotch rumours that only certain types of houses will be built and  that there will be apartment blocks. That was never the understanding at any of  the meetings that I attended with the Housing Executive and the Department.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There was to be a housing mix. In my understanding that  meant homes that are suitable for people with disabilities or perhaps  redeveloping existing flats; there could be a one-bedroom or two-bedroom  ground-floor flat beside a three- or four-bedroom family home. At no stage were  apartment blocks mentioned. We know that money is scarce and that there will be  pressure on housing schemes, but we cannot assume that the bulk of newbuilds will  be apartments. People in my constituency know the Department&rsquo;s solution for  providing family homes in north Belfast  &mdash; apartments. That has to end.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I know that the Minister, even before he took up his post,  has been acutely aware of the housing situation in north and west Belfast, and  perhaps even in Derry city &mdash; three of the areas most in need. North   Belfast tops the list. It was with great sadness and  disappointment that I learned that his colleague Margaret Ritchie had removed  the ring-fencing of funding for the social housing development programme.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Need in north Belfast has not lessened, despite the  intervention of human rights and residents&rsquo; groups; even those who can afford  to buy have had to go as far as Glenavy and Crumlin for affordable housing. It  causes displacement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The redevelopment scheme for the upper long streets, the  Parkside and Glen areas is an opportunity; it should be a new beginning for us  all. We can enter into meaningful dialogue and engagement in the consultation;  however, it is crucial that elected representatives and the representatives of  residents&rsquo; groups, some of which represent more than 100 people, be  meaningfully involved in the process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to talk about the need to deliver on equality and  objective need and about how that will be delivered through the scheme. I  mentioned the construction industry and the number of apprenticeships and the  fact that high unemployment figures have not gone down. The NISRA report  testifies to that. North Belfast suffers  proportionately higher levels of homelessness, people in housing need and  housing stress. In some cases three families &mdash; and, in my area, sometimes four  &mdash; live under one roof. That is totally unacceptable.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are opportunity sites at Girdwood and, perhaps, in  other places where the Department has land that can be transferred for social  housing. We need to try to provide more clarity and detail, particularly when  we are talking about decanting families for those homes. I am aware that a  significant number of people have bought their homes, but the majority of  people living in those streets have not. I am aware that there are huge levels  of dereliction. Absentee homeowners are leaving houses in those streets  &ldquo;steeled up&rdquo;. While the residents have put up with that situation on the basis  and in the hope that those streets would be redeveloped, we need to look at  that as part of the immediate way forward. The people who own those houses need  to take responsibility.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has only to contact pest control at Belfast  City Council to have it confirmed that the pest problems in that area are  unlike those in any other area of Belfast.  I am not waxing lyrical or gilding the lily. The problem has been openly  publicised in many local papers. Belfast City Council has done its best to try  to find out who the homeowners are. Those responsible for developing the north Belfast housing strategy,  such as Sharon Beattie, have also been very helpful.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I repeat that key to the matter is the involvement of  residents, their families and the community in the redevelopment. People see  the redevelopment as a massive opportunity for the area. When people see an  area being redeveloped, it helps them emotionally and psychologically. It gives  the area a lift. The situation will be the complete opposite to the one that we  are in now. The fabric of the community that the residents have held together  despite everything has to be commended. However, unless there is clarification  about the very welcome decision, the sparkle of a very good news story, which  is almost a week old, will dissipate. It is important to spell out the detail  on procurement. For example, how has this happened? In what way were the  residents involved? Will social contracts be built into it? When the contracts  are awarded, what will be the process for ongoing consultation and engagement?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will finish by welcoming the Minister to his post. I look  forward to having a good working relationship with him. I consider that to be  essential. I see him smirking, but I am being genuine in what I say. We do not  have all the answers despite our experience &mdash; none of us do &mdash; but the  residents&rsquo; experience is priceless. I appeal to the Minister and the Department  to engage with the residents on the way forward as soon as possible. The  residents are the people who have solely defended and cultivated support for  development in the area for a long time. They are the people who have taken it  in the neck for other residents. They are the people who, despite all the  negativity and, at times, hopelessness, have been inspiring and have insisted  that the Department and representatives, such as me, deliver on the promises  that we make on the doorstep from one election to the next.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  First, I apologise on behalf of Alban Maginness, who would very much like to be  here to speak in the debate. As colleagues will know, he is away with the  Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment in his capacity as Chair.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the investment. As Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n said, it is an  important and big news day for people who have been living in a part of the  city that, I am sure we all agree, has suffered more than most, not just from  the legacy of the conflict but from the real effect of urban decay and the  degradation of public housing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I grew up in a council house. Thankfully, it was not a  council house that was in need of much work. Without question, in communities  where we rely on the state or a public authority to put a roof over our heads,  the sense of dignity that that roof provides is even more acute, and we are  always all the more aware of it. It gives us a sense of pride in who we are. It  gives a sense of purpose to our lives and the opportunity to dream that life  can, of course, be better and stronger.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have been in the long streets on several occasions over  the past 15 or 16 years. I have to confess that that was generally at election  time, as I do not represent that part of the city. One could not help but be  struck by the poor condition of the housing, the inadequacy of its state and  the fact that action needed to be taken.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It has been 13 months since the issue was first brought to  the House. However, in light of the debate that we had only a few moments ago  about how long it has taken to produce some of the strategies around here, I am  sure that Members will accept that, by that standard, 13 months is not bad  going. What is important is that we are beginning a conversation today that  will, I hope, involve the residents and lead to the transformation of that part  of the city. The work that is soon to commence will benefit not only the long  streets and the New Lodge area, but the Parkside area, parts of Fortwilliam  Parade and, importantly, Queen   Victoria Gardens.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not want to take up more time talking about a part of  the city for which I have no mandate to speak. However, I wish to acknowledge  the work of Margaret Ritchie. Throughout her tenure as Minister, she was able  to get the maximum amount of public benefit from the budget that was available  to her. I am sure that, in succeeding her, Minister Attwood will want to  continue to wring every last drop of value out of whatever budget he is handed  and, more importantly, to bring dignity to so many thousand people who rely on  the agencies of the state to be able to fulfil their right to housing. He will  also want to ensure that the long streets do not remain a place of despair or  concern but become somewhere where communities can be reborn, not looking back  in anger but looking forward, through the eyes of their children and through  the shared services that I am sure we will see some day soon in Girdwood, to  the potential of communities that are less divided, less strewn and more able  to fully realise their potential.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: I,  too, thank the Minister for following up on his predecessor&rsquo;s recent  announcement about funding for new housing in the long streets and the Glen and  Parkside areas. I obviously do not represent North Belfast.  However, I confess to having some happy memories of it, because I went to  school there. I will not go into any particular reason, but Upper Meadow Street is very close to my  heart. I do not need to come from north Belfast  to know that there is a chronic shortage of social housing there.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Housing Executive has said that in February, 2,147  people were on the waiting list for housing in that area and 1,427 people were  in housing distress. In a society as comparatively wealthy as ours, living in  substandard housing should not be regarded as acceptable. It certainly should  not be regarded as acceptable for anybody to be forced to bring up their family  in someone else&rsquo;s home, perhaps sleeping on a settee for months or years.  Stories such as that are all too prevalent in north Belfast. At the moment, my wife and I are  waiting for market conditions to improve so that we can sell our house and move  to a smaller one, but just a few miles away, three families are living under  one roof. That is absolutely appalling.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are talking about almost the most deprived areas in Northern Ireland.  The recently updated multiple deprivation index shows that the census area that  covers the long streets is the fifteenth most deprived of 890 areas, which puts  it in the top 2%. Water Works 3, which covers the Glen and Parkside areas, is a  bit better. It is the seventy-third most deprived area, but that still puts it  in the top 10% of the poorest communities. That is even before we take into  account the legacy of the Troubles in an area that still lives with deep  community divisions. There are interfaces in the long streets and Parkside. The  interface in Parkside has been a major barrier to urban renewal and has  contributed greatly to dereliction.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is an irrefutable body of evidence that substandard  housing has particularly detrimental consequences on young people growing up. Adolescents  living in overcrowded or substandard homes are unlikely even to have a quiet  space to do their homework properly. As a result, there must be a correlation  between that sort of housing and poor education performance. Similarly, the  correlation between substandard housing and involvement in crime and antisocial  behaviour is probably not unrelated.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We all agree that there is a necessity for further  investment, added to what has already been announced. However, as the proposer  of the motion said, the real challenge is making that investment work.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Members who spoke previously mentioned how important it  is that consultation is done properly. However, I wonder whether consultation  is really the right word in this context. In shaping communities, we need  genuine participation from the people who will live in them. The current houses  on the long streets have stood for around 150 years, and the decisions made now  may determine how that community functions for the next 150 years. We are  talking about making radical changes to the density of housing and the layout  of streets, and about apartments versus terraces. The result, whatever it is,  will be fine, as long as it genuinely represents what the community wants and  not what the planners want.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Democracy is not just about people making speeches in  Chambers such as this one. It is about ordinary people having real control over  their lives. We need to get it right in the New Lodge, the Limestone Road and  everywhere else in that area, not just for those schemes but so that, in the  future, we get it right everywhere in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity to speak  in this debate.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development &nbsp;(Mr Attwood)</strong>: Looking  around the Chamber, I am inclined to start by saying: &ldquo;Speaking to a packed  House&rdquo;. However, that would obviously be slightly inaccurate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I often quote a favourite phrase of mine, which is  appropriate when it comes to the success of the residents involved in this  campaign, who were aided and abetted by various political parties and by the  previous Minister for Social Development. That quote is:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;numberless diverse acts of courage and belief . . .  can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Whether it is an international, national, or, as in this  case, local campaign, that is an accurate expression of what people can  successfully do when they are relentless, persistent and face up to resistance  from wherever it may come.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Despite what Members may have said about Margaret Ritchie  during the debate, through the 11 or 12 years of the campaign, no Minister with  the responsibility for housing, in the lifetime of this Assembly or during the  years of direct rule, was able to get this decision over the line. Whatever  comments may be made in the Chamber or elsewhere, nothing can take away from  that reality.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Members who contributed to the debate and will  try to deal with some of the points that they raised. I welcome this opportunity  to clarify some of the issues and, importantly, to repeat the very good news  that my predecessor, Margaret Ritchie, announced last week. The scale of her  diverse contributions and steely leadership is clear to me at the end of what  is only my second day in post. I will come back to Members if there are any  matters that I am unable to touch on in the time that I have remaining.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some years ago, the Northern Ireland Executive identified  that the upper long streets and the Glen and Parkside areas of north Belfast should be the  focus of significant redevelopment activity, such was the poor condition of  many homes in those areas. However, although there was agreement that  intervention was necessary, no consensus was reached as to what that  intervention should be.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We heard today how long it has taken to bring that  intervention forward. I say at the outset that there is no doubt that it has  taken too long for that work to be completed. Equally, however, let no one  claim or hint that Margaret Ritchie is in any way responsible for that. There  was a suggestion that, in 2009, she gave indications that the matter would be  addressed within weeks. In my view, it would have been folly for the then  Minister for Social Development to make announcements that she was unable to  deliver on thereafter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There have been examples of Ministers who have made  announcements and, years later, we have regretted at our leisure how those  announcements were made and how decisions were taken when a policy, strategy  and implementation plan was not in place to take them forward. Therefore,  although the matter has been delayed since 2009, the Minister was entirely  right to make a final and full decision only when its immediate and full consequences  had been fully acknowledged. I will deal with that matter further shortly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Plans for redevelopment had been in the pipeline for many  years before Margaret Ritchie came into office. Many plans have been developed  and discussed with the local community, but none had ever been formally taken  through to approval. When Margaret Ritchie visited each of the areas, she was  able to see the scale of the problem at first hand. The homes &mdash; inner-city  terraced houses, some of which were over 100 years old &mdash; had reached the end of  their lifespan. Some of them had been refurbished several years previously to  extend their long lives. In reality, further refurbishment was not a realistic  proposition, despite a few suggestions to the contrary. In that respect, the  earlier consultation with the community was useful. The results that were  announced last week show that we have carefully listened to what the community  said.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, there is another issue to address, which we  debated in the Chamber some time ago: the impact of redevelopment on the north Belfast housing waiting  list. As Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n indicated, that waiting list already has tremendous  pressures on it. That is why DSD and Margaret Ritchie needed to develop a  complementary solution to the housing problem in the long streets, the Glen and  the Parkside. It was not credible, possible nor desirable to simply address the  issue of unfit housing in isolation to the needs of those residents who would  be displaced as a result of the redevelopment activity. It is not a full  solution to solve one problem only to give birth to a new one. That was the  perspective of DSD and Margaret Ritchie on this matter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, back in February, when my predecessor announced  plans to develop social housing at the Girdwood site, she made it clear that  that would help to accommodate, if necessary, residents displaced by  regeneration activity in neighbouring parts of north Belfast. Plans to develop 200 social homes at  the Girdwood site will certainly help to rehouse residents who are displaced by  regeneration activity. Clearing that obstacle and creating certainty about the  future to that degree allowed DSD and Margaret Ritchie to focus on the final  efforts to agree the scale of redevelopment that was announced last week. Her  announcement has ended speculation and allowed residents to look forward to  what will happen with some clarity. The announcement created a certainty that  work would begin and allowed Margaret, in her last days as Minister, to honour  her promise to stand up for residents. Let us recognise that we now have an  approved set of plans that can take things forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Despite the very challenging economic climate and the  pressures already on the housing budget, with the prospect of further savings  having to be found, last week&rsquo;s announcement represents a long-term commitment  from my Department to the people of the Parkside, the Glen and the long  streets. To confirm that commitment, some &pound;7 million of funding has been  ring-fenced in the current financial year to allow work to start in each area  right away, although work will, obviously, have to be phased over several  years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That represents the start of a process that will transform  housing in the affected areas. Alongside our plans for Queen Victoria  Gardens &mdash; another redevelopment area in north Belfast &mdash; last week&rsquo;s announcement represents  an investment of &pound;38 million in the area. That investment will see 276 mostly  small and unfit homes demolished and replaced by 147 modern homes, which will  largely accommodate families &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I will in a second. Those homes will largely be for  family accommodation and will be built to modern standards in environmental  performance and sustainability.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  I thank the Minister for giving way. I was born and reared in the long streets,  and I am very proud to have lived there. Did I hear the Minister say that the  expenditure would start right away? I am not sure whether I picked up what he  said correctly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I can confirm that I said that work would start right  away. It will start right away in a number of ways. That leads me to address  the issues that were raised by Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n, who asked when proper  consultation will begin. My Department is already preparing information  leaflets to be distributed door to door so that people in the neighbourhood  know what is going to happen. I agree with Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n that the consultation  exercise must not consist of box-ticking.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There must be actual participation, because too often in  this jurisdiction, the outworking of a consultation is about ticking boxes and  is not about the full and proper participation of residents and other  communities in decision-making.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also confirm to Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n that I intend to bring a  paper to the Executive shortly to create further certainty about how we will  take forward the Girdwood proposals. It is my intention that there will be  decanting on to Girdwood from the properties that will be demolished. However,  whatever does or does not happen with Girdwood, decanting will be made  available in north Belfast  for the residents who will be affected by that demolition.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n also raised the issue of procurement, and the  housing association that is appointed to develop that work will take that  forward. I want to make it very clear, however, that one of my interests as  Minister for Social Development is to mainstream and embed social clauses much  more deeply in my own Department&rsquo;s procurement policies. If I can prevail on  other Ministers to do likewise with Government contracts, I will do so. Much  good work can be done in that area. I apologise that I will not be able to  address all the matters that Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n and other Members raised, but I  undertake to commit to write to Members in the very near future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Housing Executive will now start a conversation with  each community with the aim of agreeing an implementation plan to take that  work forward. That dialogue can begin at once. Just as the community had its  rightful say in what we would deliver, it will now have its rightful say in how  it will be delivered. Whatever the ungracious remarks that one Member made  about Margaret Ritchie, in my view, the grace and dignity that she brought to  social development and housing is a much more substantial and significant  message.</p>
