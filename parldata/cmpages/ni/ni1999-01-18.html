                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By virtue of paragraph&nbsp;1 of the schedule
                to the Northern Ireland (Elections) Act 1998 it falls to the
                Secretary of State to determine where meetings of the Assembly
                shall be held and when. I have received from the Secretary of
                State a letter directing that the Assembly shall meet at
                Parliament Buildings, Stormont at 10.30&nbsp;am on Monday
                18&nbsp;January until 6.00&nbsp;pm on Tuesday 26&nbsp;January.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Secretary of State has also indicated
                that she will consider a further direction in respect of this
                period, in particular in the light of any indications she
                receives as to the wishes of the Assembly after it has begun.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are two matters on which I need to
                rule. The first concerns Mr Ford’s request at the last sitting
                for a ruling as to whether language used by Mr Sammy Wilson
                about Prof Monica McWilliams was unparliamentary. I have
                considered the matter in some detail and have taken advice. The
                insinuation was undoubtedly discourteous and was regarded as
                such, and I again appeal to Members to observe courtesy.
                However, I cannot rule that the remark amounted to
                unparliamentary language, and therefore parliamentary discipline
                is not appropriate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second matter is that, having received an
                indication from four members of the United Kingdom Unionist
                Party that they had resigned from the UKUP and wished to form a
                new party, to be known as the Northern Ireland Unionist Party, I
                had to consider a number of issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first is whether their resignation from
                the United Kingdom Unionist Party affects their right to retain
                their seats in the Assembly. I have taken advice, and I am
                unaware of any legal impediment to their so doing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have considered a letter from the four
                Members and have obtained advice from my legal counsel and
                others. Since refusal to recognise the new party might well be
                contrary to article 11 of the European Convention on Human
                Rights and would probably be legally perverse in a situation
                where the party appears eligible and is likely to be registered
                under the Registration of Political Parties Act 1998, I have
                decided to recognise it with effect from last Friday, which was
                seven days after receipt of the information that I had requested
                to satisfy me on some important aspects.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What are the effects of such recognition?
                Will it affect the appointment of Ministers, Chairmen and Deputy
                Chairmen, using the d’Hondt formula? On this I am unable to
                make a ruling because I have not received from the Secretary of
                State all the relevant additional Initial Standing Orders. In
                addition, there are a number of practical matters which will
                need to be considered subsequent to recognition of the new
                party: accommodation, party funding, Committees, seating in the
                Chamber, speaking order, and so on. These matters are being
                addressed and will continue to be addressed over the next few
                weeks.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to draw Members’ attention to the
                new clocks that I have had installed in the Chamber. Normally
                they will display the time not only in hours and minutes but
                also in seconds. Members may wonder why I have taken this
                action. When a Member commences speaking, the clocks will become
                stop-clocks, and the Member — indeed, the Assembly as a whole
                — will be able to monitor the passing of time. I trust that
                this will help us all to adhere to the times stipulated in the
                Standing Orders.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr&nbsp;Presiding
                Officer. The Assembly is about to debate a report which purports
                to be based on an agreement between the First Minister
                (Designate) and the Deputy First Minister (Designate). Is the
                Assembly entitled to know if some of the elements in that report
                relate to conditions which are not contained in the report? The
                First Minister (Designate) sent a letter to a number of his
                party colleagues. This letter contained a number of indicators
                (some more express than others) that he had entered into certain
                aspects of the agreement on conditions — for example,</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Our agreement to 10 Departments is
                conditional on it being cost-neutral over the lifetime of the
                Assembly. This will be achieved by a thorough review of
                government and the elimination of undemocratic boards and
                quangos.&quot;</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Has the Deputy First Minister (Designate)
                agreed that there will be no cost in setting up 10 Departments,
                as opposed to six or seven, and what changes will be made to
                boards and quangos?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While there are some issues which have yet to
                be clarified — such as the presentation of legislation and the
                responsibilities of the Presiding Officer — I do not think
                that there is any matter in the substance of what the Member has
                said on which I am required to make a ruling as a point of
                order. There may be political aspects, and those can be debated.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly is being asked to approve what
                is described in this motion as a report. The Assembly — and
                the public — are being told that this report will become a
                determination on 15&nbsp;February&nbsp;1999 and that this has
                been agreed by the First Minister (Designate) and the Deputy
                First Minister (Designate). Will this report not necessitate the
                ruling of the Initial Presiding Officer that it requires a
                cross-community vote and not a simple vote? If a cabbage is
                described as a rose, it remains a cabbage. If this determination
                is described as a report, it remains a determination.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">May I try to clarify these matters as I
                understand them? The report fulfils the mandate that was given
                by the Assembly to the First Minister (Designate) and the Deputy
                First Minister (Designate) to bring forward a report by today. I
                have studied the report since I received it at the end of last
                week, and it seems clear to me that it is not a determination.
                If it is not a determination, it is required to be approved not
                by a cross-community vote but simply by a majority vote. This is
                the procedure unless, of course, a petition of concern is placed
                with me.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As far as the report’s becoming a
                determination is concerned, the Assembly should first study it
                in detail. Differences of view and problems may become apparent
                during this debate, and I assume that the First Minister
                (Designate) and the Deputy First Minister (Designate) will wish
                to take such matters into account when they consider the matter
                further.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This report, in itself, makes it clear that
                it is not a determination. The First Minister (Designate) and
                the Deputy First Minister (Designate) are required to submit a
                determination to the Assembly for approval — that is very
                clear from the Standing Orders. The determination, if and when
                it comes, will have to be submitted to the Assembly for
                approval, and a vote on this today could not possibly be
                regarded as an approval of the determination since the report
                makes it clear that it is not, in itself, a determination.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept your ruling, but may I humbly say
                that you seem to have overlooked the fact that people were told,
                by both the First Minister (Designate) and the Deputy First
                Minister (Designate), that the agreement which is embodied in
                what is today called a report will be in essence the
                determination which the said Ministers will put forward for the
                approval of the Assembly on 15 February. It would be a public
                scandal if today Members were to treat this as a report and not
                a determination and then the citizens of Northern Ireland were
                to discover that what had been treated as a report was exactly
                the same in essence as a determination approved by the Assembly
                by a cross-community vote on 15 February.</p>

                Mr&nbsp;McCartney. It is quite clear — but I repeat lest there
                be any misunderstanding — that this report cannot be regarded
                as a determination and therefore cannot be approved as a
                determination. If a determination is submitted on 15 February it
                will have to be discussed by the Assembly and voted upon.</p>

                Secretary of State on where her authority lies and where the
                authority of the Assembly might lie.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A determination can only be made by the First
                and Deputy First Ministers; not by a vote of the Assembly. When
                a determination is made it must be approved by the Assembly,
                otherwise it is not complete. Therefore, if we do not have a
                determination, it follows that whatever comes after this debate
                will have to be brought back to the Assembly for its
                consideration.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If I understand your penultimate words you
                are suggesting that, as the debate develops, it may become clear
                that this is more than a report — that it is a determination.
                As the debate develops, it may become apparent that all the
                requirements for a determination are set out in the report, in
                the sense that all the constituent parts required by law — the
                infrastructure and architecture for the 10 departments and the
                six cross-border implementation bodies and their functions —
                are present.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is it your ruling, despite it being an insult
                to the intelligence, that it can be anything else, that the
                First and Deputy First Ministers, by calling an elephant a
                snail, can make it a snail?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not sure about the analogies being drawn
                by the Member, but it is for the First and Deputy First
                Ministers to make determinations; not for me or the Assembly.
                However, it is important for voting purposes that I clarify
                whether a matter is a determination, since a cross-community
                vote is required for a determination.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First and Deputy First Ministers have
                made clear in their report that this is a not a determination.
                If, having taken soundings and heard the advice of the Assembly,
                they later determine that this report is the way forward, then
                they can make clear that this is their determination. But the
                report would have to come back to the Assembly for its approval
                before it could proceed further.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The position must be clear by now, and it can

                late last week. I was surprised that it took so long to
                finalise, and to get all of the details right, as its substance
                was in the public domain from 18&nbsp;December. I am also sorry
                that we did not quite get all the details right, as a
                typographical error at the foot of page 10 has remained
                undetected until a few minutes ago. The final consultations were
                on 2&nbsp;December; not 2&nbsp;November, as recorded.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is not a final report, because important
                matters regarding the British/Irish Council and the Civic Forum
                are outstanding. It is hoped to bring forward proposals on these
                by the target date which we have set. It is also not a final
                report because it does not meet the requirement of Standing

                or to a proposed central department or office under their joint

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some time after 18&nbsp;December we were
                informed by permanent secretaries that there were some functions
                which we had failed to allocate. I have a memorandum dated
                13&nbsp;January from the Head of the Northern Ireland Civil
                Service. It contains 26&nbsp;functions that we had failed to
                allocate. Some are straightforward, but others are more
                substantial. Consequently, there is no possibility of anyone
                construing this as a final report or as a determination.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We hope by 15 February — and that is a
                clear target — to sort out the detail on this, the
                British/Irish Council and the Civic Forum, and to bring forward
                a final report, with all the necessary determinations, which
                will then have to be approved on a cross-community basis. We
                have chosen 15&nbsp;February because we want to be in a position
                on or before 10&nbsp;March to have taken all the steps required
                to provide for devolution. We want to be in a position to say
                that we (by that I mean the Ulster Unionist Party, our
                colleagues in the SDLP — indeed, the Assembly as a whole) have
                done everything procedurally to ensure that devolution can take
                place on or after 10&nbsp;March.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will now clarify the choice of 10 March,
                which some members of the press are misinterpreting. The
                Secretary of State, in her schedule, identified it as a possible
                date for devolution because that is the date currently scheduled
                for the March meeting of the Privy Council. At the time of the
                Agreement we hoped to have devolution by February, since the
                date of the February meeting of the Privy Council is
                10&nbsp;February. Because of the time lost in October, with the
                delay in discussing North/South matters, we are not now in a
                position to hit 10&nbsp;February.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, even 10&nbsp;March is not absolutely
                settled as it is not entirely certain that the Privy Council
                will meet on that day, although it will be around that time. It
                is therefore important to be in a position to have all the
                necessary arrangements in place before 10&nbsp;March so that the
                possibility will then exist for actual devolution thereafter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A determination in the terms that have been
                used, whether today or on 15&nbsp;February, does not itself
                trigger the d’Hondt formula. Other things will have to be done
                in order for that to happen, in terms not just of what the
                Secretary of State does but also of what we are doing. This is
                not to say that there cannot be or will not be a shadow phase
                before the Assembly goes live. It is legally necessary for there
                to be a shadow period immediately before the transfer of
                functions because there has to be something to which functions
                can be transferred. Obviously we could not contemplate a shadow
                phase until everything is sorted out and we are ready to run.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When I talk about having everything ready I
                do not mean just the things that we have to do, such as these
                reports, the shepherding through of the legislation which will
                create the new Departments so that we can transfer functions to
                them, or our ensuring that the provisions of the treaties that
                will be entered into by the United Kingdom with the Republic of
                Ireland on areas of cross-border co-operation, along with the
                necessary legislation giving effect to those treaties, are
                drafted properly. Indeed, there are also approximately eight
                Orders in Council which we will have to ensure are done
                precisely and accurately. All this will involve much work by
                Members over the next month or so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But, in addition to the procedural
                requirements, there is that which might be described as a
                political requirement, although it is not. It is the fundamental
                requirement of the agreement itself — namely, that all those
                parties proposing to be involved in the Administration
                demonstrate clearly and unambiguously their commitment to the
                democratic process and to peaceable means. We all know what that
                involves and what has to be done in respect of that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have heard some Members state that there is
                no precondition for entry to the Executive. They may be right,
                but only in a very narrow, technical sense. A precondition is
                something that has to be satisfied before something else is
                done. It is a once-and-for-all act, and, having satisfied the
                precondition, one moves on to whatever it was a precondition
                for.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, with regard to the holding of
                office, there is something in the agreement that goes much
                further than a mere precondition. There is a fundamental
                requirement and a fundamental obligation. It is stated time and
                time again in the agreement — for instance, in the declaration
                of support on page one; on page seven where it refers to the
                formation of an Executive; on page nine with regard to
                transitional arrangements; and on page 10 with regard to the
                pledge of office — and there can be no doubt about it. It is a
                fundamental requirement that is being broken by
                paramilitary-related parties which refuse to carry out their
                obligation to deal with their weaponry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also being broken by
                paramilitary-related parties when they continue to engage in
                so-called punishment beatings and attacks. And let there be no
                doubt about the responsibility of people in this regard. The ‘Irish
                News’ editorial of 7 January, referring to the attacks of
                preceding days, said</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;In Nationalist districts there is
                little doubt that the attacks were the work of the IRA.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It also said</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;All the attacks were plainly in breach
                of both the IRA’s ceasefire and the Good Friday
                Agreement.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The attacks are also in breach of the
                requirements of the Mitchell principles whereby people accept
                responsibility for taking effective steps to prevent such
                actions. Furthermore, they undertake to renounce the use of
                force or threat of force and to oppose any effort by others to
                use force or to threaten force. But threats have been made in
                the last fortnight. Threats were made in a statement issued by
                the IRA, and exactly the same threat was made last Friday by Mr
                Martin McGuinness in an interview with ‘The Times’. I do not
                see him here today to explain to the Assembly why he is breaking
                the Mitchell principles and the agreement by uttering threats of
                violence.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I then heard that same person trying to avoid
                his responsibility on decommissioning by saying that it was a
                matter for John&nbsp;de Chastelain and not for others. It is a
                matter for him, and he, along with other people sitting
                opposite, has the power to do it. He undertook an obligation to
                do it, and he is now seven or eight months in default of that
                obligation. Let there be no doubt that there is a political
                requirement for that to be done. I regret to say that Sinn Fein
                is being assisted in dodging its obligations by people who call
                themselves Unionists. They need to reconsider their position.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am convinced that we can do it — more
                convinced that we must do it. Anyone who watched the two BBC
                programmes on the last two Saturday nights and got an insight
                into the pain and suffering of the two communities in Northern
                Ireland has got to be gauche and unfeeling not to realise the
                extent of the pain and suffering that we have gone through in
                the past 30 years. All of us, no matter how gauche, have a
                responsibility to ensure that that never happens again.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am certain that this agreement will not
                fail because of the anti-agreement parties. Yes, they have a
                point of view, and I, at least, do them the courtesy of trying
                to understand their point of view. We will hear it today in all
                of its manifestations, and it will be listened to with courtesy
                so that we can see what validity it has. If the agreement is not
                to succeed, it will be because of the collective failure of the
                pro-agreement parties — the SDLP, the UUP, Sinn Fein,
                Alliance, the PUP and the Women’s Coalition.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me recall what we all pledged ourselves
                to do on Good Friday in the Declaration of Support. We declared
                that the agreement offered a truly historic opportunity for a
                new beginning. Will history say that we took this opportunity,
                broke with the past and made a new start? We dedicated ourselves
                to reconciliation, tolerance and mutual trust. Have we shown
                those qualities? Have we promoted that reconciliation? Have we
                done it at all times and in all the ways that we should have
                done?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We reaffirmed our total and absolute
                commitment to exclusively democratic and peaceful means of
                resolving differences and our opposition to the use of the
                threat of force by others for political reasons. Have we left
                this issue hanging in the air, or has it become a tool of party
                politics?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We pledged to work to ensure the success of
                each of the institutions that have to be established. Have we
                shown the commitment and the necessary urgency in building the
                new arrangements and institutions? We should all ponder on those
                questions and look into our hearts and minds to see where the
                answers lie. These are the criteria by which we must evaluate
                ourselves because those are the criteria that will determine the
                ultimate success or failure of the agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Together today, irrespective of our
                differences, we can all renew the spirit of hope that was
                embodied in the Good Friday Agreement. That almost impossible
                faith in the triumph of truth, tolerance and peaceful
                coexistence over hatred, suspicion and communal division
                provides the opportunity to restructure our society and the way
                in which we live, something that was denied so many generations.
                Today we should cast our minds back to that commitment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On becoming Deputy First Minister
                (Designate), I took a solemn pledge of office. In particular, I
                pledged to discharge the duties of the office by serving all of
                the people of Northern&nbsp;Ireland equally. I accepted that the
                essence of the agreement is a partnership in which no side can
                expect to obtain its ultimate position. We left those positions
                behind when we signed the agreement. I accepted that partnership
                government will not work if every decision has to be resolved
                through brinkmanship. We have a choice: either we can be
                committed to the agreement or we can be condemned to failure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With these principles and commitments in
                mind, I commend the report for Members’ approval as an
                instrument designed to bring the process safely through to the
                concluding date of 10 March 1999. I would like briefly to
                explain some of its different elements and the reasoning that
                underlies it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the North-South bodies, I
                sought to obtain the greatest possible practical benefits for
                the people of Ireland, North and South. Yes, it was ambitious,
                but I believe in the benefits of a common approach to all of the
                major economic areas. But, like all Members, I must take account
                of others’ points of view and their reservations. Equally, I
                accept that the Assembly requires cross-community support on
                major issues. That is not something that can be invented or
                pulled out of a hat; that is one of the ultimate challenges, and
                that applies to both the North/South areas and the proposed
                Departments. What we have agreed about those Departments — and
                many people have expressed views on that — will be presented
                for the Assembly’s approval on 15&nbsp;February&nbsp;1999. In
                the meantime, work is now underway to agree the remits, budgets,
                staffing and programmes of work for the new institutions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the Assembly will agree the 10
                Departments when it meets on 15&nbsp;February 1999. One of the
                issues underlying the number that was agreed was the need to
                cater for maximum inclusion. We had to ensure that each party
                got a fair crack of the whip so that no one would be
                disadvantaged by any decision on their number.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask those who make utterances from a
                sedentary position to bear that in mind, for often it is those
                utterers who would not have Departments if fewer than 10 had
                been decided upon.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to primary responsibility for
                equality, it is self-evident that the office best placed to
                ensure the necessary cross-departmental monitoring is the Office
                of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister. There is,
                however, another very important fact.</p>

                out all the words after Assembly and add</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;rejects the report prepared by the
                First Minister (Designate) and the Deputy First Minister
                (Designate) and contends it is detrimental to the Union with
                Great Britain, does not provide for efficient structures of
                government, nor does it address the essential issue of
                decommissioning.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two papers were published last week — the
                report of the two Ministers and the timetable by the Secretary
                of State. But one thing was strangely missing from both: there
                was absolutely no mention of decommissioning. It is interesting
                that the First Minister (Designate) took much of his 10 minutes
                today to argue the case on decommissioning that he says his
                party adheres to. Yet there is not a line about decommissioning
                in this report — not one line.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 18&nbsp;December there was quite a furore
                that a wonderful agreement had been reached, and, of course,
                there were going to be implementation committees in the South of
                Ireland. Now, according to the agreement, the two Ministers had
                no right to take any decisions on those committees.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.15 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A decision on that could only have been taken
                by a North/South Ministerial Council. The First Minister
                (Designate) wrote to his party and said that he had defeated
                John&nbsp;Hume and Seamus&nbsp;Mallon and achieved agreement
                without forming the Executive. He added that he remains
                committed to the manifesto pledge not to sit in an Executive
                with unreconstructed terrorists despite attempts at browbeating
                by the SDLP.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister (Designate):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At least they listened.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister (Designate) may be
                prepared to travel in a plane with hijackers, but he cannot
                expect us to join him. Only a fool would travel in such a plane.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The paper written by the First Minister
                (Designate) reveals what was really happening. They thought that
                they could get this through, but they discovered that they were
                completely outside the law. The report recommends that the
                North/South Ministerial Council consider what has been said.
                That is not what was said originally. The North/South bodies are
                free-standing bodies. That is not what the Ulster Unionist Party
                said in its manifesto. A Minister will only have to make a
                statement about any decision he has taken. The Assembly will
                only have a say in matters concerning money.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This report is an attempt to weaken the
                Union. It does not provide efficient structures of government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I listened with interest to the Deputy First
                Minister (Designate). He said that they wanted to widen it and
                hence they wanted 10 seats. He did not want to widen it for
                those Members who are not in a majority. It was nothing to do
                with Unionists in small groups — he wanted to bring in
                IRA/Sinn Fein.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hear Mr&nbsp;McGrady saying that it was to
                get the Democratic Unionist Party in, but if there had been a
                seven-seat Executive, we would have been entitled to a seat —
                indeed, if there had been a three-seat Executive, under d’Hondt
                the DUP would have had a seat. Let not Mr&nbsp;McGrady pretend
                that he was thinking of the DUP, for we know perfectly well that
                there were no such generous thoughts in his heart. His thoughts
                were for IRA/Sinn Fein, his fellow travellers in the Nationalist
                camp. He was eager to get them in. The reason for having 10
                seats is simply to get the IRA its place on the central
                committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to decommissioning, if it is so
                important, then why did the First Minister (Designate) not get
                something written in? Even if there were a disagreement between
                himself and Mr&nbsp;Mallon, each could have put his case and his
                arguments — this is only a report. Why are we not dealing with
                that issue in this report? The reason is that after the decision
                is made today it is only a matter of form as to when we return.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are moving forward. Although the Ulster
                Unionists have said that we are only marking time, the First
                Minister (Designate) has told me that he is making progress.
                Progress on what road? He is not on the Union road; he is not on
                a road that will give us a Government that will maintain the
                Union.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this most interesting report, the First
                Minister (Designate) has nothing to say about the members of the
                Unionist family who do not agree with him, except that we are
                hypocritical and dishonest. I am glad to know what he thinks of
                us. He seems to think that the SDLP is very honest and that he
                will be able to do a deal with Sinn Fein eventually. But he
                thinks that the rest of the Unionist family are dishonest
                hypocrites.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The vote today will show how thin his grip on
                the Unionist community is. He is clearly in great difficulty if
                he has to threaten to withdraw the Whip from his own Members to
                secure their votes. On a television programme last week called
                ‘The Cutting Edge’, I heard that he had a wafer-thin
                majority. That majority will go like snow off a ditch if he
                pursues the policy of a united Ireland, which is written into
                this report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those who endorse this post-dated cheque
                today will pay, but there are people in Northern Ireland who are
                not prepared to pay for this sell-out, and they will resist it.
                I say to the Deputy First Minister (Designate) that we are not
                riding on his plane.</p>

                Democratic Unionist Party is the only Unionist party that has
                said that it will sit in an Executive with Sinn Fein without
                decommissioning.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The other interesting thing he said was that
                the First Minister (Designate) had threatened our Members with
                disciplinary action. Can Dr Paisley confirm that all DUP
                candidates signed a letter for him confirming that they were
                signing up to certain positions? He did not trust their word; he
                had to get them to sign letters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issues are simple. I vividly recall that
                in September the Democratic Unionist Party said that the
                Ministers had presented a weak report without determination. Now
                it says that our final report is a post-dated cheque and it is
                terrible.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of those who dish out criticism and
                abuse do not like listening to people criticising them. That is
                the problem that confronts us. We are in danger of losing the
                main plot which is about whether people are genuinely committed
                to the democratic process. Are people committed, as they are
                required to be by the agreement, to opposing the use of and the
                threat of force? Judging by current happenings in the community,
                there is little evidence of that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been a huge upsurge in punishment
                beatings since the beginning of the year. Such beatings have
                reached record levels, and people are trying to make an issue of
                the acceptability of the police because of the operation of the
                Patten Commission. People perceive a vacuum, and all these
                factors show that some people are not genuinely committed to
                exclusively peaceful means.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we do nothing else in this Assembly, we
                should ensure that those in government are demonstrably
                committed to such means. That is the key issue. While the
                different strands of Unionism can argue the toss, at the end of
                the day that is the issue that will determine whether this
                process succeeds or fails. It is designed to provide a path for
                those who have followed a paramilitary route in the past so that
                they may enter a political process that is exclusively committed
                to peaceful means. If people are not prepared to do that, it
                means that they are not committed and cannot therefore be
                required or permitted to enter government. It is as simple as
                that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The community has been generous in its
                tolerance of what has gone on here for many years. It tolerates
                the release of prisoners and action on other issues over which
                local parties do not have direct control. Such matters are under
                the control of the Secretary of State. We must look at the
                opportunities because we all want power to be devolved to
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland. We want the opportunity that we have not
                had for more than a generation. We want to work effectively for
                our constituents in the delivery of social services, jobs and
                housing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Until now we have been spectators in our own
                country, watching from the sidelines as somebody flies in to
                determine policy. In other forums and councils we have said,
                &quot;Isn’t it terrible what the Government are doing?&quot;
                We have complained about decisions on hospitals, schools, houses
                and jobs. We have the opportunity in two months’ time to
                decide for ourselves, and we must establish the firm foundations
                for that to continue.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The firm foundation is that those who aspire
                to exercise power must be committed totally and exclusively to
                peaceful means. That has to be demonstrated and maintained; it
                is not a one-off. If we are in government with a gun to our
                heads, metaphorically speaking, the trust that is needed
                successfully to govern the people of Northern&nbsp;Ireland
                cannot be created. We would look like hypocrites, and would
                lurch from one crisis to another.</p>

                People want that, although some argue that there will be a
                surrender. The issue is not about surrender. It is about genuine
                change which we must make and which this Assembly represents.
                Despite all the noise, everybody here has changed and will
                continue to change because not long ago we came through various
                processes to bring us to this point. Some fought their way here
                through the polls while others abused the system by using a
                ballot box and Armalite strategy, but we are all here because we
                cannot afford not to be.</p>

                a comment. We have to show compassion because anyone who has
                been deprived for over a month of the attentions of Cedric
                Wilson and Paddy Roche would make such comments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The opportunity should not be lost. People
                who feel that the destruction of weapons by one means or another
                weakens their position or makes them any less Loyalist or
                Republican have not fully embraced the democratic process. If
                they have, they do not need those weapons for any reason other
                than to threaten. The agreement has produced every conceivable
                mechanism to protect rights and equality. What more evidence of
                inequality could there be than somebody barging into a person’s
                house and smashing his limbs with iron bars and baseball bats?
                That is inequality in its most virulent form.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The law has never been stronger. We are
                setting up all sorts of mechanisms, such as commissions and
                bodies for the proofing of legislation. Never in the history of
                any community in western Europe has more been done to ensure
                that everybody gets a fair crack of the whip. Everybody will
                have an opportunity to have a say and will have access to the
                law if an authority fails to do its job properly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People must be confident that there is change
                and a determination to implement the new arrangements fairly. If
                there are failures, there must be adequate mechanisms to ensure
                that individuals, Ministers and authorities are corrected and
                prevented from doing anything which is to the disadvantage of
                any citizen. This array of apparatus presents the opportunity to
                take the step that is needed and to bring about genuine
                confidence. I hope that the House will take that step.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the resolutions were passed on previous
                occasions from 1&nbsp;July&nbsp;1988 onwards, the First Minister
                (Designate) and the Deputy First Minister (Designate) were
                criticised for not presenting a report of the type that is now
                before the Assembly. As party members, we know the toil and
                sweat which has gone into this report, and it should not be
                dismissed lightly or allowed to fall between the stools of
                inter-party rivalry. That would serve no purpose, and certainly
                not the purpose of the people who sent us here. We often forget
                that we are here on behalf of the people. They have asked us to
                come to the Assembly to reach agreement on that which they have

                seem to be able to understand what is being said. I have
                experienced that in many places and on many occasions. To me,
                the concepts of majority and minority are viable and acceptable.
                The purpose of our debates is to ensure the fullest possible
                diversity so as to create the fullest possible partnership.
                Partnership in any field can be nurtured only if there is the
                mutual trust and confidence that will enable it to prosper. The
                report designates the broad concepts on which the governance of
                Northern Ireland could be achieved in a much better way than
                hitherto.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People may jibe about numbers. The SDLP was
                not the only party to recommend 10&nbsp;Departments. Almost
                every party in the Chamber, on a cross-community basis,
                recommended that number. The Democratic Unionist Party has often
                said that it did not see any great disadvantage in having 10
                Departments. That party is on record as saying that several
                years would be required to determine whether it was right to
                have 10 Departments. I hope that the DUP will not now advance
                some altruistic argument for having fewer than 10 Departments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The arrangement of the disciplines within the
                10&nbsp;Departments should ensure the most effective delivery of
                services and must address the economic and social concerns of
                our people. Ten is not magic or immutable, but it is the best
                number for delivering that which has to be delivered.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask Members to look at the disciplines that
                are listed under each Department. While there may be
                disagreements over individual aspects, we trust that there is
                broad agreement that such an arrangement is the best vehicle for
                delivering the economic, social and cultural aspirations of
                everyone in Northern Ireland. I urge the House to support the
                motion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The vote on departmental structures is an
                important milestone in the move towards establishing new regimes
                of government in which as many as possible of the elected
                representatives will participate not just at executive level but
                also in the Committees, the Chairmanships, the
                Vice-Chairmanships and as Members of the Assembly. Under these
                proposals, Northern Ireland will have the most democratic and
                most accountable form of government that any country has ever
                had.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given time, these novel, unique and most
                democratic structures, could well become a blueprint for other
                communities and other countries to follow, especially where
                there is racial, cultural or religious conflict. This would be a
                great blueprint for the resolution of difference and for the
                acceptance of diversity and would work for the good of the
                community that we are all trying to serve.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the pre-Easter Friday we had an agreement.
                On the pre-Christmas Friday we had an agreement. I hope that
                before the next Easter Day arrives we will have in place a new
                Government that will serve all the people of Northern Ireland.
                We are capable of achieving this. There is inter-party
                antagonism, which is understandable and quite legitimate, but I
                appeal to Members not to use this process for party
                point-scoring.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is easy to score party points or to be
                negative but there is nothing positive in such behaviour. While
                some Members were involved in bilaterals, trilaterals and
                multilaterals, those Members who oppose the Good Friday
                Agreement and who reject the will of the people of Northern
                Ireland did not make one constructive proposal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have not heard one constructive proposal
                from parties opposed to the agreement. Presumably they will
                oppose this report. Not one constructive alternative proposal
                has been put on the Table because these Members are
                concentrating on petty political point-scoring. They are
                sacrificing the good governance of this community to their own
                selfish party-political interest. Mr Paisley said that the
                people will pay. The people who are going to pay for
                failing&nbsp;to deliver the agreement are the people who are

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.45 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Sinn Fein leadership, reluctantly and
                after considerable discussion, has had to accept that the UUP
                has been able, once again, to buy time. In many ways, this has
                become the character of this process, and it is disappointing,
                not least because the report on the matters referred to the
                Assembly by the British Secretary of State was first dealt with
                on 1 July 1998.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not have the time or the inclination to
                take us through every turn of the road in the frustratingly slow
                effort to produce this report. There is absurdity in the Ulster
                Unionist Party’s proclamation of a deal on 18&nbsp;December
                and in its refusal to recommend that deal for determination
                today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is clear that it was Seamus&nbsp;Mallon’s
                intention to have a proper report for determination today. It is
                equally clear that that is what Mr Trimble, the First Minister,
                refused to do. Sinn Fein is not convinced that this hesitancy is
                a result of the barracking and bluster of the DUP or the UK
                Unionist Party, or whatever it now calls itself. Our view is
                that, despite all the noise, the differences among the main
                Unionist parties are tactical.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That should not be the case; there should be
                clear strategic and tactical differences among pro- and
                anti-agreement Unionists. But because of the way the leadership
                of the Ulster Unionist Party has managed the process, there has
                yet to emerge, even today, a clear Unionist political formation
                which is prepared to bring in, voluntarily and with good grace,
                the type of changes that are involved in the Good Friday
                Agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Trimble had some interesting things to say
                in the debate, and I am glad that he has at last recognised that
                Sinn Fein was correct in its analysis of the Good Friday
                Agreement, and particularly on the lack of preconditions on the
                issue of decommissioning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore, Mr Trimble delays once again,
                perhaps in the futile hope that he can get the two Governments
                to acquiesce in his game-plan on the pretext of a spurious
                notion of preconditions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The agreement has clear timetables and a
                clear chronology for the establishment of the various
                institutions, without preconditions. Therefore, the report may
                delay the inevitable, but it cannot prevent the inevitable. I
                welcome the section which promises a final report, with
                associated procedural motions, to be submitted here on
                15&nbsp;February to facilitate the transfer of power by London
                and Dublin by 10&nbsp;March.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to deal with the substance of the deal
                of 18&nbsp;December. Sinn Fein has, for some time, made it clear
                that it believes that the UUP would have to agree to
                10&nbsp;Ministries. That was the case, and it is a good
                development. For the first time — and we can hear the
                protestation from the unreconstructed wing of Unionism — there
                is numerical equality in the exercise of political power between
                Nationalist and Unionist in the North. That is a good
                development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the rejection of a powerful
                Ministry, not just by the Ulster Unionist Party, but also by the
                SDLP, to tackle the core issue of equality is a major sop to
                Unionism. I have asked some of my colleagues to deal separately
                with the issue of Departments, but I take this opportunity to
                reiterate our support for a Ministry to deal with children, a
                matter that could be addressed by the appointment of a junior
                Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The recent negotiations were also to
                establish dynamic and powerful all-Ireland structures as
                envisaged in the Good Friday Agreement. We now have six
                all-Ireland structures — some of which are significant — but
                Sinn Fein retains considerable reservations about the outcome of
                these negotiations, especially the exclusion of inward
                investment from the all-Ireland business and trade body, and the
                debacle on tourism.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We entered these negotiations in good faith.
                For us the priority was strategic and political. We wanted to
                ensure that the legislative timetable required by the two
                Governments was kept and that the UUP did not succeed in its
                short-term aim of limiting the potential of the all-Ireland
                aspects of the agreement. We wanted to clear away the
                undergrowth and move towards the formation of an Executive that
                would include Unionist, SDLP and Sinn Fein membership.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With this in mind, Sinn Fein held a series of
                bilaterals with the Irish Government in the summer followed by
                trilaterals involving the Irish Government, ourselves and the
                SDLP. Sinn Fein also held meetings with the British Government
                and with the First Minister (Designate) and the Deputy First
                Minister (Designate).</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been my party’s consistent view that
                the British Government have a special responsibility to ensure
                that the Good Friday Agreement is implemented. We called,
                therefore, on a number of occasions for the British Prime
                Minister to be directly involved. Members will recall that he
                presided over a series of meetings on the evening of
                2&nbsp;December, that a deal was done, and that that deal was
                then reneged on by the Ulster Unionist Party with
                John&nbsp;Taylor memorably advising everyone to take a holiday.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also have considerable reservations on
                aspects of how the negotiations were conducted, and I have put
                these firmly on the record with everyone involved. In the 36
                hours or so of the negotiations leading to the 18&nbsp;December
                deal, the UUP refused to engage in trilaterals with Sinn Fein
                and the SDLP even though, under the terms of the Good Friday
                Agreement, these three parties and the DUP were entitled to be
                involved in such discussions. The negotiations became
                convoluted, but because of Sinn Fein’s priorities, as outlined
                earlier, we remained engaged in spite of the difficulties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, in the early hours of Friday,
                18&nbsp;December, Sinn Fein was cut out of the engagement.
                Martin McGuinness, our team of senior negotiators and I were
                left sitting in the office while Eddie&nbsp;McGrady and David
                Trimble clinched their deal and announced it to the media.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not bringing this to the attention of
                the Assembly with personal or political rancour. I am drawing
                attention to it to highlight the pitfalls of tolerating, or
                acquiescing in, the politics of exclusion. The parties entitled
                to Ministerial positions by virtue of their electoral mandates
                should have been fully involved in the negotiations and the
                final agreement; this did not happen.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wrote to the First and Deputy First
                Ministers (Designate) before Christmas expressing this view and
                how, in particular, the negotiations had excluded many parties,
                not just Sinn Fein. I was most critical of the fact that those
                parties entitled to Ministerial office were not fully involved.
                I requested that this view be reflected in today’s report; I
                note that they have failed to do that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In summary, Sinn Fein would have preferred
                that the report set up the Executive and other institutions in
                shadow form. Sinn Fein welcomes the commitment to do this in the
                final report, so, while underpinning our reservations on some of
                the issues, we welcome the progress that has been made.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Táimid mí-shásta, mar a dúirt mé, lena
                lán rudaí sa tuarascáil seo, ach dá ainneoin sin, támid ag
                dul a vótáil ar a son: nó tá dáta cinnte inti nuair a
                bhéas David Trimble ag déanamh moltaí, agus tá Sinn Féin
                sásta leis sin.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Chathaoirligh, one thing is certain. Unless
                the Unionist parties, and in particular the Ulster Unionist
                Party, can get the two Governments to abandon the Good Friday
                Agreement — which I think is most unlikely — the next steps
                towards implementing the agreement, steps which should already
                have been taken, are clearly visible. The Executive must be
                established; the all-Ireland Ministerial Council must be set up;
                and the other institutions must be put in place. There is talk
                of minorities and majorities; 85% of the people of this island
                gave voice to their dream of a new future with peace and
                justice. The Good Friday Agreement is a critical part of the
                process of bringing that about.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Initial Presiding
                Officer. At the outset the arrangement was that if someone used
                a language other than English then a translation would be
                offered. Towards the end of Mr Adams’s speech there were some
                words which I presume were in Irish, in the course of which I
                clearly heard my name mentioned. I might have wanted to comment
                on what was being said about me, but a translation was not
                offered. Consequently, I and other Members who do not speak
                Irish are at a disadvantage when referred to personally when we
                cannot understand what is being said. It is, at the very least,
                extremely discourteous.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From the beginning I have appealed to
                Members, if using a language other than English, to offer a
                translation. I cannot require that as a Standing Order at this
                point. It is, however, a matter of courtesy, especially if, in
                the course of using a language other than English, a Member’s
                name is mentioned. There is a convention that in certain
                circumstances the Member may have an opportunity to reply.
                Therefore I appeal to all Members to please live by that
                courtesy.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Adams:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I intended no discourtesy, and I apologise to
                Mr Trimble if he feels that in some way I have been discourteous
                towards him. There is, of course, a huge argument for having
                simultaneous translation, which would get over this problem. It
                is difficult in the time allowed for people like myself to
                condense what we have said into English. I would have preferred
                to make more of my speech in Irish.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I said —</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot allow you to repeat it in English.
                That would be out of order. I cannot permit a Member on a point
                of order to then subsequently give a translation. That could be
                regarded as a way of creating extra time. Mr Adams has said that
                he did not intend any discourtesy, and that is welcome. With
                regard to the matter of simultaneous translation, that is not a
                question for me. I can only work through the Standing Orders
                that are provided. For the information of Members, the Committee
                on Standing Orders has already indicated that it wishes to
                address the issue.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a further point of order. What I said in
                Irish is what I said earlier in English. Mr&nbsp;Trimble was in
                conversation with some of his colleagues and may not have heard
                that.</p>
                <b>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I had hoped that the vote that we will be
                taking at the end of this debate would have been a determination
                vote. The Alliance Party is very much committed, not only to
                making the agreement work, but also to making the Assembly work.
                If this buys time to allow the process to move forward we are
                prepared to go along with that. It is important that the vote
                taken on 15 February is a vote of determination, that there is a
                full report from the First Minister (Designate) and Deputy First
                Minister (Designate) which will allow the Assembly to move
                forward to full devolution.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last month the Alliance Party put forward an
                amendment in the Assembly, which was defeated. It called for the
                First Minister (Designate) and Deputy First Minister (Designate)
                to come to an agreement on departmental structures in Northern
                Ireland and on North/South bodies. I welcome the fact that they
                have now delivered and that they have agreed to
                10&nbsp;Departments in Northern Ireland, although I do have some
                reservations about some of the other issues that were agreed
                upon. I had hoped that there would have been a separate
                department for equality and community relations, but that has
                now gone to the centre. I had hoped that tourism would have been
                included with heritage, arts and sport, but that has not
                happened.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I had hoped that a department would be
                created for external affairs to deal with the important issues
                relating to Europe among others, but that has not happened.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am looking for assurances from the First
                Minister (Designate) and the Deputy First Minister (Designate)
                that scrutiny committees will be set up to oversee equality,
                community relations and Europe and that the Assembly will have
                the opportunity to scrutinise these very important issues. It is
                important that that matter be clarified.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some thought must now be given to the make-up
                of the Committees of the Assembly. Under the Initial Standing
                Orders only a limited number of people can be appointed to them.
                The Standing Orders Committee needs to meet very soon to ensure
                that all Members are involved in the process. It is important
                too that the parties identify the people who will become
                Ministers and Chairmen or Vice-Chairmen of the Committees. The
                period between now and 15&nbsp;February should be used to work
                out what is happening in this respect. I urge both the British
                and Irish Governments to pursue, with the utmost vigour, the
                legislative mechanisms so that by 10&nbsp;March everything is
                ready for power to be devolved to the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the 31&nbsp;October deadline was missed
                a major opportunity for the Assembly was also missed, and the
                delay that missing that deadline created has brought problems
                for many people here. That is why the 15&nbsp;February deadline
                must not be missed. The reason for this deadline is to allow the
                Secretary of State to move forward with the Orders in Council to
                ensure that the 10&nbsp;March deadline is not missed. I am
                pleased that these deadlines have been established, but it is
                essential that they are not missed — missed deadlines have
                resulted in missed opportunities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I turn to the sensitive issue of
                decommissioning. It is nine months since the Good Friday
                Agreement was reached in Castle Buildings. The onus is on
                Republican and Loyalist groups to start the process of
                decommissioning. I accept what the Agreement says, and there
                have been a number of confidence-building measures on the parts
                of all of us involved in the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I call upon the leadership of Republican and
                Loyalist paramilitary groupings to take the confidence-building
                measures that will build the trust which is required to move the
                process forward. This is a very serious issue and one that has
                to be addressed. We only have to look at the events since the
                start of the year — the escalation of paramilitary beatings
                and shootings. These are being carried out openly by Republicans
                and Loyalists. If we are to create a truly peaceful, democratic
                society in Northern Ireland, these barbarities have to stop.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the DUP’s amendment — no
                surprise there. Over the years we have come to expect the DUP to
                say &quot;No&quot;. We would be disappointed if it did not, and
                this amendment comes as no surprise whatsoever. There are many
                problems in society in Northern Ireland at present. There is a
                crisis in the Health Service — a major crisis. I ask if
                Members of the Assembly are afraid to take responsibility for
                dealing with important day-to-day issues? I do not believe that
                any individual Member is afraid. The sad irony is that the
                anti-agreement constituency is just as keen to see the transfer
                of powers to the Assembly as those in favour of the agreement,
                but they cannot have their cake and eat it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The peace process means having to take risks.
                All the parties have problems with the process, and it suits
                some of them to say no, but it is hypocritical of some Members
                to reap all the benefits of the agreement, while letting others
                take all the risks. It is a sad reflection on those Members here
                who are trying to hold back the process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to see the agreement implemented in
                full with the setting up of the North/South Ministerial Council,
                the British-Irish Council and the very important Civic Forum. It
                is time for the Assembly’s pro-agreement parties to regroup.
                We obviously want to bring the entire Assembly with us as we
                move closer to the full devolution of powers. But evil forces
                —out to destroy the agreement and the Assembly — are at
                work, and there is an onus on all of us to have a fully working,
                devolved Assembly in place by the end of March 1999 at the
                latest. That is what the people of Northern Ireland want, and
                they said so loudly and clearly in last year’s referendum.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report is the negotiated detail of the
                Belfast Agreement. It merely confirms the fundamental
                characteristics of that agreement as a radical corruption of
                democratic practice and the rule of law, and a massive
                concession to the demands of Irish Nationalism on the part of
                the UUP negotiators. This is most evident in relation to the
                provisions for the governance of Northern Ireland as set out in
                the report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The UUP negotiators have capitulated to the
                Nationalist demand for an Executive with 10&nbsp;Departments,
                which maximises the number of Sinn&nbsp;Fein seats and creates
                an Executive which is evenly split between Nationalists and
                Unionists. This even split is simply a recipe for deadlock and
                for ensuring that pragmatic policy-making in areas such as the
                economy will be subordinate to the demands of a Nationalist
                ideology that is literally divorced from social and economic
                reality on the island of Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But far worse than any of these practical
                considerations is that by agreeing to an Executive with
                10&nbsp;Departments the UUP negotiators have maximised the
                extent to which the decent, law-abiding citizens of Northern
                Ireland will be governed by the architects of the terrorism that
                has been directed against them for 30&nbsp;years. This will be
                the case should the Assembly vote to accept the package being
                presented today. This terrorist strategy is based on a
                combination of the armalite and the ballot box, set out by
                Mr&nbsp;Adams in his book, ‘The Politics of Irish Freedom’,
                in which he elaborated the strategic understanding that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The tactic of armed struggle is of
                primary importance because it provides a vital cutting edge.
                Without it, the issue of Ireland would not be an issue … armed
                struggle has been an agent for bringing about change … At the
                same time there is a realisation in Republican circles that
                armed struggle on its own is inadequate and that non-armed forms
                of political struggle are at least as important.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Between 1988 and 1992 the leadership of the
                SDLP forged an alliance with Sinn Fein/IRA that strengthened
                immensely the political dimension of Mr&nbsp;Adams’s dual
                strategy but did not in any way blunt the vital cutting edge of
                IRA terrorism.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This armalite-and-ballot-box strategy was
                given international legitimacy by the Mitchell Report, which
                proposed taking the gun out of Irish politics by a political
                settlement that would obviously have to be agreeable to those
                who were committed to the use of the gun. Consequently,
                terrorists would have to be represented in the negotiations.
                This was facilitated in the Mitchell Report by establishing the
                fiction that representatives of terrorist organisations could
                authentically commit themselves to the principles of democracy
                and non-violence, while the organisations they represent retain
                their arsenals entirely intact.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This fiction is, of course, a radical
                corruption of the language of democratic politics which the UUP
                negotiators permitted to be incorporated into the core of the
                Belfast Agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report presented today involves massive
                concessions to both dimensions of Mr Adams’s dual strategy.
                That dimension of Mr Adams’s strategic thinking which he
                designates &quot;non-armed forms of political struggle&quot; has
                been accommodated by the UUP leadership’s agreeing that Sinn
                Fein may have two seats in the Executive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This arrangement is described in the report
                as the best possible form of government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Contrary to what the First Minister
                (Designate) and the Deputy First Minister (Designate) have
                commended to the Assembly today, any civilised individual could
                not regard a Government which included Sinn Fein — even if the
                IRA were to decommission its terrorist arsenal — as anything
                other than something not far removed (if removed at all) from
                the worst possible form of government, rather than the best.
                Such a government should not even be contemplated, never mind
                negotiated, by representatives of the pro-Union community in
                Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister (Designate) has not only
                the political effrontery to describe an Executive which will
                include two members of Sinn Fein/IRA as the best possible form
                of government, but he commends this arrangement as being
                necessary so that we can put behind us what the report refers to
                as &quot;the tragic years of trauma and separation.&quot;</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But what caused the trauma and separation of
                the past 30 years? Certainly not the absence of a so-called best
                possible form of government in Northern Ireland, which is what
                the report clearly implies, but a barbarity within Irish
                Nationalism devoid of any humane constraint. The words
                &quot;trauma and separation&quot; do not in any case remotely
                capture the impact of Republican terrorism on those directly
                affected. These words were chosen deliberately in order to
                deflect any focus on the barbarity and culpability of those for
                whom this report provides two places on the Executive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How does the report accommodate the armalite
                dimension of Mr Adams’s strategic thinking? The UUP
                negotiators capitulated to the armalite dimension when they
                negotiated the Belfast Agreement which does not require the
                decommissioning of the IRA’s terrorist arsenal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The UUP leader disputes this interpretation
                of the Belfast Agreement but the UUP leadership has failed to
                act on the basis of its own understanding of the agreement. The
                report presented today does not mention the word
                &quot;decommissioning&quot;. This means that in the negotiations
                since 1&nbsp;July&nbsp;1998 the UUP leadership has totally
                failed to give substance to its interpretation of the Belfast
                Agreement by negotiating a requirement for the IRA to
                decommission prior to Sinn&nbsp;Fein’s taking seats in the
                Executive. Therefore the First Minister (Designate) and the
                Deputy First Minister (Designate) are today presenting, for the
                approval of the Assembly, a report which meets the core
                requirement of Sinn Fein/IRA strategic thinking set out by Mr
                Adams in ‘The Politics of Irish Freedom’.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But that is not the end of the story. What
                has been presented to us today is the agreed outcome of
                negotiations on the all-Ireland aspect of the Belfast Agreement.
                The fact that the UUP leadership capitulated to the Nationalist
                demand for an Executive representing 10 Departments also means
                that the Nationalist input into the all-Ireland dimension of the
                agreement will be maximised.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The purpose of the North/South Ministerial
                Council and the associated all-Ireland implementation body is
                not to provide for mutually beneficial, pragmatic co-operation
                between Northern Ireland and the Republic. The real political
                rationale of the all-Ireland dimension of the agreement is to
                give expression to what the Deputy First Minister (Designate)
                constantly refers to as &quot;the Nationalist sense of
                identity&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Nationalist sense of identity, in
                political terms, is determined by a commitment to the political
                unification of the island of Ireland. This means that if the
                North-South Ministerial Council and the associated all-Ireland
                implementation body are to give authentic expression to what the
                Deputy First Minister (Designate) understands by the Nationalist
                sense of identity, these institutions must act as mechanisms to
                bring about the conditions of an all-Ireland state.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report presented to the Assembly is the
                negotiated detail of these all-Ireland mechanisms. The key
                feature of the report is that there is an all-Ireland dimension
                attached to each Ministerial portfolio in the Executive. This
                means that the report has firmly established the institutional
                arrangements required to develop the all-Ireland aspect of the
                policy of each of the 10 Ministerial portfolios. This is
                reinforced by the Belfast Agreement which states that each
                Minister can take decisions in the North/South Ministerial
                Council within his or her defined area of authority without the
                approval of the Assembly.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No, I will not give way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This means that the Assembly has virtually no
                effective control over the decisions of Ministers in the
                North/South Ministerial Council, which is the core mechanism to
                bring about the political and administrative structures to which
                the Deputy First Minister (Designate) refers as Irish unity. The
                combination of the detail of the report together with the
                inter-governmental conference means that the Republic would have
                de facto joint authority over Northern&nbsp;Ireland in the event
                of this report being approved by the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No Unionist could possibly accept the content
                of the report by the First Minister (Designate) and the Deputy
                First Minister (Designate) because the report demonstrates
                clearly that the UUP leadership has negotiated the detail of the
                Belfast Agreement in a manner that strengthens both the armalite
                and the ballot-box dimensions of Sinn Fein/IRA strategy. At the
                same time, the UUP leadership has agreed to the detail of the
                all-Ireland institutions to which Nationalists are committed as
                a mechanism to bring about what they call Irish unity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The rejection of this report by those
                authentically committed to the Union cannot be delayed. The
                report to be submitted to the Assembly on 15&nbsp;February will
                differ from this report only with respect to incidental detail.
                This means that the vote on this report is the substantive vote
                which will determine the future of the Union.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is one of the most important days in the
                history of Northern&nbsp;Ireland. Unionists are now being
                presented with perhaps the last opportunity to stop an
                appeasement of terrorism directed towards the destruction of the
                Union, and there is therefore only one course of action
                available to those who are committed to the Union — rejection
                of the report.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Things were funny earlier on, yet when the
                Leader of Sinn Fein was speaking, everything became much more
                grave. There was silence from the DUP benches. A degree of
                credibility was afforded to Mr&nbsp;Adams that people outside
                would wish to know about. I wonder if the media are prepared to
                report it. There have been a number of things that the media
                have been prepared to ignore or to slant.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">December 18 was hailed as a great day — a
                day when the SDLP and the Ulster Unionists created a wonderful
                agreement. They did it in the early hours of the morning, and
                they did it on what, we are told, was another wonderful Friday.
                Then, last Friday, the media described it — <i>[Interruption]</p>

                compromise broke out at Stormont — what a joke. In October,
                the Progressive Unionist Party flagged up difficulties with the
                agreement and with trying to implement all of its facets. Some
                laughed at us, and some took great succour and comfort from the
                fact that, for the first time, the Progressive Unionist Party
                was being negative about the agreement. Mr&nbsp;Taylor’s
                assertion that there is a 50% chance of success is, I believe,
                irrationally optimistic, and that brings me to those who will
                have fun and enjoyment out of hearing me say how it will be.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This agreement is going down. It is going
                down because of the macho men on both sides who did not look for
                opportunities for choreography, who simply pandered to their own
                constituencies, who made it difficult for each other.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hear people suggesting that the
                pro-agreement campaigners should stick together. They must be
                joking. The reality is that the macho men, demanding something
                which they know they cannot have and then getting upset when
                they cannot have it, have created circumstances wherein the
                other macho men have severely damaged the integrity of those in
                the Unionist community who advocated the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They did so by saying &quot;Do you not know
                who we are? Do you not realise that the last time anybody asked

                at Canary Wharf?&quot; Do they not realise the damage that does?
                Do they have any concept of how it looks when, at Christmas,
                people doing a bit of shopping find there is a horde of what

                sends into a Unionist community who, as Members well know, have
                their detractors, their deriders and also those, whom Mr&nbsp;McGrady

                swanning about here as if it were a country club would go down
                the tubes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The people of Northern Ireland, whether they
                liked the agreement or not, certainly liked the idea of the
                absence of violence. They liked the idea of having the
                opportunity for their children to be born and reared in an
                atmosphere different to the one in which they suffered.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept that it is not perfect, but I also
                accept what some Members will probably never accept, that in
                order to manoeuvre a society there has to be a process. That
                provides the opportunity to see the potential for the future and
                to flush out what people perceive are the lies on the other
                side. We built a process that some entered begrudgingly, and
                that others cannot wait to get out of. Against all the odds,
                people built an agreement, but tragically, from day one, some
                have taken an à la carte approach to it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Talk about the &quot;Yes&quot;-campaigners
                sticking together, I remember going to Omagh with the Women’s
                Coalition and finding that the Ulster Unionists had been there
                before us, probably because they did not want to be seen on a
                platform with other &quot;Yes&quot; advocates. That was
                ridiculous; it came close to being sensible when Bono got
                involved. There was no real campaign other than the gutter
                campaign, other than the one in which people had had a long time
                to stand outside Stormont sharpening the knives and waiting for
                those who had created the agreement to come out so they could
                stab them in the back. That is the reality of the situation.

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been suggested that Loyalists should
                decommission. I would love to see the day when that could be
                done, when I could advocate that and stay alive. But the reality
                is that we have been sold out. We are being betrayed by David
                Trimble, we have been betrayed by Tony Blair, we are being
                betrayed by all and sundry. Please go to a working-class
                Loyalist area and tell them that they have been sold out, but
                that they should hand their guns in.</p>

                threat. It may merely mean that I will not be re-elected. Those
                who put themselves in front of the electorate run that risk. The
                phrase was left hanging. Perhaps it is a bit like &quot;Ulster
                will fight and Ulster will be right.&quot; Is it the old
                pathetic nonsense that did not scare anybody then and has no
                chance of scaring me now? I would like clarification because
                Hansard will show that those of us who support the report
                &quot;will pay&quot;. Will pay what? Members spoke about
                punishment beatings. People come here and laugh and guffaw. It
                is all a great wheeze, and then someone mentions punishment
                beatings.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not sure to whom I should address my
                remarks because, as a pragmatist, and having worked with
                pro-agreement and anti-agreement parties for months, I believed
                that we could make the Agreement work. Mr McCrea said that we
                have to take on board and respect the views of minorities, and
                that is so. In any democracy, there will be those who will vote
                for a treaty and those who will vote against it. But for the
                first time since the referendum I have become extremely
                concerned about the direction in which we are going. I know that
                this admission will lend ammunition to those who are
                anti-agreement — although I hope that it will not be
                interpreted in such a way — but we have reached a crisis
                point.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Where are we going if we do not set up an
                Executive on 15&nbsp;February? Have we invested all this time,
                work and commitment, together with receiving the will of the
                people, only to say that we, the politicians, cannot agree and
                are not prepared to govern and lead? That is a dire message to
                be sending at the beginning of a new year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This morning’s debate has told me that we
                are still strangers to one another, and that we do not
                understand one another’s cultures. The Deputy First Minister
                (Designate) drew our attention to recent BBC&nbsp;television
                programmes which I understand reflected the great deal of hurt
                and pain that has been inflicted on one community by the other.
                Other programmes have shown the reciprocal pain and hurt felt by
                the Nationalist community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We did not have a shared agreement on what
                constituted the problem, but we still had to resolve it through
                negotiation. Were agreement to be reached, none of us could
                achieve all that we wanted, and this agreement had to include
                ex-combatants. Others call them terrorists, but the word
                &quot;terror&quot; is ideologically loaded, and that is exactly
                what we are trying to do to each other now — we are trying to
                terrorise people into saying that this will not work. I am not
                prepared to do that. Václav Havel believed that politics was
                the art of the possible. I believe that we can make that
                determination the art of the possible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we voted the First Minister (Designate)
                and Deputy First Minister (Designate) into their positions they
                took a Pledge of Office, but there are others who, when they
                adopt the position of Ministers, will have to say that they
                affirm their commitment to non-violence and exclusively peaceful
                and democratic means and their opposition to any use or threat
                of force by others for any political purpose.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some people may not believe that Ministers
                actually think that when they stand up and say it. I believe it
                because anti-agreement Members will have to swear to work to
                bring the new arrangements into being. If I can believe that
                anti-agreement Members will some day work in good faith to bring
                the new arrangements into being, I have to expect that that will
                be reciprocal, that that good faith will also lead people to
                believe that violence will never again be used as a way of
                resolving our problems. That is the only good faith I can ask of
                people who will take on the serious responsibility of governing
                Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have to stop the creation of a vacuum. We
                have to stop fooling the people by saying that, if we get over
                this hurdle, the crunch will come soon. We have been telling
                people that for a number of months. We have reached the crunch
                time. The vote will have to be taken. Vacuums do not help our
                community. Tensions rise and the most vulnerable in our
                community suffer, particularly those who live at the interfaces.
                However, it is with that spirit of pragmatism that I am going to
                make some suggestions about the report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned about some aspects of the
                report, and my first concern is with the suggestion that there
                be a new economic policy unit —that has all the aspirations of
                kitchen Treasury. It is new; it may work; and I understand the
                political reasoning behind it. However, the European Union, the
                Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom no longer have a
                policy unit which deals only with economic matters and financial
                redistribution. Social development must be an integral part of
                economic policy, and I am concerned that the absence of social
                development in the economic policy unit suggested means that we
                are going back to the old ways of doing things.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, I am concerned that victims are not
                mentioned in the report — the one group of people which has
                been used most for political purposes, batted like a ball from
                one side of the court to the other. There is no mention in the
                report of where the Victims Liaison Unit will be placed. It is
                ironic that, while the unit is presently part of a Minister’s
                portfolio, it will not be the responsibility of any Minister
                given the suggestions that have been made for the new
                Government. If there was ever a group of people who deserved
                facilities and resources that truly address their suffering,
                pain and needs, it is the victims. They deserve to have their
                unit included, and that should be a priority. Should the
                Assembly decide to include junior Ministers, surely
                responsibility for this is a job for such a Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, I am concerned that the work I
                referred to earlier on community tensions has not been specified
                as part of the remit of the Department of Health, Social
                Services and Public Safety. That is the best Department to have
                responsibility for the Victims Liaison Unit. The Voluntary
                Activity Unit, which has done great work in community
                development, should be placed within the Department of Social
                Development. We would have had a Bosnia situation in Northern
                Ireland had that work not been properly resourced, and it is not
                being properly resourced at present.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am confident that the Deputy First Minister
                (Designate) is taking this project forward. I want to have that
                same confidence in the First Minister (Designate). I voted to
                put Mr Trimble in that post, and I believe that he accepted it
                to lead the country. I now expect him to do that.</p>

                Unionist Party Members. In their hands, more than in those of
                any other, rests the future of the pro-Union people and their
                succeeding generations. Their future depends on the vote that
                will be taken at the end of this debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Belfast Agreement, which was crafted and
                controlled by the British Government is, in essence, the terms
                of a conflict resolution between that Government and Sinn
                Fein/IRA. Its real purpose is to further the Government’s
                policy of disengagement from Northern Ireland and to protect the
                lives and property of its first-class British citizens — those
                on the mainland. All other considerations were subservient to
                those objectives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By that agreement, the Ulster Unionist
                leadership — now absent from the Chamber — accepted the
                release of the most infamous and villainous criminals. It agreed
                to the presence of representatives of violent Republicanism in
                government; it conceded the right of the Irish Government to
                have a share in the government of Northern Ireland; it consented
                to the reform of a criminal justice system that was specifically
                designed to combat terrorism; it acquiesced in the proposed
                reform of the RUC to placate those whom that force had lost
                lives to apprehend; and it allowed Sinn Fein/IRA the legal —
                though not the moral or democratic — right to demand the
                fulfilment of every concession under the agreement before any
                decommissioning of their weapons was required.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion asks for Members’ approval of
                what is called a report, but by such approval Ulster Unionist
                Members will be pledging themselves, each and every one of them,
                to make the report’s essential contents their determination on
                15&nbsp;February. I say that because their leader has publicly
                promised that to the Deputy First Minister (Designate).</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What will Ulster Unionist Members achieve by
                approving this report? What will they gain? What will the Union
                gain? What will change in their favour between now and
                15&nbsp;February? The answer is that they will gain absolutely
                nothing but will lose much. Ulster Unionists will have given the
                Secretary of State time to put in place all the necessary
                machinery and arrangements for putting Sinn Fein/IRA in
                government, in the knowledge that on 15&nbsp;February they will
                approve the contents of today’s report. Those arrangements
                will be set in stone the moment Ulster Unionist Members
                determine what the House may approve in this debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 15&nbsp;February, when the Ulster Unionist
                Members make the determination that is now promised by their
                leader, the Secretary of State may set d’Hondt in motion and
                they will be unable to prevent Sinn Fein from taking their
                Ministries. The Ulster Unionist leader may say that the
                Secretary of State can do that anyway. That may be true, but
                imposition is very different from consent. Undemocratic
                imposition may be opposed, but that to which Ulster Unionist
                Members give consent on behalf of the pro-Union people is gone
                for ever.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An approval of this report, endorsed by a
                majority of Unionists, will give the green light to the
                Secretary of State to proceed in the knowledge that on
                15&nbsp;February the Ulster Unionist Members will consent to the
                determination.</p>

                a determination, though it may not formally come into effect
                until 15&nbsp;February. The future of the Union will be placed
                in the hands of a Secretary of State who openly supports Irish
                unity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After 15&nbsp;February, what can Members do
                when d’Hondt comes into operation and puts Sinn Fein/IRA in
                government? Members may refuse to participate in the Executive
                and may even cause the Assembly, at some future date, to
                dissolve. But consider what Members will already have done by
                then. By that time, whether Members &quot;play&quot; in the
                Executive or cause the Assembly to collapse, they will have
                already agreed that some institutions will remain in place.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">According to the Secretary of State’s
                devolution document, the North/South Ministerial Council and the
                cross-border implementation bodies will be enshrined in
                legislation and in international treaties between the Government
                of the Republic of Ireland and the British Government. With
                those bodies permanently established, will Sinn Fein or the SDLP
                shed any tears if the Assembly, which is designed to offer
                consolation to Unionists, then collapses? Refusal to take part
                at that time will be worth little, and it will expose Members to
                the blame of bringing the Assembly down.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ulster Unionist leadership may still be
                prepared to trust Mr&nbsp;Blair’s pledges. Members may believe
                that Mr&nbsp;Blair will not operate d’Hondt or that he will
                not permit the Secretary of State to do so until the IRA agrees
                to decommission. If that is where Members place their trust,
                they should not hold their breath. Members should judge the
                worth of such promises on the basis of the fulfilment of pledges
                that have already been given. Before the referendum,
                Mr&nbsp;Blair promised that no prisoners would be released until
                decommissioning had begun. What price is a pledge? Cardinal
                Wolsey, at a time when princes and kings were the Government,
                quoted the Bible:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Put not your trust in princes&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today that advice is even more applicable to
                Prime Ministers. If Sinn&nbsp;Fein is placed in government
                without decommissioning, there will be absolutely no reason for
                it ever to decommission.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is only one way in which all the
                pro-Union people and their Assembly representatives can fulfil
                our obligations and that is to refuse, now — at this time —
                before it is too late. Members must refuse to further this
                process in any way until actual and substantial decommissioning
                has begun and the deadline has been fixed for its completion. It
                must be real decommissioning — not some token or fig leaf that
                would allow unreasonable and unjust pressure to be put upon
                Members as democrats. It must ensure that a total ceasefire is
                maintained and must not be one that allows the continuing murder
                and mutilation of our fellow citizens on both sides of the
                community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For me, the preservation of the Union and my
                right to full and equal British citizenship, and the extension
                of such rights and the associated benefits to every citizen,
                take precedence over all else. It is above personal and party
                interest. I believe that that view is shared by many in the
                Ulster Unionist Party.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like the pro-Union people to be able
                to commend the members of the Ulster Unionist Party for their
                courage and self-sacrifice, rather than condemn them for their
                weakness and self-interest.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The verdict of history and of the pro-Union
                people – and some Members may smile, but it is no smiling
                matter – and of successive generations will depend upon how
                Unionist Members vote in this debate. I ask, therefore, in the
                name of the Union, and in the name of conscience, that those
                Members put self-interest and party aside, put the Union
                foremost and reject this report.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Watson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Republican movement claims that there is
                no requirement for decommissioning even within the two-year time
                span. That is unacceptable given the terms of the agreement. It
                is also intolerable to Unionists and to the British and Irish
                Governments — or so they claim. There can be no progress
                towards an Executive role for Sinn Fein while it maintains its
                &quot;no, nothing, never&quot; policy. The ceasefires are not
                nearly as comprehensive as they should be. Loyalists and
                Republicans indulge nightly in Fascist thuggery against their
                communities, and even more so since the agreement. Other
                indications are not encouraging for the immediate future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members must not be blind to the reality
                about the Provisional IRA. This organisation is in many respects
                better equipped than the Irish Defence Forces — it still has
                the capacity to perpetrate a thousand Omaghs and flatten every
                town on this island. Members are still entitled to ask &quot;Is
                the war over?&quot; These are noble words and were spoken in
                earnest by the First Minister (Designate) in November 1998.
                However, I must differ with him on several points.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Neither the Irish nor the British Government
                would currently find it unacceptable to have Sinn Fein/IRA in
                government without decommissioning. The total surrender to, and
                daily appeasement of, the Sinn Fein/IRA terrorists means that
                this whole process must result in armed terrorists being in the
                Executive. If that does not happen, the Governments fear that
                they will return to doing what they do best — killing and
                bombing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Currently, the difference between the
                so-called peace and the ongoing conflict can be measured in
                centimetres. The &quot;peace&quot; involves almost unthinkable
                mutilations of human limbs. The distance in centimetres from the
                limbs to the abdomen, where the same wounds would prove fatal,
                is the distance between life and death, the human measure
                between ceasefire and war. Already this year 16 people have been
                seriously wounded — the warning signs are there for all to
                see. It is correct to say that there is no linkage between
                decommissioning and seats in the Executive. That is because of
                the poor negotiating skills of the Unionist team, whose
                performance and attendance enabled Sinn Fein/IRA to gain
                credibility on the world stage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To negotiate on any occasion with armed
                terrorists is to be involved in a blackmail process, and this is
                exactly what happened. There is much talk about mandates, but
                truth, principle and morality come before any mandate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Adolf Hitler, after many years of
                intimidating his political and religious opponents, received a
                mandate. The result was the Second World War. Col Gaddafi has an
                overwhelming mandate from his people, yet atrocities like
                Lockerbie take place, and he arms terrorists across the world.
                Even Saddam Hussein has a mandate, but his treatment of the
                Kurdish people in northern Iraq and the genocide of the Marsh
                Arabs in southern Iran has to be condemned as inhuman.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mandate or not, no right-thinking person
                could in any circumstances permit a group such as
                Sinn&nbsp;Fein/IRA into government while murder and mutilation
                continue daily.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These are the people responsible for some of
                the worst human rights atrocities of the twentieth century. One
                thinks of Patsy Gillespie, a human bomb tied into a lorry and
                sent to his death at a checkpoint in Londonderry. One thinks of
                the sectarian slaughter of 10 Protestant workmen at Kingsmills,
                of the Orangemen in Tullyvallen, of Enniskillen and Teebane —
                one could go on and on. This country is now on the verge of
                seeing these very people — Sinn Fein/IRA — in the Government
                of Northern Ireland. Members are on the brink of setting up
                cross-border bodies with executive powers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This proposal by the First Minister
                (Designate) and his friends, seeking the approval of the
                Assembly, and specifically of the Members from his own party,
                must be considered very carefully. I think back to December 1995
                when Mr Trimble, replying to an invitation to talks from Mr
                Spring, said</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We are not prepared to negotiate the
                internal affairs of Northern Ireland with a foreign
                Government.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How times have changed. We think back to
                Mr&nbsp;Trimble chiding Mr&nbsp;Mayhew in October&nbsp;1995 on
                the subject of decommissioning:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;I must warn Sir Patrick to stick to his
                guns and his promise on this issue. We are not going to be party
                to a fudge&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the situation were not so critical it
                would be farcical. The inability of Mr Trimble, the First
                Minister (Designate), and his negotiators to put down a marker
                once and for all on decommissioning has to be recognised.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This lack of commitment to draw a line in the
                sand and say &quot;Enough is enough&quot; is the problem today.
                The pollution of democracy with the presence of armed terrorists
                on the verge of entering government is simply because Mr Trimble
                has failed from 1995 to 1999 to exclude armed Sinn Fein/IRA from
                his table.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Indeed, it was highly significant that on the
                day when the Ulster Unionist Party held a disciplinary meeting
                in respect of three other members and myself, Mr Trimble met Mr
                Adams in private, the first of five meetings to date, thus
                paving the way for Sinn Fein’s entry into government. This is
                evident to all of us in the Unionist family who see this
                blackmail process for what it is.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Trimble’s repeated assertion that there
                is life after politics indicates that his long-term intention is
                to cut a deal allowing Sinn Fein/IRA into government and move
                on, leaving his fellow Unionists to carry the can.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the vote to approve this report is of no
                real significance, then it is much better to be safe than sorry.
                To reject this report in itself lets the Governments and Sinn
                Fein/IRA see that, finally, a marker has been laid down. Without
                the actual handing over of weapons, terrorists are unacceptable
                in governments and their nightly mutilations are unacceptable in
                any civilised society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem with this whole process is that,
                sooner rather than later, we are going to face the crisis. This
                process is laid on a foundation of murder, bombings and terror.
                In reality it is built on sand, with dire consequences for us
                all in the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Until the shadow of the gun is removed from
                all aspects of society and true, lasting peace realised, we are
                beholden to the gunman. This is the dilemma that we all face.
                There have been many changes in Northern Ireland in recent
                years, some for good, but sadly some for bad, and attitudes
                never change.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In October 1997 Mr Trimble told his party
                faithful</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the key reason for staying in these
                talks is that nothing can come out of them without our consent.
                This veto means that everything must pass through the Ulster
                Unionist Party talks team before it goes to the people.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One must now reflect on the words and see
                directly where the blame for the following achievements lies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, the prisoner releases scheme is an
                issue that has caused much pain and agony for many people, in
                particular the families of those who have lost loved ones during
                the past 30 years of terror. Watching the gloating triumphalism
                of many of the Republican prisoners has reopened the wounds of
                many pained people all over this Province.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The virtual amnesty for all the perpetrators
                of murder beggars belief. As a result of this agreement, victims’
                families, who have waited and listened, some for over
                20&nbsp;years, to promise after promise that no stone would be
                left unturned to find their killers and that there would be no
                hiding place for the murderers, are now trying to come to terms
                with the fact that these promises were nothing more than empty
                gestures. Their faith in British justice is lost for ever.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The destruction and demoralisation of the RUC
                is another dividend of the agreement. No doubt the root-
                and-branch change here will greatly help the terrorists in a
                renewed campaign — another victory for the Unionist
                negotiators.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The impending dismissal of prison officers
                and the pushing through of a controversial redundancy package is
                again linked to the agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Stand-alone cross-border bodies with
                executive powers — of all the items in the agreement, this
                particular issue lays bare all the false claims that the current
                Unionist Party leadership would not negotiate on our
                sovereignty. This is exactly what they have done with the
                removal of the Government of Ireland Act.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today, though, is not a day for
                recriminations; it is a day for every Ulsterman to take stock of
                what is being asked of him. We believe that approval of this
                report today will leave the door open for the Secretary of State
                to kick-start the shadow Executive and then the full Executive
                at her own discretion. In my constituency, Upper Bann, there has
                never been any semblance of normality or ceasefire. The bombing
                of Portadown, Banbridge and nearby Moira has blasted people’s
                hopes yet again. The lingering sore of 16 unresolved IRA murders
                since 1984 continues to fester and cause bitter resentment.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The orchestration of a form of religious
                intolerance which cannot permit a church parade to continue
                along an arterial route back into Portadown, in order to
                blackmail the Government into spending millions to solve the
                problem, has poisoned community relations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even the decision to switch the
                Portadown-Cliftonville football match to Belfast and the banning
                of Portadown supporters from attending it stinks to high heaven.
                One wonders how many GAA fixtures have been changed, or fans
                barred, due to RUC advice. This is the real situation in
                Northern Ireland in 1999.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And so, we come to approve this report. It is
                too late to lock the stable door once the horse has bolted. It
                is too late for Mr&nbsp;Taylor and Mr&nbsp;Maginnis to complain
                about prisoner releases, after approving and supporting them.
                The honourable thing for them to do would be to admit that they
                helped to secure these releases, that they made a mistake and
                have got nothing in return.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have listened to Mr&nbsp;Watson and to
                others. We know roughly where we are, and the report tells us
                where we are going, but let us remind ourselves where we have
                come from.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The vexed constitutional question is
                &quot;Who owns Northern Ireland?&quot; Does it belong to Britain
                or does it belong to a united Ireland? The agreement solves this
                problem because it says that it is the people of Northern
                Ireland who own it. It is only they who can determine its
                constitutional future and that is the building block from which
                we are all starting. It is the people who will determine their
                own future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland is a part of the United
                Kingdom because the people of Northern Ireland so determine. If
                Northern Ireland were to join a united Ireland, it would be only
                the people of Northern Ireland who could determine that. As
                Nationalists might say &quot;If you want to unite Ireland, first
                unite the people&quot;, whereas a Unionist might say &quot;If
                you want to secure the Union, unite the people of Northern
                Ireland&quot;. In this regard, the self-interests of Unionism
                and Nationalism coincide.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have had 30 years of conflict, and
                Mr&nbsp;Watson has referred to a number of atrocities. We all
                know about them, but we cannot go back and change them. However,
                we can try to change the future so that we do not have to go
                through another 30&nbsp;years of conflict. That is what the
                agreement is about and this is the working out of that
                agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Together, the Ulster Unionist Party and the
                SDLP have driven the process forward and have taken us towards
                &quot;Devolution Day&quot; on 10&nbsp;March. This will be
                determined by a legislative device — a meeting of the Privy
                Council. We will reach that date, and at that point the UUP will
                have fulfilled all of its obligations under the agreement, as
                will the SDLP. There are, of course, other obligations which
                need to be fulfilled and we can talk about them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important for Unionism to reflect that,
                under this agreement, self-determination for
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland, and as a consequence of that the repeal
                of articles 2 and 3, will be a big issue for the Dublin
                Government and the citizens of the Irish Republic. Not only will
                they have repealed articles 2&nbsp;and 3, but any future
                creation of a united Ireland will require a referendum in the
                Irish Republic. Anybody who knows anything about the Irish
                Republic will know that the armed struggle over the years has
                been massively counter-productive to the point that today
                citizens of the Irish Republic would not take Northern Ireland
                as a gift.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unionism and the Union are secure because
                their future will rest with the people of Northern Ireland, and
                we are their representatives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We can then move on from that point to ask
                how will we share Northern Ireland — how will we get on? The
                agreement looks towards there being a partnership of Unionist,
                Nationalist, Loyalist and Republican, working together for the
                greatest good of all, and that is the aim of this report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend the SDLP, which has worked with us,
                has fought its corner, and has argued its point of view, but it
                has always been for the greater good of the people of Northern
                Ireland. That is our aim also, and that is why this report is
                important, and it is why we need to take it forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unionism and Nationalism have both made
                gains. Do we want a united Ireland? Only the people of Northern
                Ireland can deliver that. In so far as this generation is
                concerned, and in so far as anyone can see into the future, I do
                not see that happening. I do not foresee the people of Northern
                Ireland making that decision — but ultimately that is a matter
                for them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will go through this process today, meet
                again on 15 February to discuss it further and then march
                forward together to 10 March. That is the point at which
                devolution can happen, the point when Northern&nbsp;Ireland’s
                political representatives begin to govern its people in a
                partnership, inclusive of everyone, as long as everyone meets
                his obligations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Republican movement has made gains, and a
                number of those have been referred to: power-sharing; full
                partnership; the equality agenda; the criminal justice review;
                the Patten Commission; prisoner releases; North/South
                implementation bodies; North/South areas of co-operation; and a
                North/South Ministerial Council.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Provisional movement has a clear
                obligation under the agreement. As David&nbsp;Trimble outlined
                earlier, there are a number of references to that in the
                agreement. All of this was thought about, though I can
                understand the confusion among those who were not part of the
                talks. The Declaration of Support, the Pledge of Office, clause
                25 of strand one, the transitional arrangements and the chapter
                on decommissioning all make this point clear. This is a
                reasonable demand. With all the weaponry out there — and
                bearing in mind that when Sinn Fein signed up to the agreement
                it signed up to total decommissioning by May 2000, and we are
                well into that period — we as Unionists need to know the start
                date, and we need to see the process start.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If that process does not begin, then,
                unfortunately, there will be consequences. I will not go into
                the detail of what they might be, but it would then be
                impossible for us to move forward. That might be Sinn Fein’s
                objective, but that would be inconsistent with what that party
                has signed up to in the agreement, which is an acceptance that
                the people of the island of Ireland are not a nation in a
                political sense and that, therefore, they have no right to
                territorial unity and to national self-government. I understand
                that that has been difficult for Sinn Fein. After 10 March, with
                this final step taken, we can move forward with Sinn Fein. If
                that step is not taken, there are other avenues of approach.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is absolutely immoral to hold on to vast
                quantities of Semtex. We also know that if the guns are out
                there, they are used. It was the Provisionals’ Semtex that was
                used in Omagh. The Provisionals bought the detonators used in
                Omagh in Arizona in 1989. If Semtex is out there, it will fall
                into refusenik hands, and the same will happen with the guns.
                They must be destroyed. That is what the people voted for.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Denis&nbsp;Watson talked about people having
                mandates. Gaddafi has a mandate and Hitler had one too. This
                agreement has the overwhelming mandate of the people of Northern
                Ireland, with almost 72% voting for it in a very high poll.</p>

                forward on this. In terms of a Nationalist or Republican agenda,
                the people of the island of Ireland voted overwhelmingly in
                favour of the agreement. We want to implement this in
                partnership because that offers the best way forward, and that
                can happen if everyone meets his obligations. We and the SDLP
                have met ours. The Provisional movement must now meet its
                obligations. We know the end date for decommissioning, but we
                must know the start date and we must see it started.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Presiding Officer, I welcome and support
                the approval of the report of the First Minister (Designate) and
                Deputy First Minister (Designate), a report presented, we might
                note with some interest, on the day which celebrates the memory
                of the great human rights leader Martin Luther King, a man whose
                work has been an inspiration to my party and human rights
                campaigners everywhere.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the report. At last we can see with
                greater clarity the form and the functions of the political
                institutions which the majority here have been mandated to
                establish by the endorsement which the Good Friday Agreement
                received in the joint referenda last May. We are now on a fixed
                and certain timetable towards the creation of those institutions
                with 15&nbsp;February and 10&nbsp;March as the next key dates.
                In reaching this point, the report indicates the extensive
                consultations which were held involving all the pro-agreement
                parties. There were also many informal contacts. I do not
                believe, therefore, that any party can, with credibility, claim
                that its views were not noted and taken account of, as has been
                suggested in this debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In expressing its general welcome for the
                arrangements proposed by the 18&nbsp;December agreement, the
                SDLP is pleased by a number of features. The range of
                responsibilities associated with departmental structures will
                give greater coherence to the administration. It will require
                intensive cross-party co-operation for its effective operation
                and provide opportunities for a new dynamic in the development
                and implementation of policies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two features of the 18&nbsp;December
                agreement deserve particular comment. First, equality will be a
                central responsibility. Equality has been an issue of major
                importance to the SDLP since it was founded out of the civil
                rights movement. From the outset of the pre-18&nbsp;December
                negotiations we stood by the proposition for such a provision.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Monitoring, evaluating and determining
                measures across the administration, in conjunction with the
                Ministers responsible for the various Departments, will ensure
                that equality principles are observed and effected throughout
                all areas of government. Indeed, we believe that the Assembly
                should assist in this task by the establishment of a special
                committee to scrutinise equality.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Placing this responsibility at the heart of
                government symbolises, in a powerfully effective way, a joint
                commitment by the leading Ministers of both communities to have
                such principles upheld throughout the administration. This puts
                an onus on both that, as they co-ordinate a whole programme of
                government, they also guarantee that it be fully informed by
                equality principles.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No other approach would be likely to have the
                same overall effect. A free-standing Department controlled by a
                representative of a party from only one side of the community
                could never be as powerfully symbolic of a new commitment to
                equality and justice for all, nor could it have the same
                potential for ensuring that this commitment is reflected across
                all Departments. This is as it should be, given the overriding
                importance of ensuring that the new Administration and the
                North/South Ministerial Council is guided by principles of human
                and civil rights.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The announcement today of the appointment of
                Professor&nbsp;Brice&nbsp;Dickson to head the new Human Rights
                Commission marks further progress in a vital confidence-building
                area. We wish him and his future colleagues well as they take up
                their responsibilities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With respect to the North/South arrangements,
                I am particularly pleased to note the strong
                economic-development dimension to several of the implementation
                bodies and areas for co-operation. I have long been of the view
                that a more co-ordinated North/South approach to planning
                economic development would be to the mutual benefit of people in
                both parts of Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This will be achieved most notably by
                implementation bodies such as those for trade and business
                development, special European Union programmes and aquaculture
                and marine matters. Economic initiatives on the part of existing
                bodies such as those for tourism, agriculture and transport will
                be of mutual benefit to both parts of Ireland — the trade and
                business development implementation body will be of particular
                significance in promoting trade between both parts of Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Public procurement programmes implemented on
                an all-island basis will significantly increase opportunities
                for northern enterprises to win a greater share of public-sector
                business in the South. Similarly, international trade fairs and
                missions will combine the strengths of businesses in both parts
                of the island. Research and development projects will mobilise
                the talents of universities and research institutes on an
                all-island basis to address problems of common concern.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All of this should significantly contribute
                to the process of attracting more inward investment to both
                parts of the island — particularly to the North.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I wish to return to the political
                process. Since Good Friday, the whole process has been a test of
                our respective capacities to meet the requirements of that
                historic agreement. The difficulties that have arisen are not
                uncommon in other contexts where conflicting parties have agreed
                to engage in a joint healing process. We have encountered delays
                and difficulties which have, not surprisingly, been attributed
                to the alleged bad faith of one party or the other, either to
                their reluctance to work the new arrangements, or to a real
                desire to frustrate the implementation of these arrangements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our historically deep-rooted suspicions, our
                pain and our suffering continue to feed our perceptions and
                judgements of each other and, in doing so, hold a danger of
                causing further delay. Alongside these impulses, which, at their
                worst, could lead us back to the brink of self-destruction, we
                have felt other impulses encouraging us to continue, to persist
                in order to meet the obligations we placed upon ourselves last
                Good Friday — obligations to create conditions for a better
                society where trust and mutual confidence will gradually
                dissipate those age-old suspicions, fears and apprehensions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Realistically, this can only happen when we
                start working together for the common good in the practical
                matters of government. It was such impulses that brought us
                through the difficulties of the weeks before Christmas to reach
                another agreement. The report is a further testament to those
                impulses.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In striking an optimistic note, I am not
                unaware of the roadblocks that lie ahead. But, just as we have
                found ways of dealing with the difficulties since Good Friday,
                we must not allow our imaginations to fail us in dealing with
                what remains, either in terms of institution building or
                confidence building, as is the case with the problem posed by
                the commitment to promote decommissioning.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Campbell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to address the matters outlined in Mr
                Farren’s closing remarks. In this 26-page report, there is no
                mention whatsoever of the dreaded D-word. The word that has
                haunted proceedings of this Assembly since its establishment,
                the word that has hung over all of our deliberations like a
                spectre. The First Minister (Designate) has told us that
                decommissioning has to begin — must begin — before an
                Executive can be established.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to decommissioning, I have no
                doubt that, in the next month or two, there will be some kind of
                event which will be dressed up to look like a beginning to
                decommissioning. This will have to happen, according to the
                contents of the personal message from the First Minister
                (Designate), dated 8&nbsp;January — of course, that is no

                referred to above if Sinn Fein/IRA do not honour their
                commitment to decommissioning made under the Belfast
                Agreement&quot;</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;If they do not, the Ulster Unionist
                Party will not form an Executive that includes Sinn Fein.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Strong words. That is why some event will
                take place which will allow the First Minister (Designate) to
                say that decommissioning has begun, thus triggering the d’Hondt
                system, which will allow for representatives of Sinn Fein/IRA to
                be included in the Executive. The question of ongoing,
                meaningful and verifiable decommissioning must be addressed, but
                this document fails to do so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The arguments about whether decommissioning
                should take place before or after the formation of an Executive
                have been well rehearsed. Everyone, except for some elements in
                the Ulster Unionist Party, now accepts that this is not in the
                agreement. Every other party in Northern Ireland, be it
                pro-agreement or anti-agreement, accepts that. Everyone in the
                Republic of Ireland accepts that. Everyone in Great Britain
                accepts that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But there are elements in the Ulster Unionist
                Party who do not. I can understand why — pride. There is no
                mention of decommissioning prior to the formation of the
                Executive, and we are going to get some kind of fudge, first, to
                allow the First Minister (Designate) off the hook so that he can
                try to salvage some semblance of dignity and say that a form of
                decommissioning has started, and, secondly, to allow two Sinn
                Fein/IRA Members to take their places in the Executive. Of
                course, this should have been in the agreement — it was not.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been much deliberation about the
                need for Nationalist support for what is to be put in place,
                whether that be with regard to the future of policing in
                Northern Ireland, or in terms of the general political
                situation. Indeed, we hear a great deal about the equality
                agenda, not least from Mr&nbsp;Farren and others. This is
                presented as almost a prerequisite for Nationalist
                participation. But, the one thing which has not been
                acknowledged by the pro-agreement parties, either in the media
                or in the Assembly, is the fact that over half of the Unionist
                population has the gravest possible reservations about what is
                going on.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been no acceptance of that fact. We
                have been discounted. Mr&nbsp;Mallon said that we have a point
                of view. Well, thanks very much. Either he is being patronising,
                or he is admitting that not only do we have a point of view but
                we represent the majority of the Unionist community.</p>

                and debate if we had a series of fundamental developments in
                Northern Ireland about which over half of the Nationalist
                community had grave reservations? Would the media say that they
                were of no consequence? Would the Nationalists allow themselves
                to be patronised and told &quot;We will listen to what you say,
                but we will carry on regardless&quot;? The &quot;Yes&quot; camp
                admits that well over half of our community — and the figure
                is growing by the day — has the gravest possible reservations
                about what is going on. So how is that going to be addressed?
                What value is going to be put on that legitimate complaint?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is nonsense to talk of Unionist
                sensitivities and Nationalist rights. I am sick, sore and tired
                of hearing that Nationalist grievances have to be addressed
                while we ensure that the Unionists do not get annoyed and go
                ballistic. The people whom I represent are angry because their
                rights have been trampled on. They do not get jobs allocated on
                the basis of merit. They have been subjected to a terror
                campaign for over thirty years, and what do they get? They get
                an agreement rammed down their throats whether they like it or
                not, and all the Deputy First Minister (Designate) can say is
                that they have a point of view.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us look at the issue of language. On
                page&nbsp;25 of the report is an example of what I have been
                talking about. This document shows that the Irish language is
                all-important, as if we needed telling. According to the space
                given to the languages in this report, Irish is seven times more
                important than Ulster-Scots. We represent the majority in
                Northern Ireland. A tiny minority use the Irish language, some
                genuinely and many for political purposes. They get seven times
                as much coverage as Ulster-Scots. Is it any wonder our people
                are angry?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The anger is building in our community about
                an agreement which is going to be forced down our throats
                whether we like it or not, and the Assembly needs to be very
                careful and take account of the views of all our people, many of
                whom do not see the Assembly as representing their interests.
                They think we are avoiding the issue of decommissioning and
                trying to get two gunmen, representatives of terror and
                destruction, into the heart of the Government of this country
                that we love so well.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat a Chathaoirligh. As
                Mr&nbsp;Adams has said, Sinn Fein will be giving its political
                support to the December&nbsp;18 agreement in spite of our
                reservations about some aspects of it. Our reservations are
                sincerely held. Other parties have also made their positions
                clear in regard to the conduct of the negotiations. Sinn Fein’s
                view is that this was, in Nationalist terms, a solo run by the
                SDLP.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The agreement falls short of what was
                possible and of what Nationalists expected. In particular, we
                believe the opposition of the SDLP to a stand-alone equality
                department was a fundamental blunder.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The deal on this issue leaves equality
                located somewhere between the First Minister (Designate) and the
                Deputy First Minister (Designate). It would surely be better to
                have a dedicated Department with a cross-party scrutiny
                committee to deal with the issue when it becomes a continuing
                bone of contention, or, alternatively, is ignored or
                long-fingered to avoid dissension between the First Minister
                (Designate) and the Deputy First Minister (Designate).</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under the deal, there is a real possibility
                that equality will be treated with less urgency than other
                issues. In that event, we will all come under justifiably severe
                criticism from the people, who will feel short-changed yet
                again. The First Minister (Designate) and the Deputy First
                Minister (Designate) will, of course, have a crucial arbiter’s
                role in any dispute between Departments, but on this question
                they cannot be independent arbiters in their own Department.
                Their failure to agree a motion to issue a determination on
                their own report adequately demonstrates this point.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On their track records, unless they are
                subjected to public scrutiny, neither the Unionist parties nor
                the British Government can be fully trusted to deliver on the
                equality agenda. The proposals that are before the House do not
                contain details of any satisfactory scrutiny mechanism. I
                welcome the comment by Sean&nbsp;Farren that there will be a
                scrutiny committee on equality. I would welcome an indication by
                the next speaker on behalf of the Unionist Party that it has
                also agreed to accept that. It would certainly be reassuring to
                know that we all have a role in satisfying expectations on the
                equality agenda.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">David Trimble and Denis&nbsp;Watson spoke
                about intimidation and punishment beatings and gave examples.
                One of the most perplexing issues arising from the equality
                agenda is that, on the Garvaghy&nbsp;Road, which is in the
                constituency of both David&nbsp;Trimble and Denis&nbsp;Watson,
                there are nightly punishment beatings and intimidation. Those
                who are inextricably linked to the Orange Order and those who
                are organising the Garvaghy&nbsp;Road protest, which has been
                going on for more than 200&nbsp;days and which has a history of
                some years, should use their influence to bring the protest to
                an end.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">David Trimble’s attitude to the rights of
                those who voted for Sinn Fein and his attitude to the provisions
                of the agreement do not give much cause for optimism that
                equality will be promoted with vigour. Discriminatory practices
                have distorted the political landscape in the North, and have
                destroyed the lives of many generations. The Assembly should
                make it clear that that will no longer be tolerated. We should
                go further and ensure that there is no role for those who would
                return to the bad old practice of Unionist domination and the
                denial of rights.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Good Friday Agreement sets out new and
                radical guidelines for public bodies for a range of
                under-represented sections of society. The relationship of those
                bodies to the public will be very different to that which such
                bodies had in the past. New Departments with new Ministers will
                need a great deal of help, advice and encouragement in that
                respect if we are to set out proper work practices from the
                outset.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Equality and the eradication of
                discrimination are central to the building of a stable and
                cohesive society. There can be no lasting political settlement
                that is not built on a solid foundation of equality, a
                fundamental, democratic right which must be delivered. The most
                effective manner of ensuring that would have been through the
                creation of a stand-alone, dedicated Department of Equality,
                subject to examination by a cross-party committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Good Friday Agreement was heralded as the
                beginning of the end of our shared history of misery, conflict,
                violence and grief. Throughout the island, the people, by an
                overwhelming majority, have welcomed and supported the political
                accommodations — yes, and the compromises — that were so
                painstakingly negotiated over so many months. The key concept is
                equality. The brave new beginning that the people of Ireland
                voted for, the democratic society that we are attempting to
                create, can only be built on the most solid foundations of
                equality.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members have referred to the remarks
                made by Mr&nbsp;Taylor last night. We have been entertained in
                the past by Mr&nbsp;Percentage. Mr&nbsp;Taylor is a fascinating
                politician, as he changes his position depending on the
                political wind. He has been framing percentages for a
                considerable time, just like his leader and previous leaders.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But Mr&nbsp;Taylor, in some of his remarks
                — though not all of them — over past months, and Sir&nbsp;Reg&nbsp;Empey
                and Mr&nbsp;McGimpsey today have suggested that when they say
                that people must change they are referring to all and not just
                to their political opponents. They are talking about those in
                their political constituencies, and I want to acknowledge that
                we have heard those comments and pay attention to them. Our task
                is to ensure that they reject the propositions of those who
                would tear up the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir&nbsp;Reg&nbsp;Empey in his argument about
                change made points with which I agree. Those who are
                pro-agreement must show leadership. Eighty-five percent of the
                electorate in this country voted in the referendum to support
                the Good Friday Agreement, and Sinn Fein will be playing its
                part in the coalition Government that will be established as a
                result. I welcome the fact that 80% of the Executive Cabinet
                will be from parties who are pro-agreement. I like those odds,
                and our people like them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Catholics, Protestants, the centre,

                exclusion.&quot; They want an inclusive, power-sharing agreement
                to build a new future for our people and they are sending a
                message to those in the &quot;no&quot; camp that their day has
                gone. There is a new reality and political dispensation which we

                Ulster Unionist Party that, while the Assembly could be brought
                down, the North/South Ministerial Council would be enshrined in
                law. The threat there, according to Mr&nbsp;McCartney, is that
                it would continue even if the Executive fell by the wayside.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The North/South Ministerial Council will
                comprise Ministers or junior Ministers. They will only be able
                to take decisions based on the Assembly and the Executive. If
                there is no Executive and no Assembly, there will not be any
                Ministers to take such decisions or to be accountable. There is
                to be an inextricable linkage between the North/South
                Ministerial Council and the Assembly. Mr&nbsp;McCartney’s
                logic has to be seen to be believed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Knowing the forensic mind of
                Mr&nbsp;McCartney, I am sure he will examine every word I have
                said today. When Mr&nbsp;McCartney is not in the Chamber,
                neither is his party, for they are one and the same. He said
                earlier that decommissioning must take place. I put it to him
                again for the fourth time, and I am still awaiting his reply,
                that he alone among the Unionist family has made it very clear
                that he will accept those with paramilitary links into
                Government without decommissioning. I refer to paragraph 4 of
                his article which appeared in the Belfast Telegraph on
                1&nbsp;May&nbsp;1998, and I ask Mr&nbsp;McCartney to deny the
                validity of what I say: he alone as a Unionist Leader would
                accept Sinn Fein in Government without decommissioning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Farren and Sinn Fein have referred to the
                issues of rights and equality. Mr&nbsp;Adams referred to equal
                numbers of Unionists and Nationalists in the Executive. Equality
                does not necessarily mean equity and fairness. Sinn Fein says
                that it has a right to be in the Executive because of its
                mandate from the people. No right is absolute; no right is
                unconditional. The most sacred right of all, the right to life,
                is not unconditional. It is accepted under international law
                that the due process of law can carry forward and execute, or
                take life, in defence of civic society. No right is absolute.
                Every right is conditional.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ulster Unionist Party is not opposed to
                the presence of Sinn Fein in Government provided that it
                subscribes to the conditions which give it the right to
                participate in Government.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When he was interviewed on the radio this
                morning Sean Farren referred to Prof&nbsp;Brice&nbsp;Dickson,
                and Barry&nbsp;Cowan asked Mr&nbsp;Farren if there was
                inequality in Northern Ireland and if there was a need for a
                rights commission. Mr&nbsp;Farren said that we, like any other
                community, should abide by international standards or rights.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I listen to the Sinn Fein perspective and try
                to understand when they say that in Northern Ireland there is a
                group — smaller than the Unionist group — that wishes to
                preserve its culture, its language, its education and all of
                those aspects that define it as a group. The Council of Europe
                defines such a group as those who wish to preserve that which
                gives them cohesiveness.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council of Europe has produced the most
                effective and, indeed, the only legally binding rights agreement
                in international law. Based on that agreement, I ask Sinn Fein
                what are they being denied? The Council of Europe talks about
                effective equality — social, political, cultural and economic
                — and I contend that this is not denied in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Article 11 of the Council of Europe’s
                charter allows one to use one’s own name in one’s own
                language, to display signs in one’s own language, to be
                educated in one’s culture and history — and adequate
                opportunities for teacher training in that culture should be
                provided —to allow one to set up and manage private
                educational and training institutions, to learn one’s own
                language and create conditions for effective participation in
                cultural, social, economic and public life.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ulster Unionists want such conditions and we
                believe that we have such conditions. Indeed, we believe there
                is a case for a scrutiny committee to deal with this aspect of
                rights and equality. That will need to be looked at very
                carefully by Members over the next month. As my Colleagues have
                said, the opportunity is there to be taken by all those who wish
                to do so. But those who wish to participate in government must
                be committed to peace.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion and its commitment to
                10&nbsp;March as the date for devolution.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a comprehensive report and an
                important step in the implementation of the will of the people
                as demonstrated by their support for the agreement. Reference to
                equality has been made, and Members are aware how weighty,
                potent and powerful an issue that is — one of fundamental
                importance to the development of trust and confidence in the
                community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue of equality can best be dealt with
                through the offices of the First Minister (Designate) and the
                Deputy First Minister (Designate). This does not represent any
                diminution in transparency, openness or effectiveness. It is
                sensible and logical to have the issue of equality dealt with
                centrally.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any of the 10&nbsp;members of the Executive
                can bring equality issues from their own Departments, or from
                any other Departments, to meetings of the Executive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This report allows for a comprehensive
                equality agenda. Concerns with equality issues can be raised
                with departmental Committees and, subsequently, with the
                Assembly as well. I remind those who have criticisms about the
                arrangements in the report to keep in mind the role and scope of
                the Equality Commission under the Act. Members should be aware
                of its capacity to act and oversee the work across all
                Departments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Concerns have been expressed about a central
                economic policy unit. Paragraph 3.7 states that both Ministers
                will have to tackle the social, economic and cultural neglect in
                this community. This together with the accompanying commitment
                to tackle the inequalities and inconsistencies that exist in
                education, health, economic development and in other key areas
                will be well received by everyone.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The date set for the Assembly to begin work
                on the allocation of ministerial offices, on the setting up of
                North/South bodies and the British-Irish Council and on detailed
                arrangements for the Civic Forum is 15&nbsp;February. All these
                are important elements of the agreement which we who stand by
                the agreement are commissioned to deliver. The agreement was
                endorsed by a clear majority of the electorate, and we must
                remind ourselves of that, regardless of some Members’
                interpretations. Members who support the agreement are
                commissioned to put this in place, and those who hold back now
                will be acting against the clearly expressed wishes of the
                people and will be seen as trying to subvert the will of the
                people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the report is passed, and if on
                15&nbsp;February a determination on the structures for building
                an inclusive society is reached, the Assembly will have
                fulfilled its obligations. The public will have little time or
                tolerance for those who insist on delaying or blocking progress
                thereafter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the one hand, there can be no sustainable
                argument against delaying the start of decommissioning by
                paramilitaries on both sides, and, on the other, Unionists will
                no longer be able to mount any sustainable arguments for holding
                back on the full implementation of the agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The overwhelming view of ordinary people is
                that this opportunity is one which we must take to build a new
                future based on peace and justice. It is an opportunity that
                must not be missed.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Carrick:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can assure the House that the DUP is not
                engaged in any choreography. It takes this issue seriously and
                seeks to represent its electorate honestly, openly and with
                transparency. It does not engage in half-truths. The report has
                its roots in the Belfast Agreement, an agreement which is
                repugnant to many Unionists — 50% of the Unionist family
                rejected it in the referendum. As my Colleague
                Gregory&nbsp;Campbell has indicated, that is a significant
                section of the community whose wishes cannot be set aside or
                treated lightly. The electorate was faithfully warned by the DUP
                of the ramifications of endorsing the agreement and today we are
                confronted by the fruit of the seeds sown in the negotiations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In spite of the attempts of some Unionists to
                justify their treacherous actions, the price to be paid for a
                local, accountable Assembly at Stormont will prove to be a
                ransom, irretrievably linked to machinery designed to envelop
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland in an all-Ireland ethos and, eventually,
                in a unitary state. Given the trend of events, it seems that the
                pledges given by the Prime Minister, the promises given by the
                First Minister (Designate) and the other pious platitudes given
                by the supporters of the First Minister (Designate) are
                meaningless and worthless.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the report is not the determination
                sought by Irish Nationalists and Republicans, it is a
                delayed-action mechanism to forestall the inevitable. Whether
                today or on 15&nbsp;February, the reality is — and the
                electorate of Northern&nbsp;Ireland must be aware of this —
                that democracy will be polluted and that Irish Republicans,
                inextricably linked to terrorism, will be admitted into the
                Executive. Unrepentant terrorist representatives will enter
                Government with their war machine not dismantled and their
                murderous weapons not decommissioned in a direct contravention
                of the agreement that they signed. On page&nbsp;9,
                section&nbsp;35, under &quot;Transitional Arrangements&quot;,
                says</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;In this transitional period, those
                members of the Assembly serving as shadow Ministers shall affirm
                their commitment to non-violence and exclusively peaceful and
                democratic means&quot; —</p>

                threat of force by others for any political purpose.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Has Sinn Fein/IRA demonstrated that it
                intends only to follow the purely democratic process?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no reference to decommissioning in
                this report, and the absence of such a fundamental tenet
                indicates the report’s weakness. Many Unionists in the
                constituencies are watching anxiously to see how their public
                representatives view the report. It is known that some Ulster
                Unionist Assembly Members are unhappy and uncomfortable with it
                and that some have expressed their outright opposition to it.
                This debate affords fellow Unionists the opportunity to declare
                their positions clearly and without equivocation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have no doubt about the detrimental effect
                that adopting this report will have on the Unionist ethos, not
                to mention the political Union. There is also no doubt in the
                minds of many of the misguided Unionists who were prepared to
                give the Belfast Agreement a chance that they did not vote for
                an agenda which included unrepentant terrorists or their
                representatives in Government or for the creation of all-Ireland
                bodies to take executive decisions. Neither did they support the
                agreement to see the corruption of democracy that comes from
                permitting Sinn Fein/IRA to retain their terrorist capacity.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There can be no prospect of stable
                government, or the galvanising of popular support for
                government, while the democratic, political climate is affected
                by the presence of unrepentant terrorists in government. There
                can be no credibility while the capacity exists for a return to
                terrorism by those pretending to work the democratic process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Not only is this report flawed by its dubious
                foundation in the Belfast Agreement, but it also fails to
                address, in a comprehensive manner, the issues tasked to the
                First Minister (Designate) and the Deputy First Minister
                (Designate) by the Assembly on 1&nbsp;July&nbsp;1998.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Despite the passage of six and a half months,
                notwithstanding an interim report on
                14&nbsp;September&nbsp;1998, this report today patently fails to
                address a considerable number of functional responsibilities —
                something which has already been admitted by the First Minister
                (Designate).</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wonder if the oversight had something to do
                with the overwhelming desire to accommodate unrepentant
                terrorists in the Government and to find positions for them,
                leaving aside these other functional areas. It would seem,
                according to the Deputy First Minister (Designate), that the
                idea was maximum inclusion. I can understand that concept, but
                it must not be at the expense of effective and efficient
                government. The objective of creating the machinery for these
                structures was abandoned in this case to placate Irish
                Nationalism and Irish Republicanism, thus creating jobs for the
                boys. It is anticipated that the unnecessary Departments will
                cost the taxpayer in the region of £90&nbsp;million per year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In terms of the efficiency of the proposed
                Departments I believe that the degree of fragmentation will
                prove to be a bureaucratic nightmare. There is overlap in the
                area of higher education, agriculture and rural development, and
                we have protection of the countryside and regional development,
                all falling into different bailiwicks. That will not prove to be
                a workable or a manageable way forward in terms of efficiency
                and effectiveness.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The electorate demands efficient and
                effective government. This is supposed to be an honourable
                institution, and we want it to remain an institution which
                cannot be contaminated by unrepentant terrorists. This
                institution must deliver accountable government on the basis of
                the normal principles of democracy. The report fails to
                establish the basis for the delivery of such an administration.
                I will be voting to reject it on the basis that it will not
                provide efficient government, that it does not address the
                essential requirement of decommissioning and that it also gives
                all-Ireland bodies the power to take executive decisions, thus
                impugning the political sovereignty and integrity of Northern
                Ireland.</p>

                bith ann nach gcuirfimis an Coiste Feidhmiúcháin agus an
                Chomhairle Aireachta uile-Éireann ar bun láithreach.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Fein has repeatedly stated the view that
                the reaching of agreement on Good Friday was not an end point
                but an important stage in building a bridge from the conflict of
                the past to a future where we can all work together for the good
                of all our people. It is in this context that we judge this
                report. The dynamic operation of all-Ireland structures can be
                an important engine for reconciliation throughout the island.
                Without the all-Ireland dimension there would have been no Good
                Friday Agreement. Of course, it was understood that in the
                agreement the Ministerial Council and the Assembly are mutually
                interdependent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nationalists who voted for the Good Friday
                Agreement attach considerable importance to the remit, strength
                and dynamic of the Ministerial Council and the all-Ireland
                bodies. Their effect should be to diminish the negative impact
                of over 70&nbsp;years of partition and to encourage common
                purpose in unified actions throughout the island on a wide range
                of social and economic areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we first received the scant interim
                report from the First Minister (Designate) and the Deputy First
                Minister (Designate) on 14&nbsp;September&nbsp;1998, Sinn Fein
                made an initial written response, which included proposals for
                seven implementation bodies, and seven areas for co-operation on
                the basis of common policy but separate implementation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The implementation bodies were to cover the
                Irish language, inward investment, trade promotion and
                indigenous company development, trading and employment, EU
                programmes, EU agriculture and fisheries policy and tourism.
                They were also to cover areas of common policy in education,
                transport, community development, health, arts and heritage,
                environment and energy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We had bilateral discussions with the Irish
                Government, the SDLP, Alliance and the Women’s Coalition. We
                participated in a series of round table discussions chaired by
                the First and Deputy First Ministers (Designate). Our party
                leader also discussed our proposals with both Governments, the
                First Minister (Designate) and Deputy First Minister
                (Designate).</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The two Governments were happy about the
                establishment of eight all-island implementation bodies. On the
                night of Tony&nbsp;Blair’s visit to Belfast, the Ulster
                Unionists also agreed to that, only to resile from it the
                following day. Subsequently, the UUP endlessly protracted
                discussions to minimise what eventually emerged.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the negotiations that led to the Good
                Friday Agreement, there was a clear understanding that, in
                return for embracing strand one and the Assembly in particular,
                Nationalists would have the compensation of strand two, with the
                all-Ireland Ministerial Council and the implementation bodies.
                However, since the Assembly was established in shadow mode, the
                Ulster Unionists and other Unionists have prevented the
                establishment of the all-Ireland Ministerial Council and
                minimised the remit and importance of the implementation bodies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Fein rejected the UUP’s proposal that
                it should identify three implementation bodies, with as little
                substance or impact as they could, with any credibility,
                suggest, and that the Nationalists in this state, together with
                the Irish Government, should be left with only three bodies of
                their choosing. That is what was agreed on 18&nbsp;December,
                with even those bodies greatly restricted in their functions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As negotiations came to a close, agreements
                were reached with the UUP that fell short, in Sinn Fein’s
                view, of what should have been achieved. The decisions to remove
                inward investment from the trade promotion and inward investment
                body, to restrict further its powers in relation to business
                development, to limit the number of implementation bodies to the
                absolute minimum laid down in the agreement and to make the
                tourism body a publicly-owned limited company, rather than an
                implementation body as before, were taken without Sinn Fein’s
                support.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those decisions were negative and
                unnecessary. Even now, the &quot;Poor David&quot; card is
                played. There is no indication that the UUP intends to implement
                even what they agreed on 18&nbsp;December.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with what my Colleagues said today
                about the urgent need to establish all the institutions without
                delay. Ulster Unionist Members and others have said that they
                wish to make progress and implement the agreement. I welcome
                that. However, what is the best way to achieve the forward
                movement that we all seek? Is it through exclusion? Is it
                through demonisation? Is it through blocking and making
                preconditions? Or is it through people working together in
                co-operation?</p>
                <b>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report is largely factual, setting out
                details of meetings and negotiations over the past few weeks. It
                has been referred to as &quot;treachery&quot;,
                &quot;fraud&quot;, &quot;a juggernaut&quot;, &quot;a blank
                cheque&quot; and &quot;a corruption of the democratic
                process&quot; by those whose heads are still firmly stuck in the
                sands of yesteryear.</p>
                <i>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But for those who have a vision of a better
                society, those who want to look towards the future, who want to
                cast off the shackles of the past, another piece of the jigsaw
                is being put in place — another step is being taken towards
                fulfilling people’s hopes as expressed by their overwhelming
                support of the Good Friday Agreement. This is a step towards
                normality, towards a time when people will have accountable
                government; it is a step further along the road to stability.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I could spend a lot of time debating the
                number of proposed Departments, or why such-and-such a function
                is included in Department X rather than in Department Y, or why
                the six specified areas — transport, agriculture, et cetera
                — were identified as suitable for North/South co-operation, or
                why the implementation bodies are as outlined in
                paragraph&nbsp;4.3.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I could criticise the apparent lack of detail
                on the British-Irish Council and the absence of progress on the
                Civic Forum. I could protest that today is not determination day
                when the Executive will be established thus enabling power to be
                devolved. But to what avail? The tone of today’s debate does
                not lend itself to any critical analysis of the report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We charged the First Minister (Designate) and
                the Deputy First Minister (Designate) with a task which is
                outlined in the introduction to the report. This is the latest
                report on progress, and I welcome it. I welcome progress because
                the people wish to see progress; they wish to see the full
                implementation of the Good Friday Agreement as soon as is
                humanly possible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many of us feel that since we were elected
                the pace of progress has been extremely slow, that the lack of
                trust which exists in some quarters — and in large measure —
                is thwarting the desire of the electorate. The agreement
                acknowledged the substantial differences between continuing and
                equally legitimate political aspirations. However, there was
                also a commitment to strive, in every practical way, towards
                reconciliation and rapprochement within the framework of
                democratic and agreed arrangements. All who supported the
                agreement pledged that we would work in good faith to ensure the
                success of all of the arrangements that it established.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But are all those people who commended the
                agreement to the people and received their overwhelming
                endorsement sticking to their side of the bargain? I do not mean
                sticking to their interpretation of the agreement, but, rather,
                are they trying to see it from the other person’s perspective?
                This lack of trust&nbsp;— particularly between Unionists and
                Nationalists — is tangible. It strikes me that little or no
                attempt has been made by some Unionists to understand fully the
                difficulties of their political opponents. Likewise, Sinn Fein,
                in particular, has done little, if anything, to recognise the
                problems of the Ulster Unionists. The two sides are still
                apparently seeking victory over each other and are creating or
                maintaining obstacles to progress rather than helping each other
                overcome them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One key factor is, undoubtedly, the question
                of decommissioning. But what have the great &quot;no-men&quot;
                done to try to get this problem resolved? The Ulster Unionists
                have stated that they will not sit in an Executive with Sinn
                Fein unless and until decommissioning has commenced. On the
                other hand, Sinn Fein maintains that it is fulfilling its
                commitments under the agreement, that it is working
                constructively and in good faith with the independent commission
                and is using any influence it may have to achieve
                decommissioning of all paramilitary arms within two years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Each side is continuing to sit on its high
                horse and accuse the other of bad faith.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Each may well have a point and can certainly
                justify its position to its supporters, but neither can justify
                its position to the other side. I contend that each is therefore
                breaking its pledge to the great mass of people who are
                demanding that we all work together to ensure the success of the
                whole agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The vultures — whose aim it is to wreck the
                whole process and, ironically, to deny the voice of the majority
                as delivered in the referendum — are gloating and gaining
                succour from the present stand-off. They are still fighting the
                referendum campaign. Do they not understand that they have lost
                that fight? They tell us that they are being ignored — we have
                heard it again today — and that the agreement is being forced
                down their throats. My response to that is &quot;Come off
                it&quot;. They ran away from the negotiations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not believe that either the vast
                majority of Ulster Unionists, or Sinn Fein, wish to give victory
                to these abominable &quot;no-men&quot;. I do not believe that
                either camp wishes to destroy the hopes or aspirations of 72% of
                the people who voted &quot;yes&quot;. I do not believe that
                either camp wishes to walk away from that which has been
                achieved to date. They do not wish to see something which has
                positive potential being replaced by the certainty of negative
                despair. This report can be viewed, in some respects, like a
                wheelbarrow. We are using it to push the load in front of us,
                but we cannot keep on pushing forever. Some of us may be getting
                tired of pushing, and the people are certainly getting tired of
                watching us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can approve this report because it
                designates &quot;D-day&quot;. February 15 is only a matter of
                days away. I urge all to share the remaining problems, to
                demonstrate again the courage which brought about the Good
                Friday Agreement, and to deliver to the people that which again
                appears to be impossible. Who would have thought that we could
                have come so far in 12&nbsp;months? Many courageous steps have
                already been taken on all sides. We are tantalisingly close.
                Another few steps and we gain the summit. We cannot let
                stubbornness, tiredness or anything else get in our way now. No
                one, but no one, can give up now. Compromise has brought us thus
                far, and compromise must again be practised to bring to
                fulfilment our pledge to the people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Time is short, but with patience,
                determination and goodwill on all sides, I am convinced that the
                remaining time can be put to good use. We must all get around
                the table and thrash out a solution to the remaining problems.
                Let us not, for heaven’s sake, spend the next few weeks
                closeted in our offices blaming everyone but ourselves. It is
                time for everyone to stop digging holes which are already deep
                enough. If those with the spades do not stop digging now, then
                the holes will collapse around them and bury them in failure. It
                is time for everyone to climb out of the holes and get to the
                negotiating table because, as we have demonstrated before, the
                solution can only be found through talking.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to commend this report, particularly
                the aspects relating to both North/South (strand two) and
                East/West (strand three) relationships. First of all, what did
                the Belfast Agreement, and, indeed, the Northern Ireland Act
                1998, say about the accountability of North/South bodies?
                Decisions made by the North/South Ministerial Council are to be
                with the agreement of both sides — Strand Two. I quote from
                paragraph 11:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The implementation bodies will have a

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the second paragraph emphasises,</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Operating in accordance with the rules
                for democratic authority and accountability in force in the
                Northern Ireland Assembly.&quot;</p>

                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fact that the North/South Ministerial
                Council will be operating under the rules for accountability in
                force in the Assembly and in the Dublin parliament does not mean
                that the Council will be accountable to the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Furthermore, the agreement, at
                paragraph&nbsp;6, says</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Each side to remain accountable to the

                decisions beyond the defined authority of those attending.&quot;</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This means that approval is not required for

                attending.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Birnie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 52 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998
                prescribes cross-community representation amongst participating
                Northern Ireland Ministers, and this is an important point. It
                further provides for these Ministers to report back to the
                Executive and the Assembly. The Act also states that after the
                appointed day for transfer of powers no further implementation
                bodies shall be set up without the agreement of the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to commend the proposals made in
                respect of the six implementation bodies. First, by formalising
                existing areas of co-operation, we will be able to make
                administrative improvements, for example, with regard to inland
                waterways and the drafting of the relevant common chapter of the
                Structural Funds Plan.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, there are clear issues of public
                interest. Information could be shared between Governments in
                Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland to deal with common
                difficulties — for example, in the work of the food safety
                body on matters such as food poisoning and animal disease.
                Mutual benefits will also be gained through the agreement of
                property rights, probably including the clearer demarcation of
                the frontier in Lough Foyle and Carlingford Lough. This is why
                we proposed the creation of the body with responsibility for
                aquaculture and marine matters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the body with responsibility for trade and
                business development can bring about improvements in trade,
                supply and procurement on both sides of the border, and this
                improves the employment situation in both parts of the island,
                then this will clearly be a win-win situation. I have tended to
                be sceptical about whether there really are substantial economic
                barriers between the two parts of the island, although there may
                be certain psychological barriers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the new trade body can help to persuade
                managers of firms in the Republic of Ireland that Northern
                Ireland companies are not hopelessly crippled by violence and
                instability, and, conversely, if it can convince managers in
                Northern Ireland that customers from the Republic of Ireland
                will settle their bills on time, then it will be doing a good
                job.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, we want to improve the
                accountability of those already involved in existing
                cross-border co-operation. Thus, the special EU programmes body
                will assume responsibility for the evaluation and monitoring of
                the INTERREG programmes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fourthly, we anticipate that, in time, some
                of the North/South links created under strand two will be
                mirrored by similar East/West bodies, as dictated by mutual
                interest, as, for example, in the case of food safety and
                language promotion. This will be done through the British-Irish
                Council.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One final consideration which illustrates the
                balanced nature of these proposals relates to the art of policy
                making, especially economic policy making, which is based on
                matching up policy-making institutions with policy objectives.
                At a time when, after a gap of a quarter of a century, power may
                be returned to local bodies, we have ensured that the major
                institutions concerned with economic and industrial policy are
                to remain under the control of Northern Ireland policy makers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Industrial Development Board, with its
                inward investment function, will continue to exist. Over the
                years, many people, including myself, have been critical of the
                Industrial Development Board, but I am reminded of the story of
                the reaction of President Roosevelt when he was told that the
                contemporary leader of Guatemala was &quot;a bloody
                despot&quot;. Roosevelt replied &quot;Well, at least he’s our
                bloody despot.&quot;</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members may be aware that Roosevelt often
                used more colourful language than that. At least the IDB remains
                our institution; we can keep it under our direction to improve
                its performance. When we can work with the Republic of Ireland
                on industrial policy, we will do so. Where there is competition,
                that co-operation must necessarily be limited in our own
                economic interests. Similarly, we have kept under the exclusive
                control of Northern Ireland policy makers such organisations as
                the Tourist Board, the Local Enterprise Development Unit, the
                Training and Employment Agency and the Technology Unit.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the report. It is about realising
                what the Belfast Agreement called mutual interest. It is
                consistent with the historical record of practical North/South
                co-operation instituted under the Stormont Governments of the
                1950s and 1960s. Some of our colleagues probably regard Lord
                Brookeborough as a traitor as well.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There will be overarching East/West
                institutions through the British-Irish Council: Northern Ireland’s
                fundamental constitutional position within the United Kingdom
                remains the same. These international arrangements are unique;
                they are not a micromodel of European Union neofunctionalism.
                They offer the best prospect of creating a house which is both a
                warmer and a wealthier one for our peoples of various
                traditions.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Byrne:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In common with other members of my party, I
                welcome the report. It is belated but nevertheless welcome. I am
                disappointed that it is not a final report. I supported the
                18&nbsp;December agreement, because it was important for us not
                to go into the new year without reaching agreement. The people
                have expectations; they elected us to do a job. They want to see
                continued progress, with all the institutions working, including
                this Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The mood of people throughout Ireland,
                particularly in the North, has been driven up and down since the
                referendum, and we have to be conscious of that mood. We have
                lived through 30&nbsp;years of terrible pain. The public have
                paid a terrible price for political instability, and they do not
                want us to renege on our responsibilities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have a mandate for the agreement, and as
                Nationalists, we got that mandate from all of Ireland. Parties
                cannot use it as a political takeaway. We must take it forward
                in its entirety, and we all have a public and political duty to
                overcome the remaining obstacles. On the Nationalist side, there
                is concern about Unionist intentions. Equally, on the Unionist
                side, there is concern about the intentions of some
                Nationalists. Trust has to be built, and I think that we are
                beginning to achieve that. This debate will help in that task.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the setting up of
                10&nbsp;Departments, and I do not regard the alleged extra cost
                of £90&nbsp;million as a terrible crime. The people of Northern
                Ireland are looking for better government, and the 10
                Departments will allow a better distribution of devolved
                government functions. Within the office of the First Minister
                (Designate) and the Deputy First Minister (Designate) there is
                to be an economic policy unit. I welcome that because this
                region is not performing well economically.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Where is Ulster pride? We depend on
                £4&nbsp;billion a year from Great Britain. One of the major
                tasks of the Assembly and the economic policy unit will be to
                devise a strategy to get away from that level of dependency. In
                terms of equality, we are pleased that the unit is to be sited
                in the office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister.
                Equality should not be pursued in a piecemeal way. It must be
                driven from the centre, and it must be implemented in all
                Departments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Colleague Sean Farren spoke about the
                setting up of a scrutiny committee for equality, and I think
                that that has also been accepted by Unionists. That is welcome,
                because we want to see equality implemented in all its facets.
                We do not want any further alienation on either the Unionist
                side or the Nationalist side over the way decisions are made.
                That has contributed enormously to our problems.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The work of the Assembly can be driven
                practically and effectively through its Committee system. The
                sooner that we can get the Departments and the relevant
                Committees set up, the sooner we will be able to conduct our
                business more effectively and efficiently.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committees have the potential to reflect
                a most important political dynamic for the effective and
                efficient functioning of the departments. The agreement refers
                to how these Committees may work. As I see it, they can play an
                effective role in policy formulation, and every party in the
                Assembly will be able to contribute to that. The Committees can
                scrutinise Departments and check on how they are performing.
                Each Committee will be the public’s guardian of how executive
                functions are being carried out. The Committees can hold
                Ministers to account for the work that they will be doing. They
                can also carry out consultation exercises by inviting experts
                from outside. The Committees must be seen to function in a
                constructive and consensual way, and I am convinced that that is
                where the correct genesis for the operation of this Assembly is
                to be found.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Committees can also be a forum for more
                informed and exhaustive discussion between politicians and the
                Civil Service. We all know that for the past 30&nbsp;years
                Ministers coming from Great Britain did not really understand
                the problems and the needs of our people. Civil servants have
                largely been determining policy and implementing it. I do not
                blame them for the way in which the place has been run, but a
                stronger political input into policy formulation by local
                politicians would have been more effective.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Policy formulation can be made more effective
                and specific to our needs. That terrible problem of the
                democratic deficit can be addressed. Those of us who have been
                councillors for years are aware of the difficulties in trying to
                lobby on issues in our constituencies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the North/South bodies, all Departments
                will have a role. I welcome what Mr Roche said about this
                subject, but why should we be so afraid of this? This is a small
                region with 1.5 million people. We do not want to continue
                living in splendid isolation. Economics should determine that we
                co-operate. Golden Vale, the Kerry Group and other companies
                from the South have made investments in the North. I want to see
                Northern Ireland companies investing in the Republic as Glen
                Dimplex, the Sean Quinn Group and the Hastings Group have done.
                Let us encourage and facilitate that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">European Union initiatives dictate that we,
                as a region, should have an effective, cross-border development
                strategy for social and economic gain. I live in a border
                constituency, and I know the problems of neglect in relation to
                infrastructure. Regional development will play an important role
                in those peripheral areas, and it will happen only if there is

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want the road from Dublin to Derry, the A5,
                which runs through my constituency, and the A4 through Fermanagh
                to be upgraded. We have been deprived of investment in the past.
                I am not blaming anybody for that, but we were disadvantaged by
                an economic border.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report signals the death throes of
                democracy in Northern Ireland. We have been fatally wounded by
                the Belfast Agreement, and the report aims to hammer the final
                nails into the coffin of the cause which so many have given
                their lives to defend. Paragraph&nbsp;3.7 of the report states</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We want to agree upon and implement a
                programme for government that will succeed in delivering
                efficient, accountable, transparent government&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The irony would have been too great for the
                authors of the document to include the word
                &quot;democratic&quot; in the description of the style of
                government they claim to strive for.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We in the DUP have remained firm in our
                demand that only seven Departments should be created. Those who
                are in the habit of caving in to Republican pressure have
                created the potential for a system of government that is far
                from efficient. A scenario has been proposed in which
                £90&nbsp;million is to be squandered on the demands of
                pan-Nationalism for three extra Ministerial posts so that they
                will gain a wholly disproportionate number of Executive
                positions. That form of government cannot be described as
                democratic.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To be efficient, a Government must be
                effective and should waste as little as possible. The proposal
                will waste £90&nbsp;million that could be spent on an ailing
                Heath Service in which patients must wait weeks for urgent
                surgery, or on upgrading our crumbling and inadequate roads. We
                are being blackmailed on this issue in that if the port of
                Belfast is not privatised we do not get the improvements. It
                seems that pan-Nationalism demands, and pan-Nationalism gets.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The accountable government spoken about in
                the report is not that which we would be familiar with or
                desire. Through the Belfast Agreement, accountability is to the
                terrorist and the gunman, and to them alone. It is at the whim
                of Gerry&nbsp;Adams and the Republican movement with their
                stockpiles of AK47s and Semtex. They are unchanged, and are
                pledged never to change. They are unconditionally committed to
                the destruction of this country — should that be through
                violence or the threat of violence, whichever brings the greater
                rewards. This report propagates the lie that peace is possible
                only through such concessions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fact that ongoing negotiations between a
                number of parties on the implementation of North/South bodies is
                leading to a final report, as described in this document, is
                most worrying. Proposals will not be part of a recommendation or
                part of a greater consultative process. They will result in a
                final report which suggests that the reality of North/South
                bodies is that their structures and substance will continue to
                be developed, irrespective of events within or without this
                Assembly. Many people will claim that these North/South bodies
                will be answerable to the Assembly.</p>
                <i>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Should the Assembly cease to function, which
                would happen if, for example, the Ulster Unionist Party were to
                walk out, these embryonic all-Ireland Departments would continue
                to operate and would be answerable to no one but themselves and
                Dublin. Those who call themselves Unionists or democrats are
                morally bound to oppose this sordid deal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The British-Irish Agreement is no more than
                the Anglo-Irish Agreement dressed up as democracy. We have had
                many examples of 1980s revivals recently, such as Culture Club,
                Duran Duran and the Human League, but this must be the poorest
                attempt yet by the NIO at a comeback. It is a poor cover version
                of an even poorer original publication.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members might think that Maryfield is
                closed and that the Anglo-Irish Agreement is defunct. That is a
                fabrication and a falsehood. Maryfield may have closed, but the
                same personnel have been transferred to Windsor House in Bedford
                Street to await their make-over. The Anglo-Irish Agreement is
                proceeding at full steam in the run up to its rechristening as
                the British-Irish Agreement. Dublin still interferes, thereby
                creating instability in all aspects of life in Northern Ireland,
                and that looks set to continue. As with the egotistic and
                immoral claims observed in the Irish constitution, the
                principles of the Anglo-Irish Agreement will disappear only when
                they are obsolete, when claims are fulfilled and when bodies
                cease to be required in order to gain constitutional leverage
                over the neighbouring jurisdiction.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is one notable omission in all of this,
                and it is the major detail of the decommissioning of terrorist
                arsenals. The document rambles on about efficient, accountable
                and transparent government, but there is no mention of the arms
                that are possessed by the very people who demand places on the
                Executive and who would be so facilitated by the ratification of
                the document. The Secretary of State is closing her eyes and
                ears to the hundreds of terrorist acts committed since the
                signing of the agreement. She has said</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;It is not a question of if
                decommissioning is going to take place, it’s a question of
                when.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The cynic could be forgiven for interpreting
                this as &quot;It is not a question of if there will be a United
                Ireland, but a question of when&quot;, because only then may the
                IRA decide that it no longer requires its guns. That is stated
                in the IRA’s constitution. It was reported in the ‘Belfast
                Telegraph’ that in a telephone conversation to Tony&nbsp;Blair
                on 20&nbsp;September last year Gerry&nbsp;Adams said</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Britain created the problem in Ireland
                … The British Government therefore has a major role in
                initiating a strategy which will bring a … resolution and
                lasting peace … The aim … must be to seek to change British
                policy from one of upholding the union to one of ending the
                union.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was Adams and his colleagues who starved
                Ulster of the peace it desired. The &quot;strategy&quot; of
                which he speaks is that of creating a pathway to a united
                Ireland. The message is clear. If that is not done, a lasting
                peace will not be delivered, and guess who will be pulling the
                triggers of the guns that we want to see destroyed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The DUP will not be pulling the triggers, nor
                will any other truly democratic and constitutional party be
                detonating the bombs. The IRA will once again be the cause of
                conflict in Ulster. The IRA has bombed its way into this
                Assembly, and it continues to make demands. The policy of the
                ballot box in one hand and the Armalite in the other, seems to
                have been replaced by a policy of the ballot box in one hand and
                the threat of the Armalite in the other.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On Thursday night there was a serious threat
                against Newry RUC Station. It was not reported by the press but
                RUC officers were prepared for an IRA attack.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The DUP, together with its anti-agreement,
                pro-democracy colleagues, has been consistent in its demand that
                only through total decommissioning could those who have wreaked
                death and destruction across this country for more than 30 years
                be admitted to the democratic process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The terrorists believe that they can control
                people through violence without the practice of such savagery
                contaminating their political ideals. Acts of barbarity are
                committed almost daily, yet prisoners continue to be released
                and re-offend. That cannot be accepted in any democratic
                society. I hope that all democrats in the House will agree that
                it is not acceptable for these men to take any position in the
                Government of Northern Ireland while they retain and maintain
                their murderous capability.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I reject the claim that broad cross-community
                support has been received for the statement of 18&nbsp;December.
                The majority of the Unionist people are now totally opposed to
                this evil and thoroughly rotten process. There is no support for
                the creation of a completely undemocratic Civic Forum. The only
                people who might be interested in this waste of time and money
                are those who could not obtain a democratic mandate to enter the
                Assembly. The existence of such a body is devoid of any
                democratic principle.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following the murder of Andrew&nbsp;Kearney
                last year, Reg&nbsp;Empey said that that put Sinn Fein in a very
                difficult position. The only squirming that I have observed
                during this debate has been by Ulster Unionist Members in the
                benches to the left of me as some of them have attempted to
                justify their past words and deeds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In one corner we have IRA/Sinn Fein dealing
                in fractures and in the other corner we have John&nbsp;Taylor,
                the Member for Strangford, dealing in fractions. But
                Mr&nbsp;Taylor does not know whether he is a mathematician or a
                magician. He is a mathematician when it comes to adding the
                figures up, and he is a magician when it comes to making a
                40-foot barge pole disappear in seconds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I quote Lord&nbsp;Carson:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;of all the men in my experience that I
                think are the most loathsome it is those who will sell their
                friends for the purpose of conciliating their enemies and,
                perhaps, still worse, the men who climb up a ladder into power
                of which even I may have been a part of a humble rung, and then,
                when they have got to the top and power, kick the ladder away
                without any concern for the pain, or injury, or mischief or
                damage they do to those who have helped them to gain
                power.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of the Members in this Assembly might do
                well to think about Carson’s words.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The thrust of this report, far from giving
                efficient, accountable and transparent government is no more
                than an exercise in political expediency. This process is
                accountable only to the gunman and, as a direct result, is
                muddied with lies and deception.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Fein welcomes the provision for setting
                up the consultative Civic Forum in paragraph 34 of the Good
                Friday Agreement, in the legislation and on page&nbsp;8 of this
                report. Sinn Fein is contributing constantly to the development
                of all the structures under the agreement, and that includes the
                Civic Forum.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The signing of the Good Friday Agreement
                signalled a shift away from the unrepresentative and
                undemocratic structures which have existed in the North since
                partition. We welcome the fact that the new structures of
                Government are to embrace the democratic principles of equality
                of representation and of accountability and that they will be
                all-Ireland in character.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Part of this new dispensation is the
                establishment of an innovative consultative body — the Civic
                Forum. Sinn Fein believes that the development of the Civic
                Forum will complement the work of the Assembly, add to the
                quality of decision making and include marginalised groups in
                the democratic structures. We want to see the Civic Forum
                progress expeditiously because we believe it will facilitate the
                process towards democracy and change. But, no matter how much we
                may want to see it up and running, it is important that those
                Members in the sub-group charged with making recommendations
                ensure that they get it right. We must give our best efforts and
                quality time to the steps that need to be taken to establish the
                Civic Forum.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We may not succeed, but we have to advance
                cautiously. There is no imperative, other than the personal
                opinions of the First Minister (Designate) and the Deputy First
                Minister (Designate), to determine the quality of the Civic
                Forum. The principles which should form the process and underpin
                its final development should be secondary to the timetable for
                the establishment and operation of the Forum itself. Sinn Fein
                believes it is much more judicious to ensure that the Civic
                Forum delivers from the start what everyone expects from it. If
                we get it right, it will revolutionise the relationship between
                people and politics and remove any suspicion and cynicism about
                the Civic Forum’s becoming a club for the great and the good.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are those in the Chamber who do not
                want to see a Civic Forum set up. But we who do want this body
                know that we are building bridges which we all need to cross.
                The Assembly, in conjunction with the Civic Forum, needs to
                promote the principles of equality, accessibility, transparency
                and accountability. These are not mere words. They are core
                values that should not only apply to the working of the Civic
                Forum but to the working of the Assembly as well. They must also
                be central to the deliberations of the sub-group. The
                submissions received to date represent, according to the
                advisers, a narrow cross-section of civic society in the North.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The 70% of people who voted for the Good
                Friday Agreement, of which the Civic Forum is a part, want such
                a body — indeed, all the institutions of the Assembly — to
                reflect the confidence that they have placed in those whom they
                have elected. They want to see a Civic Forum set up whose
                purpose will be to imbed these core principles and to restore
                and build trust.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Fein upholds the principles which
                underpin the agreement and has submitted proposals, consistent
                with equality, accessibility, transparency and accountability,
                that will help devise the mechanism for delivering the Civic
                Forum. As a party, it will not rubber-stamp any proposals that
                do not have, as a central tenet, the principle of equality.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is the responsibility of those who have
                argued that equality can be assured and achieved in the
                institutions under the direct control of the First and the
                Deputy First Ministers (Designate) — and that policy has been
                established under the agreement — to demonstrate now that
                membership of the Civic Forum will be explicitly, directly and
                systematically equality-proofed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We in the sub-group are mindful of this. That
                is why the report presented today by the First and the Deputy
                First Ministers (Designate) does not include proposals for the
                setting up of the Civic Forum. We have agreed some aspects of
                the Forum, such as the working arrangements, but there are still
                issues of a fundamental nature which need to be addressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was surprised when I heard Mr&nbsp;McGimpsey
                saying on the ‘Inside Politics’ programme that the Forum had
                been put to bed. I can assure Mr&nbsp;McGimpsey that we have not
                agreed on the quality of the mattress yet. I believe that the
                sub-group needs to continue its work of ensuring that the
                process which creates the Civic Forum itself also promotes
                active citizenship and participatory democracy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this way the Civic Forum will become the

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I reject the motion tabled by the First and
                Deputy First Ministers (Designate) and support the amendment in
                the names of Dr&nbsp;Ian&nbsp;Paisley and
                Mr&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;Robinson.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Northern Ireland Unionist Party’s
                position is that the focus on departmental structures is further
                marginalising the core issue of the decommissioning of terrorist
                arsenals. Proposals on departmental structures should exclude
                parties which front terrorist organisations that are refusing to
                decommission their arsenals and dismantle their paramilitary
                structures.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us examine the attitude of the SDLP, a
                party which throughout 30&nbsp;years of terror has constantly
                condemned violence but has not hesitated to profit politically
                from that violence. This requirement presents the SDLP with a
                clear choice between supporting democratic practice and the
                integrity of the rule of law or supporting Sinn Fein/IRA’s
                demands to participate in the Executive — that is, in the
                Government of Northern Ireland — while retaining its terrorist
                arsenal and structures.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the SDLP supports Sinn Fein in its refusal
                to decommission its terrorist arsenal and dismantle its
                terrorist structures the former will render itself
                indistinguishable from Sinn Fein/IRA.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The alternative is for the SDLP to align
                itself with the fundamental, democratic demand that Sinn
                Fein/IRA must decommission its terrorist arsenal and dismantle
                its terrorist structures. The pro-Union community, rightly, will
                not tolerate government by an Executive that includes the
                architects of the terrorism that has been directed against them
                for 30 years, while the IRA retains its arsenal and its
                structures for use at its discretion. Such a situation is
                unthinkable and totally unacceptable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The obligation on the United Kingdom
                Government to demand decommissioning is reinforced by the clear
                impression conveyed by the Prime Minister, and which was a
                crucial part of the referendum campaign, that decommissioning
                would be a condition of Sinn Fein/IRA taking its seats in the
                Executive. This impression was given on at least the following
                occasions: speeches at Balmoral and the University of Ulster;
                the Prime&nbsp;Minister’s handwritten pledges; the letter to
                Mr Trimble on 10&nbsp;April&nbsp;1998; and statements by the
                Prime&nbsp;Minister to Parliament.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The law-abiding majority in Northern Ireland
                wants a stable society in which citizens can go about their
                lives in peace. Ordinary people find the struggle of bringing up
                their families, the stresses of modern life, the needs of
                elderly relatives and others enough to contend with, without
                being subject to the political dictate of parties fronting
                terrorist organisations with the aim of destabilising and
                overthrowing their society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A stable, prosperous Northern Ireland is what
                most people would settle for; a stable Northern Ireland is the
                objective that I strive for. A minority has no interest in a
                stable society in Northern Ireland; it is only interested in
                instability. Instability is its way of life and it thrives on
                it. Unfortunately for the tens of thousands of innocent victims
                of violence, and the many hundreds of thousands whose lives have
                been disrupted by bombings and social dislocation, who have had
                to move house or rebuild businesses, it is not only the
                revolutionaries, or counter-revolutionaries, who appear to have
                a vested interest in instability. Many have concluded that the
                British Government are indifferent to Northern Ireland’s
                position within the United Kingdom.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Lip-service is given to the concept of the
                Union. Daily events on the ground undermine any confidence that
                ordinary people might have in the sincerity of the British
                Government’s desire to uphold the rule of law and to protect
                democracy. In spite of what some would tell us, Northern Ireland
                is in greater danger than it has been for the last 30 years. The
                Union with Great Britain has been weakened and our citizenship
                of the United Kingdom eroded. In recent years Government
                officials and Ulster Unionist politicians have entered talks
                with Sinn&nbsp;Fein/IRA. We have seen the early release of
                terrorists, the national anthem banned in the university, the
                national flag — the Union Jack — and portraits of the Queen
                removed from the workplace. In the courts, Queen’s Counsel are
                no longer obliged to swear an oath of allegiance. Orange halls
                have been burned, and there has been an orchestrated campaign to
                ban and re-route traditional Orange and Loyalist parades. This
                campaign is spearheaded by residents’ groups, many of which
                contain convicted IRA terrorists.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nevertheless the majority of those elected do
                not, and will never, consent to a united Ireland. So powerful is
                the yearning and desire of the majority of the people in
                Northern Ireland for Britishness and the Union that all
                elections since the inception of Northern&nbsp;Ireland show an
                unwavering majority of votes in favour of the Union and a
                British identity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Throughout 30&nbsp;years of the most
                horrendous terrorist campaign which any civil society has been
                called on to endure, the will of the majority for the
                maintenance of the Union with Great Britain was never broken,
                even in circumstances where the Republic of Ireland provided a
                safe haven for Irish Republican terrorists. In 1998 there were
                55 murders, 40 after the signing of the Belfast Agreement on
                10&nbsp;April&nbsp;1998 and 500 punishment beatings and
                shootings. More than 200 terrorists have been released early and
                have taken up their paramilitary activities where they left off.
                Surgeons have recently stated that punishment beatings and
                shootings are increasing in ferocity, including deliberate
                attempts by the terrorists to cripple their victims permanently.
                Yet Mo&nbsp;Mowlam has stated that there is no evidence to
                confirm that these attacks have been sanctioned by terrorist
                organisations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The representatives of Sinn Fein/IRA do not
                share the common desire of ordinary people for stability. They
                are committed to a revolutionary principle. The Assembly is
                merely a transitional stage in the revolution, and whether that
                struggle is defined as armed or unarmed really depends on the
                degree of violence that the Government are prepared to tolerate
                in the name of the peace process. We have the worst of all
                possible worlds, with terrorists outside the Assembly and their
                representatives inside it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This debate gives us an opportunity to
                reflect upon a groundswell of opinion in the Unionist community
                that is moving increasingly towards a reappraisal of the
                unbalanced Belfast Agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On Friday 15&nbsp;January&nbsp;1999 the ‘News
                Letter’ quoted Vincent&nbsp;McKenna, a leading figure in the
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland anti-intimidation group FAIT, as stating
                that he would not support the Good Friday Agreement if it were
                to be put to the people in another referendum. Mr&nbsp;McKenna
                is quoted as saying</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;if a second referendum on the accord
                were to be put to a vote, I would not be voting yes.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The FAIT spokesman claimed</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The credibility of the peace process
                was being eroded by the continuing paramilitary-style attacks by
                republicans and loyalists on recognised ceasefire.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the last year there were 500 incidents
                attributable to terrorists whose organisations are in the
                process. This was admitted by the Secretary of State in the
                House of Commons on December 2nd .</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The IRA shot 38 people last year, as opposed
                to 22 the previous year, and in the last week alone the Provos
                had by Sunday shot two people and carried out seven beatings,
                while the Loyalists matched those figures.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And yet despite this terrorist activity,
                these incidents are being ignored by the British Government, are
                being sidelined by both Governments and we are facing the
                prospect of the very people who sanctioned these acts taking
                office.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is not what people who voted yes in the
                May referendum voted for. It is not what families whose loved
                ones have suffered at the hands of paramilitaries voted for.
                They feel cheated.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have the opportunity today to declare in
                favour of a civil society in which ordinary people are free from
                gangsterism, intimidation, provocation and polarisation. Those
                in the Unionist community who voted in favour of the Belfast
                Agreement because of the false promises and pledges of
                Tony&nbsp;Blair and the Government that decommissioning would
                take place have since openly admitted their errors and now
                reject the Belfast Agreement and its appeasement process. All
                Unionists elected to the Assembly must now acknowledge this
                fact.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As an elected Member for South Antrim, I am
                proud that the vast majority of the Unionist electorate in my
                constituency were aware of the danger to Northern Ireland’s
                position within the Union and totally opposed the implementation
                of all-Ireland structures and bodies in the June&nbsp;1998
                election. This opposition is growing daily in South Antrim and
                throughout Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the issue of departmental structures under
                the terms of the Belfast Agreement, the Executive is not
                accountable to the Assembly, since it would be virtually
                impossible to remove any Minister from office. I also strongly
                oppose 10 Departments. That will impose an equal number of
                Unionist and Nationalist Ministers on the Unionist majority of
                Northern Ireland, and that is a major concession by the Ulster
                Unionist Party to the pan-Nationalist front.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There would also be the significant
                administrative costs of increasing the current six Departments
                to the proposed 10 — a change designed more for political
                reasons rather than for the betterment of the taxpayer and
                greater efficiency.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no mention in the report of the
                future role and function of local government or of the large
                number of unelected quangos. There is also insufficient
                information about the appointments of members to the Civic Forum
                or about their specific roles.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Unionist community totally rejects this
                report and its contents which, if passed by the Assembly, will
                create an Executive with militant Republicans discharging
                ministerial functions. I support the amendment.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Boyd said much with which I disagree, but
                he was right to underline the fact that this report is
                incomplete. That is why it is an interim report. The final
                report is not before us but will be before the House in a month’s
                time. Leaving aside the first hour or so, when there were noisy
                interruptions from the DUP wing in particular, this has been a
                sombre and thoughtful debate on where we are going in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland. We have arrived at a very difficult point
                in the history of this Province, of this part of the
                United&nbsp;Kingdom and of this part of the island of Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We now have an interim report based on the
                Belfast Agreement of Good Friday 1998 showing us the way forward
                on the creation of an Executive comprising 10 Members from the
                four main political parties in the Assembly, on the creation of
                six bodies for co-operation between Northern&nbsp;Ireland and
                the Republic and on the creation of six bodies for the
                implementation of policies of interest common to both
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland and the Republic, policies which will be
                subject both to a veto by the Unionist Member present on that
                body and to a veto by the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other issues have been left out. We have made
                little progress on the Civic Forum, and we still have to
                complete the details of the new British-Irish Council to enable
                us to create an institution that will deal with all that we have
                in common in these British Isles — Southern Ireland,
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland and the rest of the United&nbsp;Kingdom.
                There is considerable work to do, and that is why a further
                month is required.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Belfast Agreement created problems and
                concerns for everyone. For the SDLP there are problems, for Sinn
                Fein there are many problems, for the DUP and the former UKUP
                there are many problems and for the UUP there are many problems.
                Indeed, I see that Mr&nbsp;Shannon, the DUP Member for
                Strangford, does not understand what happened. When he refers to
                the 40-foot pole he shows that he does not understand the type
                of document that we had on the Tuesday before Good Friday.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those who were involved in the negotiations
                — and the DUP did not have Mr&nbsp;Shannon there — know that
                in that document there were the 50 cross-border bodies that were
                proposed by Senator&nbsp;Mitchell. It was only by the UUP’s
                taking a firm stand and saying we would not touch it with a
                40-foot pole that that number was reduced to 12 in the agreement
                itself. Of course, the DUP does not give credit for these things
                because some of them want to score points and others, like
                Mr&nbsp;Shannon, because he does not understand.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all have concerns. There was the
                referendum. It was carried by 70% plus — fewer than 30% were
                against. If we are honest, we know that, while the overwhelming
                majority of the Catholic community voted &quot;Yes&quot;, in the
                Protestant community there was only a slim majority — just
                over 50%. That is the accurate position. Why did the
                Catholic-Nationalist community vote &quot;Yes&quot; in such
                overwhelming numbers? It voted &quot;Yes&quot; because it wanted
                to see peace established in Northern Ireland on the basis of
                partnership government. After 30&nbsp;years of violence it wants
                peace, and Sinn Fein has failed to get that message. The people
                who voted &quot;Yes&quot; were not expressing support for a
                continued ability to perpetrate violence in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland, they were actually saying &quot;We have
                had enough.&quot; Whether we are Catholic or Protestant,
                Nationalist or Unionist, we want peace and stability, with
                Catholic, Protestant, Nationalist and Unionist working together
                for the good of Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>

                achieve these things for our people. Of course, we can divide
                and go back to civil war, but that will not help the ordinary
                man in the street.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ulster Unionist Party was at one time a
                party of the Establishment. I saw that in my younger days in
                this House. Today I would call it the Poujadist party of Ulster.
                David&nbsp;Trimble is one Member at least who knows what that
                is. We will leave the other Members to look it up later. We
                share with other parties the desire to create a better society
                in Northern&nbsp;Ireland in which we will all thrive and have
                equality of opportunity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The key issue in the next month is how we
                complete the unfinished work. I do not envisage much difficulty
                in progressing with the British-Irish Council and the Civic
                Forum, but the crucial issue is whether there will continue to
                be a threat of violence in Northern Ireland.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course I am in doubt. I have always been
                in doubt about that. On Good Friday — I even remember you,
                Mr&nbsp;Initial&nbsp;Presiding&nbsp;Officer, getting a bit
                anxious about it — I delayed the agreement to the
                Mitchell&nbsp;Report because I was concerned that there was
                still the possibility of those who supported violence being in
                the Executive of the Northern&nbsp;Ireland Assembly. I still
                have those concerns. The Ulster&nbsp;Unionist Party accepts that
                there is an absence of total trust in this society. I am glad to
                hear some SDLP Members saying that trust is beginning to grow.
                That is progress.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to make it clear to Sinn Fein —
                which is the Republican movement because the IRA and
                Sinn&nbsp;Fein are the same thing — that the UUP is honourable
                in its dealings. We have no wish to exclude Sinn&nbsp;Fein from
                office out of spite, though that would be understandable in
                light of its record. The UUP remains open to new and changed
                relationships.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the people voted last year, they were
                looking forward to a new kind of Administration, embracing the
                whole spectrum of political opinion in Ulster. But they also
                voted for an end to violence and the threat of violence. So long
                as the IRA’s arsenal remains intact, the threat remains
                intact. So long as the threat remains intact, there will be no
                Executive involving those who retain that threat. I hope that
                constitutional Nationalism will recognise that and join with
                democratic parties to proceed without Sinn Fein, if necessary.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;Robinson said that the
                Ulster Unionist Party has a post-dated cheque. He is right. It
                is not the first time that I have seen a post-dated cheque —
                and such a cheque will not clear if there is no money in the
                account on the day that it is presented.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Haughey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend the report, and I wish to comment
                on some aspects of the debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The most audible aspect of the debate was the
                merriment, the guffawing, the wisecracking, the sniggering and
                the chortling from DUP Members and other anti-agreement
                Unionists. If they are right, and Ulster is being shamefully
                betrayed, they seem to be getting the most enormous enjoyment
                out of it. I have never heard such merriment and guffawing. I
                hope that the media gives an accurate picture of what happened
                here today because if all this pleading about grievance,
                betrayal, shameful letting down and sell-out is true, one must
                question such frivolity. It seems to be the best show in town.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have heard Mr&nbsp;Carrick of the DUP
                refer to the polluting of democracy by the inclusion of Sinn
                Fein in government, according to the terms of the Belfast
                Agreement. Let him look at his own party. Is it an adornment of
                democracy to seek to shout down others who have a legitimate
                point of view; to seek to waste their time by constant
                interruption; to seek to put them off their stroke by constant
                heckling and guffaws? I do not believe it is.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To more important matters. This agreement is
                an attempt to move away from a &quot;majoritarian&quot; approach
                to government in Northern&nbsp;Ireland, an approach which has
                characterised government through much of this state’s
                existence. Indeed, that &quot;majoritarian&quot; approach was at
                the heart of the conflict. We are trying to move away from that
                towards a consensus system of decision-making and government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a painful transition for many people.
                It is painful for Unionists in view of this community’s
                history, but I believe that a majority of Unionists now accept
                that there is a need to move from a majority approach to
                decision-making towards a consensus system of government and
                partnership. But the views of many anti-agreement Unionists are
                entirely incoherent on this whole matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For instance, Mr&nbsp;Gregory&nbsp;Campbell
                and others were suggesting a few minutes ago that more than 50%
                of Unionists opposed the agreement. Quite apart from whether it
                is true or not, and I do not believe that it is, implicit in
                what he has said is an insistence that the legitimacy of this
                agreement depends upon the support of a majority of Unionists.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But what about the support of a majority of
                Nationalists? Mr&nbsp;Campbell and other anti-agreement
                Unionists are entirely silent on that matter. Do they accept
                that if there is to be agreement about how this society is run
                that a majority of Nationalists must give their consent? Do they
                even accept that any Nationalist must give his consent? I have
                observed these Colleagues, and it is clear that they do not
                accept this simple principle. Consent, according to some,
                applies only to Unionists; it does not apply to Nationalists at
                all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;McGimpsey was eloquent on the
                question of consent. Consent does not just apply to the question
                of North/South relations; it applies to the question of
                relations within the North, as it does to the whole question of
                relations in any society. No form of government is legitimate
                when it does not have the consent of the majority of its
                citizens, or where significant sections of the community are
                either deliberately, or by whatever means, excluded from the
                business of government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This brings me to the question of
                negotiation, which has arisen during the debate with allegations
                of poor negotiation on the part of one party or another. It
                sometimes seems that articulating one’s demands and then
                handcuffing oneself to them is what negotiation is about. It is
                not. Negotiation involves arguing one’s case and accepting
                that others can argue their case with equal sincerity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Negotiation involves the identification of
                areas of common ground, trying to build on them, trying to find
                ways around areas of disagreement, and finding some way of
                breaking deadlocks over issues that are extremely difficult.
                Ultimately, agreement is always possible if there is all-round
                consent — whether given wholeheartedly or begrudgingly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When Mr&nbsp;Adams and others mentioned
                inward investment and tourism, my view was the same as theirs. I
                would have liked to have seen those matters dealt with by some
                other means — Sean&nbsp;Neeson presented the same view on
                behalf of the Alliance Party. But those were not the only
                matters on the table; a whole range of matters were being
                discussed, and it is axiomatic that no party can get everything
                its own way. Bearing in mind the aims we set out with, we were
                satisfied that the agreement which we have represents the best
                that we could have achieved. We believe that we got a fairly
                good deal, but we did not get all that we wanted. We are not
                vulnerable or liable to criticism for that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mitchel McLaughlin is on altogether weaker
                ground when he accuses the SDLP of a solo run, and of betraying
                the expectations of the Nationalist group. Mr&nbsp;McLaughlin is
                not in a position to lecture the SDLP about the expectations of
                the Nationalist community, because we represent the majority of
                the Nationalist community. And I take exception to the
                allegation that we ignored, or bypassed, or did not seek to
                involve Sinn Fein in the negotiations. No party has made greater
                efforts to help Sinn Fein get into the political process and
                help them adjust to the demands of democracy, and I will not
                listen to criticism in that regard.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I come, finally, to the question of
                decommissioning — a constant refrain of the anti-agreement
                Unionists. My party has been consistent about this from the
                beginning. We took the view that we would not accept any
                precondition — other than peace — for talks, for
                negotiations and for the winning of a peace agreement. We have
                consistently kept to that position. We now take the view that
                there are no preconditions for implementing the agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Decommissioning is part of the agreement and,
                just as there are no preconditions for implementing the
                formation of the Executive or the formation of the North/South
                bodies, we cannot accept that there are any preconditions for
                any part of the agreement — including decommissioning. All
                parts of the agreement must be implemented, and there are no
                preconditions. It is not legitimate for any party to say that it
                will not agree to one part being implemented until all the
                others are. All parts of the agreement must be implemented, and
                we will not accept any other view.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend this report. It has the great
                virtue of identifying a firm date for the determination of these
                matters — 15&nbsp;February — and for movement on to the next
                phase of the agreement.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the risk of being repetitive, the crucial
                element missing from this document is the word
                &quot;decommissioning&quot;. Just as Tony&nbsp;Blair said before
                the 1997 election that the important issues were
                &quot;Education, education, education&quot;, the word that is on
                the lips of every ordinary Unionist out on the street is
                decommissioning. Quite frankly, nothing else counts at the
                moment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have been told that 71% of the people
                voted for this agreement — the number grows every day — and
                the people who voted for this agreement did so on the basis of a
                handwritten promise from Tony&nbsp;Blair. That promise was that
                there would be no question of Sinn Fein/IRA being in the
                Government of this country without decommissioning.</p>
                <i>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ulster Unionist leader reminds me of the
                captain of the Titanic. Heading inexorably towards the iceberg
                — an iceberg called decommissioning — during the talks that
                led to the agreement, he told us that the iceberg was a mirage.
                Before Christmas, we were told that the iceberg was melting
                fast. Now he is telling us that the iceberg is to be moved. But
                in the end the one issue that cannot be fudged, and on which
                there can be no compromise, is the issue of decommissioning. No
                Unionist worth his salt will accept the presence in the
                Government of this country of an armed paramilitary group.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What the First Minister (Designate) and Mr
                Taylor should remember is that militant Republicanism is
                insatiable. It has a two-pronged strategy. A Member for Mid
                Ulster in a previous Assembly, Mr&nbsp;Danny&nbsp;Morrison, used
                to talk about holding an Armalite in one hand and a ballot box
                in the other. The strategy of Sinn Fein/IRA is that, having
                squeezed all the benefit they can out of the Armalite approach,
                and pocketed those gains, they now move on to the ballot box
                strategy, to extract maximum benefit from that. When they have
                achieved maximum benefit from that strategy, then they will move
                back to the Armalite. That is why they need to keep the weapons
                — they are going to use them again.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are thousands of ordinary, decent
                people in the Province who do not wish to accept a return by
                Sinn Fein/IRA to a campaign of murder after they have squeezed
                the maximum concessions out of this process. Let us look at the
                concessions that have already been secured. Two hundred and
                thirty terrorist prisoners have been released; the Patten
                Commission on the future of policing has been set up to
                demoralise the RUC and to make it acceptable to Republicans,
                weakening the force by taking away its weapons and removing all
                the essential elements of the RUC as we know it. These
                concessions have already been made. But, eventually, Sinn
                Fein/IRA will go back to what they know best. They have not gone
                away, you know. They will go back to killing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to remember the consequences of the
                Armalite campaign. As representative for South Down in the
                previous Assembly, between 1982 and 1986, I had the sad duty of
                following the coffins of 13&nbsp;members of the RUC, murdered by
                Sinn&nbsp;Fein/IRA. We should remember the gruesome facts. In
                the case of two of those policemen there was so little of their
                bodies remaining that concrete blocks were put in their coffins
                to convince their widows that they contained the bodies of their
                husbands. But there were no bodies. All that was left of one of
                the policemen could have been put into a plastic carrier bag.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am convinced that there are people in the
                Assembly who know who committed those acts and hundreds of other
                terrorist acts. On many occasions, they may have committed them
                themselves. And yet we are being asked by the First Minister
                (Designate) to accept the people who committed those vile deeds
                into government, without them having given up the rust on the
                barrel of one gun. Our answer to that is &quot;Never&quot;. We
                will never accept that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ervine said that we will lose our salaries
                and our positions as Members. I do not care. The people of South
                Down elected me to this House to oppose this process. If that
                brings the Assembly down, then so be it. We are here to

                how will they deal with important constitutional issues? They
                will say to the other members of the Executive &quot;There are

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They will never say openly &quot;We are going
                to start killing again&quot;, but their subcontractors will. As
                long as they have the Armalites and the Semtex and the rocket
                launchers oiled and ready for action, that threat will remain,
                and that threat will be used. The Member for North Belfast,
                Mr&nbsp;Kelly, tells us that they need these weapons in case a
                riot breaks out in the Ardoyne; the Loyalists and the
                Nationalists are stoning each other, and the Nationalists need
                to be defended. How do you defend the Nationalists of Ardoyne
                with Semtex? The only use for Semtex is to blow up innocent
                civilians and members of the RUC and the Royal Irish Regiment.
                The only reason for retaining Semtex and other vicious weapons
                is to murder people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If Unionists were polled once again as in the
                referendum, there would be a considerable swing against the
                agreement. I have met hundreds of people who voted
                &quot;Yes&quot;, but who now wish they had voted &quot;No&quot;.
                I have met thousands of people who voted &quot;No&quot; and are
                glad they did. There is no defection from the &quot;No&quot;
                campaign to the &quot;Yes&quot; campaign, but there are
                thousands who are defecting from &quot;Yes&quot; to
                &quot;No&quot;. If that agreement were put to the people today,
                the outcome would be very interesting.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I could go into the report in depth, but
                those issues are minor. The only issue is decommissioning, and
                unless that issue is resolved, the ordinary law-abiding people
                of this Province will never accept Sinn Fein/IRA in Government.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat a Chathaoirligh. I wish
                to draw the attention of the Chamber to paragraph&nbsp;3.7 of
                today’s report, which states</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;It is now our clear intention, having
                agreed upon the architecture of Departments, to move with
                urgency in seeking to address the social, economic and cultural
                challenges facing the whole community. We want to agree upon and
                implement a programme for government … We want to address the
                needs of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged; we want to imbue
                the community with a sense of enterprise and self-reliance; we
                want to tackle educational disadvantage …; we want to put
                behind us the tragic years of trauma and separation by providing
                the best possible form and programme of government.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no reason for the Assembly’s not
                moving to do all of these. The problem is the inertia of the
                Ulster Unionist Party. The problem is that Unionism of all
                shades still cannot conceive of dealing with Nationalism on a
                basis of equality. We see this starkly in Portadown, where
                Nationalist residents have been subjected to a seven-month
                campaign of intimidation and threat by the Orange Order. Many
                Members of the Assembly belong to that organisation. There are
                people in this Chamber who have been involved in gatherings in
                Portadown which have gone well beyond the boundaries of
                legitimate protest.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Fein believes that the situation there
                has to be resolved on a basis of equality and respect, and that
                is also how the political process should be driven — on a
                basis of equality and respect. We are here because of our
                electoral mandate, and we are entitled to put forward and debate
                our Republican analysis. The votes of the Sinn Fein electorate
                are as valid as the votes of every other electorate. Our place
                in the Executive comes from that electoral mandate and from the
                Good Friday Agreement, which most of the parties here signed up
                to. Unionism needs to accept that Sinn Fein has a right to be in
                the Executive, and if we are not in the Executive, there will be
                no Executive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, our objective in all of this is to
                advance the peace process. This involves us all, every single
                one of us, in working together, and it involves Unionism
                implementing the agreement. Mr&nbsp;Trimble has now committed
                himself to a definitive report and vote on 15&nbsp;February. On
                that basis I give qualified support to today’s report. Go
                raibh maith agat.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dallat:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the report and I do so for positive
                reasons.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am particularly pleased to see that
                emphasis has been placed on trade and business development
                because that is the way forward. In a global economy where there
                is a marked shift from traditional industries such as textiles
                and engineering to a weightless economy supported and driven by
                knowledge-based companies, it is essential that we do everything
                in our power to ensure that the transition is smooth.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Everyone must benefit from the enormous
                wealth generated by the new industries that have transformed the
                economies of the United States of America and of many other
                parts of the developed world. That can only be done on an
                all-Ireland basis, and for that reason I welcome the proposal to
                set up an implementation body dealing with trade and business
                development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report lays out very clearly the
                practical steps which must be taken to ensure that the Assembly
                delivers on behalf of the people of Northern&nbsp;Ireland. I
                think particularly of those who have no jobs and of those whose
                jobs are threatened by very significant changes taking place in
                the industrial world. Even as we debate this report, American
                companies are packing their bags to come to
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland to seek out business opportunities. Two
                such groups will visit Coleraine in the next few weeks, and they
                are coming because we promised them everything a modern
                progressive company seeking a gateway into Europe wants. They
                are knowledge-based industries that will create secure jobs well
                into the new millennium.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why are they coming? The answer is very
                simple. They are coming because they believe that we have
                settled our political differences by signing the Good Friday
                Agreement. They were influenced by the 11-cities tour by the
                First and Deputy First Ministers (Designate), and they were
                further influenced by a follow-up visit organised by my council
                in Coleraine. I was pleased to be accompanied by my Colleague
                David&nbsp;McClarty.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must also tell the DUP that we were
                accompanied by the DUP Mayor of Coleraine, who enthusiastically
                endorsed the political progress in the North, and we are
                grateful to him for that. I hope that when those American
                visitors come to Coleraine in the next few weeks
                Gregory&nbsp;Campbell and others will turn up and wish the
                visitors &quot;Céad míle fáilte&quot; because there is high
                unemployment in Coleraine, and the people there have a right to
                a future. Certainly, the performance in that corner today gave
                no hope to anyone watching it in the wider world.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Everything that I have said is possible, but
                only if there is political stability, and that will not happen
                if the Assembly does not make progress. The people whom we
                represent are depending on us to deliver, and so far we have not
                done enough.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Lewis Carroll’s classic work ‘Alice’s
                Adventures in Wonderland’ the king calls for the sentence and
                then the verdict. I hope that Members are here to listen to each
                other, and to be persuaded before making up their minds about
                the merits of the report. It confused ordinary people to hear
                political leaders dismissing the report before it was even
                published, never mind debated. I hope that our business is taken
                more seriously than ‘Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland’. We
                are in the real world, and it does not suffer fools gladly or
                condone the type of behaviour that we saw today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The political face of Europe is changing
                rapidly with the enlargement of the European Union. Our status
                as an Objective 1 region is ending. An implementation body to
                deal with special EU programmes is essential if we are to
                continue to benefit from European membership. The border regions
                in particular depend on cross-border initiatives such as
                INTERREG, Leader and other programmes. Those issues can only be
                addressed effectively if we work together.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Department dealing with agriculture and
                rural development is an exciting proposal that will enable us to
                deal with many of the serious issues that affect many of our
                citizens, and particularly those in rural areas. Agriculture is
                in a mess and has been badly handled by direct rule. A Ministry
                to deal specifically with the special needs of farming will
                provide real opportunities for the industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the recognition of the importance
                of rural development because it will not only be the farming
                community which benefits from political progress in that area.
                People who live outside urban areas have particular needs which
                can be addressed through rural development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the last 30&nbsp;years, there have
                been many significant changes in the structure of our rural
                communities. They have suffered badly as a direct result of the
                troubles, and many are in decline. Country schools have closed
                or have been threatened with closure, and a range of community
                structures has disappeared. Even as we speak, plans are being
                set in motion to wipe out the Action for Community Employment
                scheme that had done so much for economic regeneration and
                community support in rural areas. A Department for agriculture
                and rural development is essential if we are to address the
                needs of the people who live in country areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People need skills to avail of new job
                opportunities in a modern world driven by knowledge-based
                industries, and I welcome the plan to separate higher and
                further education and link it to training and employment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the years many people have been
                disadvantaged as a direct result of the troubles. Many have
                missed educational opportunities and women, in particular, have
                been the victims of a society that has not addressed the issue
                of equality in relation to education and training.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Colleges of further education, which were the
                driving force in the past to provide education and training for
                ordinary working people, have been misdirected into a world of
                money-making schemes which have shifted the focus away from the
                people who depend on them most. In the past, the technical
                colleges, as they were known, provided countless opportunities
                for people who had been rejected by the grammar school system.
                Those colleges must be the backbone of a new world of higher and
                further education where the skills they teach are directly
                linked to a new environment, based on information science and
                technology.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many issues in this field were ignored in the
                past, and they can be tackled only if we have the political
                commitment to put our house in order and begin the process of
                providing stable government. We can do that, provided we are not
                like the king in ‘Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland’ who
                demanded the sentence before the verdict.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The honeymoon is over. The work of the
                Assembly must begin in earnest.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The people who elected us are beginning to
                despair. They do not understand why we are holding back, and
                they are worried that the political initiative will revert to
                the lawlessness of the past. No one wants that. It cost too many
                people their lives and their limbs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report is very welcome, but it is
                disappointing that more progress has not been possible. Let us
                renew our efforts to find a way forward which replaces fear by
                trust, hate by love, divisiveness by unity. We have listened to
                the politics of failure for too long. We are sick listening to
                the prophets of doom who have done so much to land us in the
                mess we are in. It is time to move forward and to give our
                people hope for the future and life after the troubles.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the American industrialists and business
                people arrive in Northern Ireland in the next few weeks they
                will undoubtedly ask about political progress. I do not want to
                have to tell them that we have failed — and failed the people
                we represent. I do not want to have to tell them that we had the
                verdict first and then the debate.</p>

                now, and approximately 30&nbsp;Members have spoken. That is a

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The committee which advises you has set aside
                three days for the debate. It was deemed by the committee that,
                unless there was going to be excessive voting, if it was
                possible to close it off by Tuesday night then you would do so.
                Every party left the Committee to Advise the Presiding Officer
                meeting with a clear understanding that they were to organise

                debate in the House of Commons the party leaders are informed of
                the likely times for moving a closure. It seems very strange to

                order, I will take it, although the taking of a point of order

                be greatly resented by the majority of the Unionist community

                Mr&nbsp;Trimble and his Colleagues should think long and hard
                before they agree to this because they will have, at some stage,
                to face the pro-Union electorate.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The word &quot;ambush&quot; rather than
                &quot;guillotine&quot; may be more appropriately used here. It
                is my experience, limited though that may be, that such events
                are often the source of some displeasure to those who find
                themselves on the wrong side of the ambush. The Standing Orders
                present me with a dilemma. Some Members still clearly wish to
                speak, and they understood that there would be an opportunity
                for them to speak when they came here — that is clear.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the other hand, the Standing Orders are
                also clear: if there is a reason to believe that parties who are
                present have had a reasonable opportunity to put forward their
                views, a Member who has not spoken has a right to move that the
                Question be put. Then it is for the Assembly to decide. The only
                decision that I am permitted to make — and it is a decision
                that I am required to make — is on whether to put the Question
                that the Question be put to the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this context I have no alternative but to
                put the matter to the Assembly. Let me be clear so there is no
                misunderstanding: if the Question that the Question be put is
                carried by the Assembly, and it will just need a simple majority
                to carry it, then we move immediately to a vote on the amendment
                — if Dr&nbsp;Paisley wishes to move it — and then to a vote
                on the substantive motion, if the amendment is not carried. I
                will deal with the matter of the substantive motion when we get
                to it, but there will be no further debate. Is that understood?</p>

                far exceed your authority if you say that you can lock doors
                when there is nothing in the Standing Orders about that. We are
                going by Standing Orders which we did not draw up — the
                Secretary of State drew them up — and they do not say that the
                doors should be locked. I came when the vote was about to take
                place, and I was told I could not get in.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There were two men at the door saying to a
                Member that he could not get in. You know very well that in the
                House of Commons any Member can go in to vote at any time if he
                is going through the House and through the Lobby doors. Those

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me say a number of things. First of all,
                I cannot pronounce about the House of Commons, but I am
                certainly aware that in the House of Lords the doors are locked.

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am quite aware from the tenor of the
                discourse that this is not the House of Lords.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of your colleagues asked about the length
                of time allowed in the House of Commons. Eight minutes is, of
                course, correct. The time given to reach the Chamber here is
                very short — it is much longer in other places.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have drawn this matter to the attention of
                the Standing Orders Committee because we would be very
                ill-advised to draw up our own Standing Orders yet keep the time
                so short that it was difficult for Members to get from all parts
                of the building.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have been asked whether I have the

                extend my own authority, but 2(1) Standing Order states</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is necessary to fasten the doors because
                we do not have a Division Lobby procedure where Members can go
                through and out. The exercise should not surprise Members
                because it was followed at previous sittings.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have said that I will make enquiries about
                the matter. I am sorry that Members feel that they have been
                caught out, but the procedure seems to be an appropriate way to
                work. If the Standing Orders Committee takes the view that this
                is not the way that it wishes to conduct matters, I will be glad
                to hear about that.</p>

                to Dr&nbsp;Paisley refers to your ruling on questions arising
                from the Standing Orders. You therefore have to make rulings on
                the basis of these Standing Orders. Which Standing Order
                suggests that doors can or should be locked at any time? You
                must rule on the basis of the Standing Orders and nothing else.</p>

                it was never disputed by any Member of the Assembly, that the
                Initial Standing Orders were inadequate. I further indicated
                that I would base rulings thereafter on my understanding of the
                Initial Standing Orders, the draft Standing Orders put forward
                by the Standing Orders Committee and Erskine&nbsp;May.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was never any dispute about my being
                able to use other than the Initial Standing Orders. Indeed,
                several Members from a number of parties have discussed the
                matter of how Erskine&nbsp;May might be applied. I am not
                restricted to these Standing Orders as they are inadequate for
                this task. If there is a problem about making fast the doors —
                and I have yet to hear what the problem is — I will be happy
                to hear about it from Members and to look at the question again.
                These Standing Orders are not adequate for the running of the
                Chamber. That is why I have indicated that I will refer to other
                matters as well. There has been no objection until now.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have undertaken to enquire into the point
                of order that was raised by Mr&nbsp;O’Connor. It seems to me
                that that legitimately extends to a number of issues, some of
                which Mr&nbsp;Robinson, the Member for East Belfast, has
                referred to. Questions such as whether Members are inside the
                confines of the Chamber when they are in the voting Lobby will
                have to be determined. However, I remind Members that the
                Lobbies are not presently in use because there is no option to
                use them under the Standing Orders. The new draft Standing
                Orders indicate that that may be a possibility.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are further questions as to whether,
                for example, a Member who was in the Gallery would be in the
                confines of the House. Those are legitimate questions, and, as I
                have agreed to explore that matter, it will have to be looked at
                as well.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There seems to be an extraordinary eagerness
                to make points of order. <i>[Interruption]</i> I have not
                completed what I have to say, and until I sit down it is clearly
                out of order for other Members to stand.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the further question asked by the Member,
                I cannot give him a ruling on the first matter, but I have given
                a fairly clear ruling on the other matters. Regarding the timing
                for making fast the doors, the clock will have shown that, three
                minutes from the time when the matter was raised, I called for
                the doors to be made fast. We then proceeded to take a vote. I
                trust that is clear.</p>

                for debate, only for it to be overturned today.</p>

                Mr&nbsp;McCartney a chance to speak, but I suspect that he can
                probably speak for himself on these matters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the other questions you raised
                about the discussions of the Committee to Advise the Presiding
                Officer, you will be aware that it is not always possible to
                reach full agreement — for instance, even the recognition of
                parties is not something that comes with unanimous agreement,
                but one has to do one’s best.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before I take the next point of order from
                the DUP, I would remind Members that we have an Adjournment
                debate scheduled with six Members who are prepared to speak. It
                would be most inappropriate to call them back tomorrow should it
                be clear that we are going to move on to further votes. I
                propose at this stage, unless the points of order last for an
                extraordinary length of time, to complete the business this

                this: we have been in debate for around five hours, over 30
                Members have now spoken, and all parties in the Assembly have

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further to that point of order and to the
                ruling that you have given, Mr Presiding Officer, I would like
                you to amplify it so that we know exactly what is happening. I
                have been a Member of the House of Commons for 30&nbsp;years,
                and I have heard Members attacking the Clerks of the House about
                whether notices have been put in at the correct time. I want to
                know whether our Clerks are going to be under the same
                regulations as the Clerks in the Mother of Parliaments, or are
                we not allowed to mention their names? In the Commons the Clerks
                are servants of the House, and any Member can raise publicly
                matters that are relevant to them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I believe that your ruling comes from the
                custom in the House of Commons that Members do not attack civil
                servants since they merely do the work of their masters who are
                essentially those in Government. That, however, does not extend
                to the Clerks of the House. They are the servants of the House,
                and when their work does not please a Member, that Member has
                the right to raise the matter publicly and criticise what they
                have done.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney made a statement about the
                Deputy Clerk, and he is responsible for that statement. But the
                general issue is a very serious one. Is this House to have
                Clerks who can do as they like without fear of public criticism
                from Members?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member is well aware that that is not
                what I am saying. I am not suggesting that anyone in this House
                is beyond reproach. What I am saying is that there are
                appropriate ways of doing these things. You must understand that
                I feel a responsibility, not only to the Assembly, its Chamber,
                proceedings and Standing Orders, but to the staff as well.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All sorts of questions may be raised,
                especially in the later part of the day when points of order are
                raised in this way. But when something is bounced in respect of
                the Deputy Clerk, I am sure you will understand that I am
                fearful of officials being dragged into what is essentially a
                political dispute among the parties. Even in other places, there
                exists a general feeling that for officials, including the
                Speaker, to be dragged into party political debates is improper.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have a point of order which relates to the
                statement that you have just made. I accept that you have to
                make a ruling and that, unless there is an exceptional
                circumstance, such as I believe occurred here, no criticism
                should be made of an official.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was open to you, Mr Initial Presiding
                Officer, to issue a warning that if there came a point at which
                you were happy that all sides had had sufficient opportunity to
                argue their case, and you were asked by a Member who had not
                previously spoken to put the Question, the Question could be
                put.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, by way of indirect apology, if that
                is what is required, I would have to say that I approached the
                Clerk and told him that I had a pressing engagement which might
                take me away from the House for an hour. I asked for some
                indication of the likelihood of a vote. I treated the official
                with proper respect. He is a servant of the Assembly, and I, as
                a Member, am entitled to ask him for advice on matters which are
                within his area of responsibility.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The point that I am making is that the Clerk
                told me that, despite the fact that there were 12 or
                14&nbsp;Members still listed to speak in the debate, it might
                not be opportune to leave the House even for such a short
                period, and that he would advise me further as to the reasons
                for this. All of this would appear to suggest that the Clerk was
                aware that, despite the fact that there were 14 Members still
                waiting to speak, some kind of guillotine was about to be
                imposed. In those circumstances, Mr Initial Presiding Officer,
                you have a duty to inform Members that this kind of thing is
                about to happen and that Members would be well advised to stay
                in the House.</p>

                caution. I am not accusing the Clerk of anything — he works
                under your direction — but some Members feel that the Chair
                was aware of the intention on the part of the proposer of the
                motion to close the debate. As Initial Presiding Officer, you
                determined that there would be a two-day debate, with a third
                day if a vote was required. When you did that, you did it in the
                full knowledge of the number of speeches that could be made in
                the course of two days’ debate. It cannot, therefore, be said
                that the number of speakers who have taken part in the debate
                today was reasonable when it had previously been judged that
                there should be two days of debate on the matter. I ask this
                because it is not covered by any specific Standing Order, but
                you will accept the suggestion that it should be covered by
                Standing Orders.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of us feel that, if any circumstances
                merit a motion of no confidence in the Initial Presiding
                Officer, these do. I want a ruling from you as to how such a
                motion might be put forward.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You will recall that when the question of the
                number of days was raised, the matter of the time to be allowed
                for each speaker had not been resolved. You shake your head, but
                that is a fact. Matters did not turn out in the way that a
                number of Members felt was appropriate. The question is not
                whether I want the debate to last two days; it is what does the
                Assembly want. Does the questioner have the right to put forward
                the question? Does he have the right to seek the views of the
                Assembly? Those are the questions I must answer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I made the judgement that the Assembly had
                the right to govern itself in this matter. I may have been
                wrong, but 75 Members seem to have believed that that was
                correct, although 24 Members wished to take things further.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is not the position.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If I ask for the views of the Assembly and
                the Assembly votes 75 to 24, then it seems to me that that is
                the appropriate action to take. I understand the unhappiness of
                some Members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the final part of your
                question, my understanding is that the procedure for putting
                down a vote of no confidence in the Presiding Officer is to put
                it down as a motion, and I think that is the sort of motion that
                would need to be considered at the next Assembly meeting. I am
                making that ruling without there being a relevant Standing
                Order; it seems to me that it is a matter of such gravity that
                it could not be dealt with in any other way. It would not be
                possible for a Presiding Officer to continue if there were a
                feeling that he had acted in bad faith.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As to what the Presiding Officer knows or
                does not know, surmises or does not surmise, if it is seriously
                thought that someone can do this job and serve all the differing
                enterprises and initiatives in this Assembly without being
                prepared to keep matters to himself — or herself, in the case
                of a Madam Speaker — then there is not much understanding of
                what needs to be done. I try to ensure that Members who approach
                me are as well informed as possible, and some Members, both
                individually and as parties, take full advantage of that between
                sittings. If there is not sufficient confidence in me, it would
                be quite right to put down such a motion and to find an
                alternative who would enjoy that confidence. If the Member
                wishes to discuss the matter with me afterwards, I shall ensure
                that I am available.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The point that Mr Robinson has already made
                is that everyone in this Assembly was aware that this debate was
                scheduled to last two days. At some time today, Mr Presiding
                Officer, you became aware that it might be terminated well short
                of that. As Presiding Officer, you have to make a judgement that
                is fair to everyone, but you must have been aware that many
                Members were making inquiries so as to ensure that they would be
                present for any vote.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It appears that you must have known that a
                motion of this kind might be made. Consequently, in justice to
                all Members and to ensure that there was no misapprehension or
                unfairness or use of some procedural technique to secure unfair
                advantage, it was your duty not to babysit Members but to alert
                them to something that they would not otherwise have been aware
                of.</p>
                <i>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member, of all the Members here, must
                know that over the last number of weeks I have been made aware
                of all sorts of possible developments and changes, and I have
                treated them in a professional way. I have not broken confidence
                of any kind. I have done that all through the time here, and for
                whatever short period I continue, I will continue to do that.
                However, I fear that what is happening is that Members are
                mistaking their political disgruntlement for something else
                completely.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have taken an extensive number of points
                of order. We are in danger of breaching the Standing Orders,
                which indicate that this matter is not a matter for debate.
                While many of these may indeed be legitimate and understandable
                points of order, it is beginning to become a debate on the
                issue. That takes us well outside Standing Orders. I was going
                to say that I do not think there is any Member asking to give a
                point of order who has not already given one, but I see
                Mr&nbsp;Sammy&nbsp;Wilson rising to his feet.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is extending well beyond the question
                about points of order. I am prepared to take only two further
                points of order. The two Members who got to their feet at the
                same time as myself are both out of order. I will, nevertheless,
                take them as points of order. First of all, Mr Wilson.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr S Wilson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With respect, Mr Initial Presiding Officer,
                first of all, I do not think you can anticipate what I was going
                to say. You may have anticipated, because you had prior
                knowledge, what was going to happen at the end of the
                proceedings today, but you certainly cannot anticipate the point
                of order which I was going to make, whether it was a new point
                of order or a follow-on from some of the other ones.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In light of your ruling today and the
                consequences of that, I would like some guidance from you on the
                Initial Standing Orders. Under Item 6, the Business of the
                Assembly, it states that you, the Presiding Officer, will,
                subject to the provisions of paragraph 5, publish the business
                for each day.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Furthermore, under 6(3) you should prepare at
                least twice weekly when the Assembly is sitting and at least
                fortnightly when in recess a paper listing notices of future
                business received. I would like some guidance as to whether or
                not such a document is for the guidance of people like myself
                and other Members as to when we will be required to attend and
                when a vote is likely to be taken. That is my understanding of
                the notice which I am given.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If that is not the case — <i>[Interruption]</i>
                It is a point of order.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understood that the business which we
                started today would be carried on tomorrow with a vote being
                taken either tomorrow or on Wednesday. Other Members, who are
                not here, worked on that basis. In the light of your decision,
                may I ask whether the papers we get from you represent an
                aspiration, a fact or a fairy tale which can be altered on a
                whim? We have heard frequent references — I have counted three
                — from Members of the Ulster Unionist Party who talk about the
                fact that they and the SDLP are working this Assembly.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is clear that a considerable number of

                practice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First of all, the paper which comes out twice
                per week giving forthcoming business is not an Order Paper.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second paper the Member referred to is
                not designed to let people know when votes may or may not be
                taken; it merely gives guidance on what is coming up.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The paper that the Member is looking for
                should be coming from the party Whip. It will tell him the
                times, the likely votes, the members of his party who should be
                speaking and leading in debates, and when there will be a one-,
                two- or three-line Whip and will alert him to situations where
                either his party or another one may try to ambush. That is the
                business of a Whip; that is his responsibility. Even though it
                is not my responsibility, I have tried to advise the party Whips
                on these matters, and some of them are trying valiantly to
                ensure that they attend to everybody’s needs. However, the
                matters the Member refers to are not relevant to the Business
                Office.</p>

                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When Lord&nbsp;Dubs launched the document ‘Shaping
                Our Future’ on Tuesday 8&nbsp;December last it was welcomed
                across the board by all those who spoke at the event.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I too wish to be associated with the general
                acceptance of the draft proposals, particularly the positive
                references to the plans for the A1 Dublin/Belfast road, and to
                recognise that, at last, the strategic importance of Newry has
                been accepted — it is to become one of the seven major service
                centres. I also welcome the importance attached to Warrenpoint,
                and the proposal that its harbour plays a key role in the future
                economics of the eastern seaboard.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, as a representative for the area
                that includes the Mournes — an area of natural beauty — and
                the green belt around Newry and Warrenpoint, I am disappointed
                that no attempt was made to reverse the never-ending planning
                problems caused in those areas by the 1993 document ‘A
                Planning Strategy for Rural Northern Ireland’. Indeed, if
                accepted in its entirety, the ‘Shaping Our Future’ document
                will exacerbate for the foreseeable future the problems
                contained in its forerunner.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This major concern prompts me to highlight
                the problems that exist throughout the Mournes, in rural areas
                of south Down and, indeed, in a number of other rural regions
                represented in this Assembly. I refer to the forced migration
                that is currently being imposed upon large sections of the rural
                community as a result of legislation contained in the 1993 rural
                strategy document.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Also, many of the paragraphs explaining the
                document’s purpose are contradicted elsewhere in the same
                document — often in the administration of the strategy. For
                example — and here I am being selective — I quote from the
                1993 rural strategy document a number of lines which outline its
                objectives:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;to meet the future development needs of
                the rural community&quot; [p&nbsp;20];</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;to facilitate regeneration of the rural
                economy&quot; [p 20];</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the Strategy is an attempt to meet
                rural society’s development needs and aspirations&quot; [p
                20];</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Regeneration activities in settlements
                in the most disadvantaged rural areas will be co-ordinated,
                where possible, with the actions of the Department of
                Agriculture, to achieve maximum benefit from the settlement and
                its rural hinterland&quot; [p 25].</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The dwelling house must</p>
                <blockquote>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">c. be in the ownership of the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, this chapter has a sting in the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;be occupied or capable of occupation
                with minor renovation&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This clause has been used time and again by
                planning officers at site meetings, as they explain that the
                refusals are in keeping with the policy outlined in this section
                of the planning strategy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An examination of the number of recommended
                refusals is a good indication of the problems created by the
                document. For example, in the area south of a line drawn between
                Newtownhamilton and Downpatrick, in Newry and Mourne District
                Council, and in large sections of the Banbridge and Down
                District Council areas, there have been approximately 1250
                recommended refusals during the 20&nbsp;months of the current
                local government term. Of these refusals, 610 relate to the
                Newry and Mourne area alone, and a very high percentage of those
                relate to rural applications. No doubt, Members from other rural
                constituencies will produce figures for their areas if the
                matter is ever debated in the House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The document prohibits some owners of
                smallholdings from giving a son or daughter a little garden or
                corner of a field that would suit perfectly and could be
                utilised as a building site.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not seek the transformation of prime
                agricultural land or heather-clad hillsides into an urban
                sprawl. And I know that the vast majority of the applicants that
                I refer to would have no difficulty in accepting environmentally
                friendly conditions, such as restriction on size and design,
                seclusion or external decor that the planners often place — as
                they should — on approved applications.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The present planning legislation has many
                wider implications, none greater than the closure of country
                schools due to lack of numbers. These numbers could be
                maintained were planning approvals to be granted in the
                catchment area of these long-established and greatly acclaimed
                rural seats of learning. I am aware of a number of primary
                schools that were forced to close their doors in recent years,
                mainly through lack of numbers. What kind of policy is it that
                claims to be concerned with our heritage but which
                simultaneously leads directly to the closure of rural schools?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The current legislation compels many young
                people to live away from home, relations and friends. Not all
                young people want to live in the countryside, but I am concerned
                about those applicants who are prevented from so doing by an
                unsympathetic policy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Forced migration from rural areas has reached
                an unacceptable level in many parts and must be urgently
                addressed. I look forward to the day when planning, and in
                particular rural planning, becomes the responsibility of those
                who know the area and understand the needs of the local people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many Members have used a song or poem to
                illustrate their point. Not wishing to be different, I will
                quote a line from an old Irish song, ‘Galway Bay’:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the strangers came and tried to teach
                us their way.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I often wonder what understanding or real
                interest strangers such as the Tory Ministers who ruled us for
                so long and devised and endorsed such documents had in the
                well-being of the farmers and their families living on 40- to
                50-acre, less-favoured holdings. I doubt whether the landed
                gentry, who came from four or five thousand-acre farms, could
                relate to the needs of the small farmer here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Out of curiosity, I checked the interests of
                the Minister of Environment who signed the Rural Planning
                Strategy for Northern Ireland document in 1993. I learned that
                this very honourable and likeable man, whom I had the pleasure
                of knowing, was interested in wine, cricket and
                Sherlock&nbsp;Holmes. This illustrates my point and questions
                the ability of previous Ministers to understand the needs of
                those who work the fields and hills of the Mournes, the Sperrins
                or elsewhere in this part of Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is considerable sensible thinking in
                the document about our landscapes and heritage which the ‘Shaping
                Our Future’ document develops, and many chapters cannot be
                challenged. However, both publications lost their way somewhat
                by overlooking the needs of such an important section of
                society, with the emphasis on policies rather than the needs of
                the indigenous rural people.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">7.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I make a special appeal to rural communities
                to challenge, where necessary, the shortcomings in any future
                documents. The onus is not only on politicians but on every
                committee and representative body in the affected areas to
                respond to the Minister’s draft proposal before
                15&nbsp;February&nbsp;1999, and support the aspirations of their
                children and their neighbours’ children to live, if they
                desire, in areas that are their birthright.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the view of the Construction
                Employers’ Federation that a February deadline provides too
                short a period for serious consideration to be given to
                submissions. I request Lord&nbsp;Dubs to stall any final
                decision on the strategy until the matter is fully discussed in
                the Assembly. It makes sense for the strategy for the future to
                be discussed and agreed by the elected representatives in the
                Assembly if devolved government becomes a reality.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I conclude by addressing those Members who, I
                hope, will one day plan what is best for rural
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland. They must commence their deliberations on
                what they believe to be best for the long established rural
                dwellers and their offspring. If that matter is addressed in a
                sympathetic, fair and proper manner, forced migration will be
                brought to an end. Those of us who represent rural areas which
                include green belts and areas of outstanding natural beauty know
                that that day cannot come soon enough.</p>

                people who have distinguished themselves in the sporting world,
                and they are all from Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Despite having a population of only
                1·5&nbsp;million, Northern&nbsp;Ireland has produced an
                enviable and impressive list of world-class sportsmen and
                sportswomen over the years. In spite of often difficult and
                turbulent circumstances, sport attracts much genuine local
                interest and enthusiasm. For participants and spectators it can
                be part of an enjoyable normality that is a welcome relief from
                the troubles in our community. It would be naive to suggest that
                sport in Northern Ireland has escaped the divisions which
                permeate our cultural, civic and socio-economic life. Sport in
                itself is neutral, but in our case it also reflects the society
                in which it is played.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland has two distinct and, some
                would say, diametrically opposed cultural communities. Some
                sports, such as rugby and Gaelic football, are symbols of the
                two cultural traditions. They are learned at an early age within
                a largely segregated education system. Sports which do not have
                such a symbolic link can have such links attached to them by
                where they are played, who watches them and who organises them.
                These symbolic roles are reinforced by the flags that are flown,
                the emblems which are used and the anthems which are played.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sport should bring people together,
                regardless of religious background or political persuasion. It
                is often a means of building solid community relations. I am
                sorry that Sinn Fein Members are not present because I think
                that that is why Sinn Fein opposed Donegal Celtic’s fixture
                with the RUC. They opposed the match despite the fact that only
                four members of the RUC were in the team. Sinn Fein were
                petrified of the consequences of improved community relations.
                Although the Donegal Celtic story is old news, it serves as a
                valuable lesson on what could have been a wonderful opportunity
                to promote sport as an agent of reconciliation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The way forward is for sports clubs and
                associations to recruit from both sides of the community. In
                sports where one section is under- represented, they could
                specifically target local schools. Sports can also attempt to be
                impartial by ensuring that administrators and coaches represent
                both communities and, where possible, ensuring competition in
                venues that are acceptable to both communities. A number of
                initiatives are attempting to build sporting bridges across the
                community divide. We are entering a new era in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland which will require a dramatic shift in how
                we think and act.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I urge Members to think seriously about the
                enormous benefits of cross-community sporting initiatives.
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland has produced a wealth of sporting talent
                in the past, and we now have an opportunity to tap into a well
                of talent and promote community reconciliation in the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An inaugural meeting between the Sports
                Council for Northern&nbsp;Ireland and Members of Parliament was
                held on 27&nbsp;January 1998 in the House of Commons. Two of the
                points that I have picked up relate to social benefits.
                According to a survey, eight out of 10 people from all social
                and religious backgrounds believe that sport can help to build
                lasting relationships among people from different religions and
                social backgrounds. Surveys have also shown that for eight out
                of 10 people in Northern&nbsp;Ireland, sport has managed, in the
                face of political instability, prejudice, and intolerance, to be
                a positive social force.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In recent years, the serious problems of drug
                misuse and related crime have increased throughout Northern
                Ireland. Drug misuse has probably affected every area in the
                North, but in recent months it has eaten into the very fabric of
                social life in South Antrim. I acknowledge the contribution that
                was made on this topic at a previous sitting by one of my fellow
                South Antrim Assembly Members, Mr&nbsp;Boyd, and I look forward
                to discussing this issue with him. I hope to return to that
                during the debate. I am sure that all Members will agree that
                the drugs problem unites all sections of our society,
                irrespective of political views.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last November, a European-wide drug
                prevention week was launched, at the same time as phase&nbsp;3
                of a public information campaign on drugs by the Health
                Promotion Agency. The Assembly must send a clear message to the
                people of Northern&nbsp;Ireland that we will address this issue
                with determination and commitment. We have all been returned to
                the Assembly to give leadership to our community. Let us make
                clear our intentions on one of the most pressing social problems
                facing our people, whether they live in Belfast, Ballymena,
                Derry or Armagh.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Every other week, we hear about seizures of
                drugs and about convictions for possession or intent to supply.
                Only last October, drugs worth £250,000 were seized in the port
                of Belfast.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In many of the housing estates in our towns
                and villages, drug pushing is increasing. Frequently — in
                Antrim housing estates in particular — it is carried out in
                the open, in full view of the general public and often with
                children playing nearby. Communities are being slowly destroyed
                as drugs poison their areas. Crime is rising throughout the
                North. A recent report suggests that perhaps 60% of crime could
                be related either directly or indirectly to drugs. Many people
                in my area have told me that they are intimidated by gangs who
                run around housing estates to and from houses where non-stop
                drugs parties are held and drugs of all sorts are openly
                available.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Local drug barons are continually looking for
                new customers. They exploit the young, who are at a vulnerable
                and critical period in their lives, and introduce them to a
                drugs culture which creates additional social and emotional
                difficulties. Unfortunately, some of them are led into crime to
                feed their habit, and a vicious cycle is created.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly will soon have responsibility
                for many of the social and community aspects of life here, and
                should be able to determine how resources can best be deployed
                in a campaign against drugs.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I believe that a drugs task force should be
                set up, with the support of local communities and statutory and
                voluntary bodies. It could be under the authority of the
                Assembly and could liaise with the proposed Civic Forum. This
                body could also take on responsibility for initiatives relating
                to health promotion and drug awareness.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I acknowledge the efforts of the various
                agencies involved in work with drugs. Local drugs co-ordination
                teams have been taking forward programmes specifically tailored
                to local needs in each of the four health board areas, and I
                acknowledge in particular, the good work being done in my local
                board area by the team based in Ballymena, where, according to
                recent RUC figures, there are approximately 200&nbsp;people
                using heroin on a regular basis. These figures are shocking.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As we move towards devolution, the Assembly
                will need to consider the implementation of anti-drugs
                initiatives. At present, local drugs co-ordination teams are
                accountable to the Northern Ireland Office whose policy is
                directed by the Central Co-Ordinating Group for Action Against
                Drugs, chaired by the Minister of State,
                Mr&nbsp;Adam&nbsp;Ingram. Currently, responsibility for some
                areas of drugs policy is reserved to Westminster, but, if we are
                to tackle our local drugs problem effectively, we will need to
                consider what role the Assembly can play in order to resolve it.
                As the elected representatives of the people of Northern
                Ireland, we will, at some stage, have to play a role in
                confronting and combating drug abuse.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the document ‘Notes on the Clauses of
                the Northern Ireland Bill’, the section relating to clause 4

                resolution requesting the change.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At some stage in the future, when sufficient
                confidence in the Assembly has been built up, we will want to
                see local politicians taking responsibility for the
                co-ordination of local drug strategies. I firmly believe that we
                can beat the drugs problem, but we must be focused and realistic
                in our approach. We should put in place an innovative and
                properly resourced mechanism to curb and, in the longer term,
                fully eliminate the drugs problem. It is important that any such
                mechanisms draw support from all democratic parties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Quick-fix actions which bring people out on
                to the streets in a kind of vigilante-style response are not the
                answer. This approach only arouses emotions and adds to the
                overall problem, and represents only a short-term response
                driven by populist elements within particular political
                groupings. Past experience has shown that heavy prison sentences
                and even paramilitary beatings have not deterred the drug barons
                and the dealers. What we need to do now is to build and
                implement a structured and realistic community response, and
                Members of the Assembly should take the lead in this.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At present, Government planning bodies do not
                appear to give any priority to the needs of the Mid Ulster area,
                in respect of commerce and tourism.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The M1 leads from Belfast to Dungannon just
                south of Lough Neagh; to the north of the Lough the M2 leaves
                Belfast and stops short of Toomebridge. The Glenshane Pass
                continues to Londonderry and the A26 connects the M2 to
                Ballymena and the north coast. To the west, the A5 connects
                Omagh and Londonderry. Where does Mid Ulster fit into this
                equation?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mid Ulster has been socially and economically
                neglected over the years. It seems to be considered unimportant
                when it comes to health, tourism, industry, roads and rural
                development. The announcement of an £87 million investment in
                Northern Ireland’s roads is certainly welcome, but Mid Ulster
                has been overlooked. The roads that are being developed surround
                Mid Ulster, but none run through the area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are more than 28,000 permanent
                dwellings in Mid Ulster, of which 62% are owner-occupied, 5% are
                privately rented and 30% are rented from public authority. Two
                per cent are rented from housing associations or charitable
                trusts. Unemployment in the area runs at about 18%. There is a
                higher than average number of self-employed people with no
                employees, presumably small farmers. Traffic counts on various
                roads vary from 10,000 to 4,500 vehicles per day.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The A29, which runs from Coleraine to Armagh
                directly through Mid Ulster, should be examined and developed.
                If the A29 were improved, the majority of traffic in the area
                would use it and contributory roads would be less abused. Cash
                spent on the A29 would be cash saved on the minor roads.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I call for an investigation into development
                of the hard shoulder along the A29 to facilitate agricultural
                and other slow-moving vehicles. Policy should reflect the fact
                that this is a rural area, while also taking into consideration
                the commercial and domestic vehicles using the road. I recognise
                that the hard shoulders were not designed for any volume of fast
                or heavy traffic, but the width of the road is there and could
                be better utilised to reduce congestion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Slow-moving lorries and agricultural vehicles
                could pull in to a reconstructed secondary lane, as is
                effectively done in other countries. Road junctions could be set
                back and the new slow lane used as a slipway before joining or
                leaving the main line of traffic. On the A29 as a whole, some
                sections are already suitable for heavy, fast-moving traffic,
                while others need further investment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The present bottlenecks at King’s&nbsp;Bridge,
                Cookstown and Carland&nbsp;Bridge near Dungannon need to be
                removed and priority must be given to the construction of
                bypasses to avoid the town centres of Cookstown and Dungannon.
                &quot;Park-and-Ride&quot; services could also be provided for
                the major towns in this area. This would ease congestion at peak
                times as well as reducing air pollution in the town centres.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the A29 were further developed, vehicles
                travelling from north to south across the Province would have a
                choice of routes. Traffic across Northern Ireland would be more
                evenly balanced. For instance, someone travelling from Counties
                Down or Armagh to Londonderry or the north coast could travel
                through Mid Ulster instead of travelling east of Lough Neagh.
                This would also ease congestion at Toomebridge.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mid Ulster is ideally situated for businesses
                targeting the whole of Northern Ireland. Of the top 1,000
                businesses in Northern Ireland 54 are located in Mid Ulster, and
                10% of these are situated along the A29. If Mid Ulster were more
                accessible, industry would be more likely to set up in the
                region, thus producing more jobs and encouraging people to live
                in Mid Ulster, as opposed to the cities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unemployment in Mid Ulster is significantly
                higher than the Northern Ireland average, and there is a higher
                proportion of self-employed men and women. This reflects the
                large number of farmers in the area. Due to the present
                depression in agriculture, farming is no longer providing
                sufficient income for a satisfactory standard of living. An
                increase in local industry would enable the farmer to travel to
                work more easily while also managing his farm. With an increase
                in industry in Mid Ulster, local people would have a greater
                chance of obtaining local jobs, and that might result in a
                reduction in the congestion on the two motorways that head
                towards Belfast. If jobs were within reasonable distance from
                home, people could stay in Mid Ulster. The area would still be
                populated and the possibility of attracting tourists would not
                diminish.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have to make Mid Ulster more accessible,
                and we must promote awareness of the beauty of the Sperrins and
                Mid Ulster area in general. It has also been brought to my
                notice that five regional tourist organisations have been
                established in Northern Ireland, yet the Sperrin area seems to
                have been forgotten again. Mid Ulster has been recognised as an
                area of outstanding beauty and an area of scientific as well as
                historic interest. Mid Ulster provides some of the most varied
                fishing opportunities in Europe — and that could be developed
                more. There are also numerous golfing venues and a great variety
                of outdoor pursuits and indoor leisure facilities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope to see a transformation from the
                confrontational attitude of those who adopt a &quot;dog in the
                manger&quot; approach to our traditional parades to one which is
                more tolerant. The minority culture in the Mid Ulster area must
                also be protected — some facets of that are only to be seen in
                rural areas. There must be provision for cultural expression in
                towns and villages. What a spectacle our respective bands and
                traditions could provide for visitors from abroad! Mid Ulster
                has remarkable possibilities for attracting tourism and greater
                promotion of those possibilities could create more jobs which
                are much needed in this area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The health of our people is very important.
                Over 100,000&nbsp;people are served by the Mid-Ulster and South
                Tyrone hospitals. If the roads are not of the highest standard,
                hospitals are not easily accessible. In the near future, if one
                hospital is to be built to replace the two existing ones, it
                would be necessary for it to be easily accessible by road.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, Mid Ulster is at the heart of
                our Province, and like every other heart the arteries leading to
                it must be free-flowing and of good quality to keep it alive and
                pumping. The infrastructure of the Mid Ulster area must be
                further developed, and we must provide opportunities for an
                increase in business and tourism. Mid Ulster is appreciated by
                people from all over the world. It must be promoted so that the
                people of the area can find jobs locally, and it must be seen to
                be an area of great potential so that it can really become the
                centre of Ulster.</p>

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I nearly voted along with the DUP tonight! I
                was told last week that I would be speaking on Wednesday. At
                lunchtime today I was told that I would be speaking tomorrow
                night, and two hours ago I was told that I would be speaking
                tonight. I am not criticising my Chief Whip, but I will raise
                the matter at our next meeting.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to deal with housing. We have an
                opportunity to give renewed priority to housing. Priority status
                was taken from the Housing Executive in 1992-93, and every year
                since then its budget has been cut. That includes this year, as
                we heard when the Minister made his presentation to the
                Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to refer mainly to the Foyle area, to
                highlight some of the problems that we have faced because of
                these cut-backs. There is a waiting list of 1400, and that
                waiting list has not gone down during the last 10 to 15 years.
                There are 411 on the A1 list — that is the emergency list for
                homelessness — and there are a number of A2s and priority
                transfers. A homeless, one-parent family would have to wait up
                to 18 months before being housed. It would be offered temporary
                accommodation, if available — and usually it is not. That
                one-parent family will remain homeless.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A young married couple, with no priority
                status, would be advised to come back in five years. Even then,
                given the amount of priority transfers and A1 cases, their
                position may be the same. We need a new Bill to reduce the
                waiting list of 1400 and to cater for the homeless figure of
                411, which continues to rise daily.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since the cuts, we have been campaigning for
                a number of areas to be refurbished — there is one in the
                Bogside that we have been campaigning for for 15&nbsp;years.
                Over the last five years the Housing Executive has told
                councillors and tenant associations that it was on the list to
                be done the following year. It continues to be put back.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is one example, and there are others in
                the Derry area. I stress this one because the area has been
                described by the Housing Executive as having the worst housing
                conditions in Northern Ireland with no central heating and flat
                roofs which cause constant dampness. We have been promised that
                refurbishment will be carried out this year. The Housing
                Executive has now learnt to say &quot;subject to finance being
                available&quot; when it tells councillors and tenant
                associations who in turn tell the tenants. You can understand
                the residents’ position.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Housing Executive has admitted that no
                one else would live in the houses in that area because their
                conditions are so poor. The people who live in them do so
                because they are close to the city centre and they have been
                promised refurbishing, year in, year out. This situation cannot
                go on.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Adaptations in the Foyle area take up to a
                year after application. An adaptation is for someone who is
                disabled and needs a downstairs toilet, a downstairs shower or
                an extension for a bedroom downstairs. Unfortunately, some
                people never live to see the adaptations completed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The grants section of the Housing Executive
                deals with new roofs, new windows and rewiring. Another member
                of the Housing Executive in the Foyle constituency has said
                &quot;You won’t get grants unless your house is in poor
                condition.&quot; But when people say that their house is in a
                poor condition, it still takes up to two years before the work
                is carried out, and the poor conditions worsen during that
                two-year period.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is not a criticism of the Northern
                Ireland Housing Executive. There has been a lack of funding by
                the Department of the Environment, and the Assembly will have a
                chance to redress that if and when a Department responsible for
                housing is created. In the interim, I ask the Minister presently
                responsible for housing to reconsider this year’s allocation
                and see the serious effects that a lack of funding is having
                throughout Northern Ireland, and in the Foyle constituency in
                particular.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask two things from this debate: first,
                that the Assembly make housing a priority when it has a chance
                to discuss the matter; secondly, that in the interim the
                Minister who addressed the Assembly recently and also announced
                further cut-backs be asked to reverse that decision.</p>
