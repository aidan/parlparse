    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="a"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Local Government and Planning Reform</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice from the Minister of the Environment that he wishes to  make a statement.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment (Mr Poots)</strong>: With your permission, Mr Speaker, I wish to  make a statement about the reform of local government and the planning system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive&rsquo;s vision for the future shape of local  democracy is of strong, dynamic, citizen-focused local government built on  vibrant, healthy, prosperous, safe and sustainable communities. Central to that  vision is the provision of high-quality efficient services that respond to the  needs of people and continuously improve. On the eighteenth of this month, the  Executive brought that vision another step closer: first, by agreeing that I  should consult on proposals for the reorganisation of local government; and,  secondly, by endorsing my plans for a fundamental overhaul of the planning  system. Consequently, today I launch a consultation process on policy proposals  that will modernise the framework within which district councils operate, and  those proposals will, in due course, be translated into a draft Bill for the  Assembly to consider. With your permission, Mr Speaker, I also intend to  introduce the Planning Bill at the earliest opportunity. In transforming the  planning system, I will strengthen local democracy by devolving planning powers  to the 11 new councils and putting locally elected politicians at the heart of  the local decision-making process. I also propose to bring forward other  initiatives to build on the work agreed by the Executive and to give my  programme real momentum.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I turn first to the reorganisation and modernisation of  local government. Members will recall that the Executive&rsquo;s decision on the  future shape of local government provides the foundation to develop strong, effective  local government that will deliver improved outcomes for everyone in Northern Ireland.  Strong civil leadership, based on effective and inclusive local democracy, is  key to achieving these improved outcomes. I am pleased to announce today the  launch of a consultation setting out proposals that I believe will achieve the  Executive&rsquo;s vision. The proposals provide for efficient, fair and transparent  decision-making across local government. They will ensure that the highest  standards of behaviour are maintained. They set out a framework for a new  community planning process, and they propose a new regime to help improve how  councils deliver their services to ratepayers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Before I outline the key proposals, I record my thanks to  the strategic leadership board and its three policy development panels for the  support and guidance that they provided in helping to frame the proposals.  Indeed, the work of the board and panel members, who included elected  representatives from each of the main political parties, has proved to be  invaluable.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The first of the five areas that the consultation proposals  embrace is the introduction of new governance arrangements. I want to ensure  that councils operate to high standards, that they pursue equality and fairness  within a framework of checks and balances and that there is openness and  transparency in how they conduct their business.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The second area is the introduction of a new ethical  standards regime for local government. That would include a mandatory code of  conduct for councillors, with supporting mechanisms for the investigation and  adjudication of appeals.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The third area is the development of a new council-led  community planning process. I believe that an effective, statute-based  community planning process, led and facilitated by new councils, is critical to  delivering the Executive&rsquo;s vision for local government. The process will enable  councils to work in partnership with the full range of other sectors to link  the delivery of effective, joined-up services in their area to meet the  aspirations of local communities. The transfer of responsibility for the  delivery of a range of new functions, allied to the community planning process,  will enable councils to address the needs and aspirations of local communities.  However, I appreciate that district councils can do only what legislation  empowers them to do, and I recognise that there may be actions that they wish  to take that are not specifically provided for in their legal responsibilities.  To provide for that eventuality, it is proposed that district councils have a  new power of well-being. That new power would enable councils to take any  action that is not already the responsibility of another agency so that the  well-being of their district can be promoted or improved.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The fourth key area that the consultation proposals embrace  is the introduction of a new service delivery and performance improvement  framework for local government. That would involve a revised, more expansive  statutory duty for councils, requiring them to secure best value and to  continually improve the services they deliver to the ratepayer.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, I propose to establish a partnership panel for Northern Ireland  to formalise the relationships between the Executive and district councils and  to provide a forum to consider strategic issues collectively. I propose that  the panel consists of Ministers, particularly those whose Departments have a  significant policy relationship with local government, and representatives from  each of the 11 new councils. Full details of these reform and modernisation  proposals are set out in the consultation document that I am publishing today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I believe that these proposals, allied to the reforms of  the planning system, which I will shortly outline, are fundamental to our local  democracy. They will strengthen local decision-making and give elected  representatives, who understand the needs and aspirations of their community,  the opportunity to shape the areas in which they are elected.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Planning reform is also vital to the success of local  government reform, but it is in itself designed to improve the way in which the  planning system operates. Such reform has long been needed, but it is now a  crucial element of the Executive&rsquo;s programme to support economic recovery. I  intend to take forward the reforms of the planning system through a mixture of  legislation and other means. On the legislative side, with your permission, Mr  Speaker, I intend to introduce the Planning Bill at the earliest opportunity,  and I look forward to the Second Stage debate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Planning Bill will provide for the transfer of  development plan and development management powers from my Department to  councils within a timetable to be agreed by the Executive. Councils will no  longer be consultees; they will be the planning authorities, responsible for  drawing up their own development plans and making the vast majority of planning  decisions. The 11 new councils will be able to use the new local development  plans to provide a clear and realistic vision of how places should change and  what they will be like in future. The plan will support that vision by  indicating clearly where development, including regeneration, should take place  and what form it should take. In addition, the opportunity to develop  appropriate linkages with the proposed community planning responsibilities  should not be missed. Councils will also be responsible for determining  planning applications. Councillors will be the decision-makers. They will have  the recommendations of their professional planners, but they will make  decisions and live with the consequences.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a sea change for councils and councillors, for  those who work in the planning system and for developers, agents and the public  who use the system. I will do everything in my power to prepare the way for  that change. I will take practical steps to help councils, planners and the  public to prepare.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I mentioned my intention to bring forward other initiatives  to build on my legislative proposals for reform and modernisation. I have still  not received clarity from the Executive on the local government reform delivery  timetable, and I will continue to pursue that matter vigorously in the  Executive. Nevertheless, a modernised local government, strengthened by the  devolution of planning powers, is a worthwhile goal. Since I am determined to  drive that work forward, I have decided to take practical steps to reinvigorate  the local government and planning reform changes. None of them requires  legislative change. My Department has already brought together responsibility  for all local government and planning functions, which means that we have a  single coherent programme of policy, legislation and delivery of local  government and planning reform with one team at the helm.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">By 1 April 2011, I will have transformed the Planning  Service to anticipate as closely as possible the proposed arrangements. The  Planning Service&rsquo;s status as an agency will end on 31 March 2011. Agency status  is a legacy of direct rule, involving the duplication of structures and  functions; it is not needed under devolution. It is costly, and it gets in the  way of decision-making. On 1 April 2011, the functions of the Planning Service  and the people who deliver them will have been absorbed into the core of my  Department. By the same date, planning functions will also have been  reorganised to anticipate the transfer of development plans and development  management to councils. That will mean a local planning operations division  taking operational responsibility for the development plan and development  management functions that will, in due course, transfer from my Department to  councils.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A strategic planning operations division will take forward  the responsibilities that will remain in the Department following local  government reform. That will clarify the functions, people and other resources  that are to transfer to local government &mdash; issues on which the local government  sector has long called for clarity. We need a local office structure capable of  providing an excellent service to the 26 councils and, in due course, to the 11  councils.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Rationalising the six existing divisional planning offices  into five area planning offices designed around the 11 council clusters will  provide for an affordable, effective and consistently robust service across Northern Ireland,  and that is what I have decided to do. By 1 April 2011, we will reorganise to  have a northern, a south Antrim, a western and a southern area planning office,  each of which will cover two of the 11 council groups. The Belfast office will cover the remaining  three. That is illustrated on the map that accompanies written copies of the  statement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The strategic planning operations division will take  responsibility for the functions that my Department will retain on the transfer  of development management responsibilities to local government. It will also  advise the local planning operations division on development plans, development  management and design and landscape. It will also be responsible for processing  applications for strategic projects and for developing the Northern Ireland  marine plan, which will be prepared by May 2014.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To increase clarity, I will put in place a formal written  scheme by which my successors and I will delegate decision-making authority to  the Department and to identify the situations in which that authority may be  withdrawn. I will publish the scheme for everyone to see. The scheme will serve  as a model for council schemes of delegation when planning functions transfer  and will build on the existing streamlined arrangements. I am also examining  the financing of my Department&rsquo;s planning functions; to be sustainable we must  live within our means. That means matching our resources to our workload. We  are not charging the right fee for the job. Smaller, simpler applications, such  as single houses or modest industrial units, are subsidising the largest and  most complex proposals that are worth many millions of pounds to developers.  Planning Service income does not cover its costs. This year, with the agreement  of the Environment Committee, I increased fees in line with inflation, and I  anticipate that, in future, fees will be kept in line with inflation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have completed the first phase of my fees review, and I  am now consulting on proposals for making the fee structure fairer and more  realistic. Applying my proposals to the current level of applications would  bring in &pound;3 million to &pound;3&middot;5 million extra income for the Planning Service. At  the same time, we are working to resize and reshape so that we have the right  staff in the right place to provide an excellent service. The changes that I  announce today give us an opportunity to restructure senior management and  strengthen front line delivery.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to broaden and deepen the debate about the future of  planning and to hear what experts in planning and users of the planning system  think. I will set up and chair a planning forum to involve key stakeholders in  the planning field, the development industry and local and central government.  I expect to convene that group in the new year. I will also re-emphasise and  push forward the non-statutory elements of the existing planning reform  programme, including the delivery of streamlining, e-PIC (Electronic Planning  Information for Citizens) and a new approach to the development and delivery of  a suite of more succinct and focused planning policies.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I intend to develop and deliver a pilot programme to test  the proposed consultative and practical working arrangements between the new  local operations directorate and the 11 council groups. We will also use the  pilot programme to test the proposed governance arrangements and the provisions  for community planning. The pilot programme will be of particular interest to  the Department for Social Development, whose urban regeneration  responsibilities have been earmarked for transfer to local government. I have,  therefore, written to the Minister for Social Development to ask whether his  Department wishes to be involved in individual pilots. I intend to begin with a  small number of pilots in April 2011, with a view to their being progressively  rolled out across all 11 council groups by April 2012. I hope that, by engaging  council and departmental staff, the pilots will enable us to test new  arrangements to ensure that they are robust. I also hope that they will build  capacity in the run-up to the creation of the 11 new councils.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Before I close, I record my appreciation of the work of  Planning Service staff in making improvements over the past two years. Over  that period, the Planning Service has introduced reforms to improve the  planning system, including promoting the predictability of the planning system,  the speeding up of planning decisions and improving customer experience. The  introduction of two special project teams with a focus on processing  applications of social or economic significance to Northern Ireland and employing  pre-application discussions has resulted in some 90 strategic applications  being processed. That has amounted to planning approvals representing  investment well in excess of &pound;2 billion, bringing with it associated  construction jobs and post-development job creation. Since April 2009, a  further 34 economically significant applications have also been processed, the  majority within six months. They include Bombardier Shorts, Randox Laboratories  and the Titanic Quarter to name but a few. Moreover, since devolution,  Ministers have used planning policy as an effective way of responding to real  issues that affect communities. Planning staff in my Department have  facilitated that process, producing a number of planning policy statements,  including PPS 21, &lsquo;Sustainable Development in the Countryside&rsquo;. I have  deliberately adopted a new style for those PPSs, which are now shorter, sharper  and more accessible to developers, the public and planners.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The development and implementation of the new streamlined  consultation scheme, in partnership with local government colleagues, has been  an outstanding success in speeding up the process of non-contentious  applications. All 26 council areas have adopted the scheme, which has  dramatically reduced the average time required to process and issue approvals,  the impact being that 50% of applications are now processed and approved in, on  average, 40 working days, or 8 weeks. Furthermore, work is continuing in order  to raise the bar to 60% of applications by the end of the business year. Those  short-term reforms have not only speeded up the progress of applications  through the statutory planning process but improved the transparency and  predictability of the planning system, which is of benefit to investors and the  public at large. Furthermore, it is good to note that the majority of Planning  Service customers rated their experience positively. Two years ago, only 32% of  customers rated the overall service provided by the Planning Service as  satisfactory. Today, some 63% of customers express satisfaction with the  overall service provided. That significant turnaround in speed, predictability  and customer experience stands testament to the dedication and professionalism  of all those who work in the Planning Service, and their continued commitment  and professionalism will be instrumental in taking forward the changes to come.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Speaker, it will be evident to you and to Members that I  am still committed to reforming local government. It is clear that the  Executive as a whole are still committed to reforming local government, and I  think that you will agree that the legislative and non-legislative measures that  I have outlined are significant steps forward in achieving that goal. I look  forward to working with Members and local government representatives to  reinvigorate the local government and planning reform programmes, which will ultimately  deliver a new model for local democracy and a vastly improved planning system.  I shall end with a quotation from King Whitney Jnr:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Change has a considerable psychological impact on the  human mind. To the fearful it is threatening because it means that things may  get worse. To the hopeful it is encouraging because things may get better. To  the confident it is inspiring because the challenge exists to make things  better.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Let us, together, demonstrate that we are confident  and that we will make things better. That is what I have set out to demonstrate  today, and that is what I will strive to deliver. I commend the proposals to  the House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for the Environment (Mr Boylan)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a  Cheann Comhairle. That was a long statement that has huge implications for  planning in the North. My question will be in three parts. First, the Minister  indicated that he will take forward reform through a mixture of legislation and  other means. Are his proposals based on the planning reform Bill, or does he  need other legislation to implement them? Secondly, he knows that the Committee  is interested in the redeployment of planning staff and the restructuring of  the Planning Service. What further implications will his proposals have for  planning staff, the location of staff and divisional offices? Thirdly, the  Minister said that he would initiate pilot programmes. Where will they take  place, and will he clarify what they will involve?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I thank the Chairperson for his succinct questioning.  First, the planning reform Bill will be the key driver for all planning issues,  and it will allow planning to be delivered by local government and for local  government to be the decision-makers. However, the proposals are inextricably  linked to the reorganisation Bill, without which it is unlikely, to say the  least, that the Executive will allow planning to be passed to local government.  The reorganisation Bill will deal with the code of conduct and ethical standards,  giving us absolute confidence that we can transfer the process into a system  that is robust and will stand up to tests. Therefore, both Bills must be  enacted before the handover can take place.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The staffing arrangements at most offices will remain  unchanged as a consequence of the process. There will be some changes in the  southern area offices in Downpatrick and Craigavon. We will maintain the  Craigavon site as the main office, while Downpatrick will be a sub-office. Some  staff in the Downpatrick office may transfer to Craigavon, while others may  transfer to Belfast because certain councils  will be affected under the new Belfast  office proposals. The proposal to remove agency status from the Department and  reorganise the offices will save &pound;677,000. That is another significant step  towards helping the Planning Service to live within its means.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The establishment of the pilot programmes will require  consultation with local councils to identify which wants to be first to deliver  a pilot programme. Undoubtedly, there will be competition among councils to be  the first. That is good, because it will be a vigorous process that will be  successful and will lead the way in delivering community planning in local  council areas.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement and welcome the proposals that he has put  forward. I am tempted to ask the question that is on everyone&rsquo;s lips: who is  King Whitney Jnr? However, I will restrict my question to the part of the  Minister&rsquo;s statement that deals with local government reform. He mentioned new  governance arrangements. When will those new governance arrangements for local  councils come into effect?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: On the question of King Whitney Jnr, what a philistine  Peter Weir has demonstrated himself to be.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The timing of the establishment of the new arrangements  will be subject to the consultation process. They will certainly be in place  for the 11-council model. Should they be introduced into the 26-council model?  I am quite satisfied to do that, and, were we to transfer planning powers to  the 26 councils ahead of the establishment of the 11-council model, it would be  absolutely essential. My preference is that the code of conduct, governance  standards and so forth would be applied to the 26-council model on the  enactment of the reorganisation Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. I understand that the new Planning Bill  contains hundreds of clauses and will bring about radical change to the  planning system. Why has it taken three and a half years to get here? Given the  significance of the changes, can the Minister assure me that there is  sufficient time remaining for full consultation with the public and at the  crucial Committee scrutiny stage, so that we get things right and avoid costly  mistakes that would affect the community and, potentially, the economy?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: There have already been two public consultations on the  Planning Bill. When it goes to the Committee, it will be up to the Committee to  decide whether that Bill will go out for a third consultation with the  community. That will be a big ask of the Assembly. It is the largest Bill that  will come before the Assembly, as it contains approximately 240 clauses. I  accept that the timetable is tight. It will probably involve additional work  for the members of the Environment Committee.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate the work that the Committee has done thus far.  It has had a heavier legislative programme than any other Committee. It has  nine pieces of legislation to complete by April 2010. I recognise the heavy  workload that has been put on the Environment Committee, but there is a public  expectation that the Assembly and the Executive should deliver. I have sought  to introduce legislation at the behest of the House, such as the Clean  Neighbourhoods and Environment Bill and the High Hedges Bill, and I have  increased the workload, but that is what the public want. It is important that  Members come together to deliver for the public and demonstrate that the  Assembly is working for the benefit of the community and is not like the direct  rule administration, in which civil servants called the shots. We, the elected  representatives, are calling the shots on behalf of the public and are  delivering for the public.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.00 am</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  statement. Some of us have had rather different experiences of the  implementation of equality practices at local government level. Will the  Minister explain and give us an overview and some detail on what practices and  mechanisms will be put in place through the new governance arrangements to  ensure that equality is put at the heart of local government? What oversight  mechanisms will operate at departmental level to ensure that that happens?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The local government (reorganisation) Bill has been a long  time in waiting. I have always been keen to introduce that. It comes about as a  result of the work of the strategic leadership board and the policy development  panels, on which the five main parties have all worked to reach agreement. My  colleague Mr Weir could, perhaps, answer the question better than me, because  he did a lot of work on the board.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Essentially, we are looking at a call-in system for  situations in which 15% of council members are unhappy with a proposal. For  controversial decisions, 80% support is required in councils. When councils  cannot agree a formula for power sharing, the d&rsquo;Hondt mechanism will be used.  Therefore, equality and fairness are at the centre of the reorganisation Bill,  which will seek to ensure that minorities, whether in the west or south of the  Province where there are unionist minorities or, indeed, in the north or east  of the Province where there are nationalist minorities, are protected and that  the views of people in minority communities are heard and respected.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lyttle</strong>: I  welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. He said that he has set a challenging  timetable for the Environment Committee. Some would argue that the delay in the  legislation has set an impossible timetable. Thankfully, I am not on that  Committee to contend with that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Given the ongoing lack of clarity and the non-delivery of  savings from the review of public administration (RPA) to date, will the  Minister commit his full financial support to the Northern Ireland Local  Government Association&rsquo;s (NILGA) improvement, collaboration and efficiency  (ICE) programme and give his assessment of any potential savings that could be  made from joint management teams for local councils?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The Member said that the timetable is &ldquo;impossible&rdquo;. It is  impossible only if we do not set ourselves targets that we aim to achieve. I do  not believe for one instant that anything here is impossible. If people have  the will to do it, it will be done. If that involves Committee meetings late  into the evenings, that is what will happen. At ministerial level, we have many  late evenings. If we want to deliver for the public, we will do it. If we want  to lie back, we will fail. I do not believe that the Assembly is in the mood  for lying back; I think that it is in the mood for delivering.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member asked about my commitment to supporting local  government and about the financial arrangements. We have been working closely  with NILGA on its ICE programme, and we are looking to use the collaboration  process to improve efficiencies. NILGA has indicated that, over the four-year  period, it can deliver around 7&middot;5% efficiency savings in local government. That  is not a challenging ask, because we, in government, have had to deliver a 3%  saving year on year. In fact, in the past year, my Department had to find 12%  savings in one year through in-year savings. Therefore, a target of 7&middot;5% over  the four years will be a significant benefit. It will help us to deliver local  government reform, and it will help to smooth the way for amalgamation by  demonstrating savings up front and allowing those savings to be applied to the  costs that are associated with the amalgamation process. We are able to do that  in a much more structured way than by rushing ahead in 2011. We can make those  achievements in a way that does not add additional bane and burdens on  taxpayers or ratepayers.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. The Environment Committee, of which I  am a member, has a heavy workload, but we will meet the time frame. How will  the Minister ensure consistency of approach in applying the allocation method  across councils?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I propose that, as in section 18 of the Northern Ireland  Act 1998, which sets out the application of the d&rsquo;Hondt system for the  allocation of ministerial portfolios, the legislation will set out the detailed  process for that application and for the other available methods. A council  could consider the Sainte-Lagu&euml; method and other means of power sharing, but,  if it were not to agree to those means, d&rsquo;Hondt would be the fallback method.  It is up to councils. They are masters of their own destiny in that respect,  and they can identify their means of ensuring that people will have their  voices heard. However, if they cannot agree, d&rsquo;Hondt will be used, and that  might be the preferred option for many councils.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. During the previous consultation on reorganisation,  the Minister indicated that he was keen to pursue savings through the  introduction of a single waste management authority as well as delivery of  back-office services for local authorities through one business services  organisation. Will those proposals be included in the local government reform  consultation?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Those proposals were not accepted by local government or  by parties in the House. If people want them to be included, I am quite happy  with that. The reform of local government will be predicated on achieving  efficiency, and I do not mind how that efficiency is achieved. If councils do  not want to do it through a business services organisation and they can  demonstrate that they can achieve the same efficiencies by other means, I am  quite happy to go down that other route.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ultimately, we want to achieve efficiencies. In a region  the size of Northern Ireland,  a single waste authority makes sense because it gives greater capacity in the  procurement and selling of what are now highly valuable products from the waste  stream. With the House&rsquo;s agreement, we could move forward quite quickly.  However, if the House does not wish to go there, I cannot and will not do so,  even though there are benefits and advantages to it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. He will be aware that the Planning Reform  Bill deals with development plans. My constituency is part of the Belfast metropolitan area  plan (BMAP), which has been delayed for years and has cost more than &pound;8  million. Under the new proposals, will the council areas that make up the BMAP  area be able to develop their own plans?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Yes, each new council cluster will be responsible for the  development of its area plans; therefore although they will remain in a larger  office, a development plan team can be put in to develop an area plan. Under  the new proposals in the Planning Reform Bill, which we will probably debate in  a number of weeks, we should be able to reduce the time for delivering a  development plan from the current six and a half years to about three years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That is a major boost for everyone, including business and  the public, because people will be able to see what is likely to be developed  in their area over the next number of years. Those processes will be able to be  turned around quickly, less speculation will take place and there will be more  clarity. Someone may choose not to buy a home if they realise that there could  be intensive development close to it. Equally, someone might wish to buy a home  beside which moderate development is to take place, and that could affect their  decision.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">All that is hugely to the benefit of the public in allowing  development plan processes to take place, first by a local government team that  will know the needs of its area; and, secondly, in changing the means of  carrying out the development plan process, putting public issues up front so  that they can be dealt with early and allowing people a greater say in the  development plan process.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  I thank the Minister for today&rsquo;s statement. There is an enormous amount in it  that we welcome. I hesitate to say that the Environment Committee will relish  the challenge posed. However, we will do our best. Given that there will be  significant new powers and ethical standards for councillors, has the DUP  finally agreed to end the conflict of interest caused by dual mandates?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I spoke recently to a senior council official in the west  of the Province who thought that it was daft to do away with dual mandates,  because he found that it is particularly effective to have Members who are  lobbying on local government issues and who understand those issues. It would  be a huge loss and a damaging blow if MLAs who happen to be serving on councils  were removed from them, because the skills, abilities and knowledge that they  have garnered would be lost. MLAs give up their time to serve on councils, and  they work extremely hard to deliver for people locally.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am not into this political correctness nonsense of going  down a particular route to appease a few people. We should be concentrating on  delivering good local government. The MLAs who serve on local government are  doing a very good job.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My attendance record and work rate in local government were  considerably better than those of many other members, some of whom were  apparently full-time councillors and many of whom were either retired or  working part-time. As an MLA, and even as a Minister, I was able to attend more  meetings and get involved in more local government issues, because I was  committed. It is important that people are committed to their job, and many  MLAs are totally committed to serving on councils, because they want to serve  the public.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I note with interest the Minister&rsquo;s comments during exchanges with other  Members about the legislative time frame and the role of the Environment Committee.  The Minister stated that he has not yet received clarity from the Executive,  who appear to operate the legislative programme on a lastminute.com basis.  However, will the Minister assure the House that his Department has the  capacity to meet the legislative timetable? Will he indicate what the budget  is, given the shortfall of over &pound;7 million in the Planning Service budget?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Let us deal with what is in the statement rather than straying from it to the  Budget.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: All that I can say to the Member is that her party is part  of the Executive. Therefore, if there is gridlock or a problem, perhaps her  party representatives should ensure that that is not the case.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I, too, welcome this morning&rsquo;s statement. As one who has served in local  government for 35 years, I feel that the statement is timely. Will the Minister  comment on the transition committees that were established? Some of them worked  much better than others, because the people concerned were of a mind to ensure  that they worked. Therefore, does the Minister plan to ensure that the people  engaged in the pilot schemes, when they are established, take them seriously so  that we can start to move forward? What will the consequences be if they do not  do so, as has happened in the past?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: As regards the pilot schemes, ultimately, this is about  delivering better local government and preparing the way. This will happen;  therefore, the people who dilly-dally, do not perform correctly, procrastinate,  and delay for ever and a day are not helping their case. It is important that  people contribute, apply considerable effort, and get real about doing the job  in order to prepare their areas. That is so in many councils in Northern Ireland,  and it has been the case in the preparations for councils&rsquo; coming together.  Many transition committees are still working on delivering efficiency  programmes despite that fact that their members are not being paid. Therefore,  let us give credit where credit is due.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Councils that have been less inclined to change will miss  out, but those that move ahead will benefit in the long term. If people are  real about delivering at local level, they will get involved; and they will be  efficient and effective, because their work will deliver for local communities.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: I,  too, welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement and the proposed powers that will go to  councils. Does the Minister plan to devolve some of those powers to councils  prior to RPA occurring?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: That will be for the Executive to decide. Once the draft  local government (reorganisation) Bill is passed, and the code of conduct and  ethical standards regime are in place, I think that they will be quite willing  to transfer those powers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If the political will exists, the Department of the  Environment will create the means whereby the Planning Service can be  transferred to local government. There is no reason, other than a political  reason, why that could not or should not happen. We believe that the 26-council  model can more easily get the community planning process up and running,  because there is a stronger local base in the 26-council model than in an  11-council model. However, it is up to the Minister for Regional Development and  the Minister for Social Development to decide whether the responsibilities of  their Departments should be transferred to local government before the  11-council model comes into place.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Planning Service should be transferred before the  11-council model is established. It should go to the 26-council model on the  basis that we have a code of conduct, an ethical standards regime, and that  proper training will be put in place for councillors to prepare the way for the  11-council model thereafter.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Girvan</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement and I welcome most of the proposals that  have been put forward. The statement alludes to the Department of the  Environment having corresponded with the Department for Social Development on  urban regeneration. Has there been any feedback from that Department on its  willingness to engage in a similar process as the Department of the  Environment? It would be welcome if we could work together and see proper  joined-up government in the full functions that can be delivered through a  reorganisation of local government.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Under its previous and current Ministers, the Department  for Social Development has been a willing partner in the process. It supports  the 11-council model and the transfer of powers, particularly those on urban  regeneration, to local government. Should the draft local government  (reorganisation) Bill become law, it will be a matter for that Department  whether it supports the transfer of powers to local government prior to 2011.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department for Regional Development also has powers  that could be transferred to local government, and I encourage it to consider  transferring those powers in advance of the 11-council model. For example, car  parking is hugely problematic for local communities. Some of the biggest issues  that local shopkeepers have is about how car parking is handled and how people  can be put off from coming to particular towns because of the effective rule  that the &ldquo;red coats&rdquo; apply. It would be much better if such issues were dealt  with by local government, which could be more sympathetic to local community  needs and ensure that car parking is still carried out efficiently.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. I welcome the statement, and, as a  member of the Environment Committee, I look forward to considering the  legislation. However, the statement is based largely on the 11-council model.  Does the Minister not agree that it does not make economic sense to proceed  with the 11-council model at the present time? The &pound;150 million costs are  front-loaded and will have to be found from departmental budgets, which are  being slashed. If there are any proposed savings, they will only be achieved  over 25 years.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The Member makes a valid point. That is one of the reasons  why we did not proceed in 2011. We could have rushed in and had to pick up a  large bill during an economic recession, when it was evident that public sector  cuts were coming our way. Those cuts have now come, and we are not in a  position to do this without causing real pain to other front line services.  Therefore, we propose to identify where we can achieve efficiencies up front.  We will start to deliver those efficiencies up front and, subsequently, reduce  the pain involved with local government.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Local government will already have achieved savings and  identified a mode of achieving even greater savings through the amalgamation  process. There is a cost and a benefit to amalgamation. We want to create an  element of those benefits up front before the cost is applied. That will reduce  the pain that results from the amalgamation process.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: It is  a pity that there is such slow movement in the development of local councils.  Nevertheless, I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. The Alliance Party is very  supportive of the community planning process. Can the Minister assure the House  that his new model of community planning will take into account the Minister of  Justice&rsquo;s new proposals on policing and community safety partnerships and the  community relations duties under the cohesion, sharing and integration  strategy?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I am committed to working with all the Ministers who have  a role to play to ensure that we do this as well as possible. The power of  well-being is very important. At this moment in time, there are areas that fall  down because no Department or council has a statutory responsibility. There are  issues of importance to the public that we fail to deal with. Through the  community planning process, the power of well-being will enable local  government to work in conjunction with Departments to deal with those issues  and make communities better places.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Justice has a key role to play in working  with the Department of the Environment and, indeed, local government to ensure  that our communities are safer and better places that families, younger people  and older people can all enjoy &mdash; a safe community which they are proud of and  will work to make better. I am more than happy to work with the Department of  Justice on these issues.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  declare an interest as an outgoing member of North Down Borough Council. I,  too, welcome the statement, but it is very much a soft landing for the RPA. It  is disappointing that there are clearly still divisions in the Executive over  the longer-term direction of local government in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to ask the Minister about governance and his reference  to d&rsquo;Hondt as the backstop of arrangements if local agreement cannot be found.  How wedded is the Minister to that method, bearing in mind that it can produce  strange anomalies in different parts of Northern Ireland? If it were  introduced, it would effectively remove the prospect of any independent holding  civic office in Northern    Ireland. Based on current voting patterns,  it would also remove the prospect of a nationalist ever holding civic office in  places such as Castlereagh and Lisburn or a unionist ever holding civic office  in places such as Derry or Newry.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: First, I do not agree that the statement is a soft landing  for the reform of public administration. The content of the statement  demonstrates that the reform of public administration has gone through a  thought process and consideration of how it can achieve the desired outcome in  a structured way that is based on solid foundations, can deliver for many  decades to come, has not been rushed into and will not leave people with a host  of complaints because we did not get it right. The proposals create the  opportunity for us to get it right over the next number of years and ensure  that we have local government that people will benefit from.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am no more in love with the d&rsquo;Hondt mechanism than anyone  else. The d&rsquo;Hondt arrangement does not have to be in place. Councils can agree  other processes whereby even members of the Alliance Party could become chairs  of committees, mayors or deputy mayors. I appreciate the Member&rsquo;s concerns, and  he did declare an interest. However, we will create a system that ensures that  minority voices are heard in councils and are not overruled. Councils are  masters of their own destinies, and if they want to identify and go with a  system other than d&rsquo;Hondt, I am more than willing to allow them to do that. I  will welcome those councils&rsquo; decisions on what is best for their future.</p>

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I call on the Minister for Employment and Learning to move the Further  Consideration Stage of the Student Loans (Amendment) Bill.</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">Moved. &mdash; [The Minister for Employment and Learning (Mr  Kennedy).]</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  As no amendments have been selected, there is no opportunity to discuss the  Student Loans (Amendment) Bill today. Members will, of course, be able to have  a full debate at Final Stage. Further Consideration Stage is, therefore,  concluded. The Bill stands referred to the Speaker.</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="c"></a>Departments (Transfer of Functions) Order (Northern Ireland)  2010</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister) (Mr Newton)</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That the Departments (Transfer of Functions) Order (Northern Ireland)  2010 be affirmed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The statutory rule has been made under powers contained in  article 8 of the Departments (Northern    Ireland) Order 1999, which provides that the  2010 Order must be laid for approval by affirmative resolution of the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The 2010 Order will transfer certain functions of the  Department of the Environment, under section 25 of the Northern Ireland  (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006, to the Office of the First Minister and  deputy First Minister. The functions that are being transferred relate to the  provision of guidance and strategies in support of the implementation by public  authorities of the statutory duty to promote the achievement of sustainable  development.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The transfer reconciles the legislative position in respect  of sustainable development functions to the current administrative dispensation  and is necessary at this time to support and underpin the delivery of the  Executive&rsquo;s commitments in its sustainable development strategy, which was  published earlier this year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I commend the Order to the House and look forward to  further positive progress on sustainable development.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister  (Mr Elliott)</strong>: The Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy  First Minister considered the proposal for the statutory rule on 23 June 2010  and indicated that it was content with the policy merits of the proposal. The  Committee further considered the statutory rule at its meeting on 17 November  2010 and resolved that it should be affirmed by the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Order seeks to transfer certain functions regarding the  sustainable development policy from the Department of the Environment to the  Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister. That is required as  OFMDFM has published a sustainable development strategy. Therefore, it is  necessary to amend the provision so that it refers instead to a strategy that  has been published by the Office of the First Minister and deputy First  Minister (OFMDFM).</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee resolved that the statutory rule should be  affirmed by the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Would the junior Minister like to say anything to conclude?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr Newton)</strong>: No, thank you.</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">Question put and agreed to.</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">Resolved:</p>

    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="d"></a>Committee Business</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Freedom from Fear Campaign</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30 minutes for  the debate. The proposer will have 10 minutes in which to propose the motion,  and 10 minutes in which to make a winding-up speech. All other Members who are  called to speak will have five minutes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Employment and Learning (Mrs D Kelly)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes with concern the high incidence of  abuse, threats and physical violence against shopworkers, which is likely to  increase in the run up to Christmas; pledges its support for the Freedom from  Fear campaign organised by the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers;  and calls on the Minister for Employment and Learning to pursue the issues  raised by the campaign with his Executive colleagues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Once again, I rise as the Chairperson of the Committee for  Employment and Learning to move an extremely relevant and important motion that  affects a great number of people in the constituencies of every Member. The  Committee is becoming increasingly well known for bringing to the Chamber real  issues that affect the lives of ordinary people. The Committee has a clear view  that that is a key role for Committees: connecting people with the Assembly and  bringing their issues to the attention of Members.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister for Employment and Learning for being  present to hear and to respond to the debate. I know that the Minister shares  the Committee&rsquo;s concerns about the intimidation and abuse that shopworkers  face, and the Committee greatly appreciates his help in highlighting that issue  to the other Executive Ministers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee decided to bring this issue to the Chamber  after receiving a briefing from the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied  Workers (USDAW). The Committee was horrified to hear from shopworkers some of  the terrible abuse that they and their colleagues suffer at the hands of the  public. Statistics show that a shopworker is verbally abused, threatened with  violence or physically attacked every minute of every working day. Members were  greatly moved to hear of a young woman who worked in a shop and was beaten up  by a violent customer. That young woman did not know that she was pregnant at  the time, and she subsequently lost her baby. The Committee heard of other  incidents in which shopworkers were abused verbally, spat on or beaten up  because they were not able to serve customers, often because the customer was  not old enough to buy alcohol and was refused service.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Just this weekend past, we heard about the kidnapping of a  west Belfast  shopworker, whose family was held captive while she was forced to take money  from her employer&rsquo;s premises. That is not a one-off example. That sort of crime  is becoming more prevalent, and shopworkers feel that they have nowhere to  turn.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That is the sort of situation that many shopworkers deal  with day in and day out. We have all found ourselves stressed out when  shopping, especially in the run-up to Christmas, and have been short-tempered  with a shop assistant who could not satisfy our demands. I am not suggesting  that any Members would resort to violence in such a situation &mdash; at least, I  hope not &mdash; but I think that we have all acted in a way that we are not proud of  as shoppers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Every year since 2002, USDAW has run its Freedom from Fear  campaign in the run-up to Christmas to remind people that shopworkers have  rights and deserve respect. Those workers are often seen as being beneath  people&rsquo;s contempt, because they may work for the minimum wage, and they find it  difficult to talk back because they might get into trouble with their employer.  People set too much store on the saying, &ldquo;The customer is always right.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, a culture of silence has grown up around  this issue because many employers do not want to draw attention to staff  complaints. All employers keep accident books in which staff accidents are  logged. Why can employers not also keep books in which incidents of staff abuse  can be logged? Too many employers are not taking the problem seriously, and  their staff are expected just to get over it. Let me remind you of the young  shopworker who lost her baby. Just get over it? I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Quite naturally, shopworkers are looking to the Assembly  and their elected representatives to do something for them. One reason why the  Committee tabled the motion is to highlight to Members and to the Executive the  intimidation and abuse suffered by shopworkers. However, specific issues have  to be dealt with.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A key issue that was highlighted to the Committee was proof  of age in refusing a sale. Shopworkers are advised that if someone looks under  25, they should be asked to show ID when seeking to buy alcohol. This aspect of  shopworkers&rsquo; jobs provokes the greatest level of abuse. People working in local  shops are often the worst affected, with their homes being targeted by people  who they have refused to sell alcohol to as they are under age. Sometimes  stones are thrown and windows in their homes are broken.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The purpose of the Freedom from Fear campaign, as well as  to highlight issues around the abuse that I described, is to encourage  employers to improve safety and security for workers in retail outlets, to  encourage the public to stop to think about what they are doing, and to give  shopworkers a platform from which to speak out and to reject that abuse.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Just yesterday, we debated a motion about driving under the  influence of drink and drugs. We must stem the tide of violence in our society,  which is fuelled by cheap alcohol. What does all-day drinking do to our  society? The evidence is all around us. The Committee has been asked to  advocate the introduction of a more robust proof-of-age scheme. Members are  keen to see the courts setting an example and dealing more harshly with people  who abuse shopworkers. Publicity is also required to ensure that people realise  that it is a criminal offence for people who are under the age of 18 to attempt  to buy alcohol.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee strongly supports the promotion of Think 25  schemes. I ask Members to reflect on the fact that the retail sector is one of  the few areas where jobs are still being advertised. Many people work at a  second job in retail to make ends meet. The next shopworker to suffer abuse  could be your daughter, your son, your brother, your mother, your sister or  your father. The Committee would like people to stop to think about how they  would react if one of their friends or loved ones was attacked just doing their  job. Think how we all react when NHS workers or Fire and Rescue Service workers  are attacked. Why should shopworkers not receive our support in the same way?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If Members take no other message away from today&rsquo;s debate,  they should simply remember that there are thousands of shopworkers in Northern Ireland,  and they are looking to us to protect them. Are we going to let them down? What  will you say to them on the doorsteps when you are canvassing? I thank the  Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers for bringing the issue to the  Committee&rsquo;s attention through my party colleague Pat Ramsey. I also thank the  Minister again for raising it with his Executive colleagues.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  support this very worthy motion. As the Chairperson indicated, the issue was  brought to the Committee by USDAW, which is the trade union that looks after  shopworkers. It is to be commended not simply for its actions this year, but  for its campaign over a number of years to highlight the issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is particularly pertinent that the motion is brought  before the House shortly before Christmas, because the tensions in shops during  the Christmas rush can tend to exacerbate a pre-existing problem. It is  important that the Assembly speaks with one voice today and sends out a clear  message that no form of abuse, violence or threats against any shopworkers can  be acceptable in any circumstances and must be utterly condemned. Therefore,  there should be strong support for the motion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The figures from the USDAW survey are shocking. The survey  indicated that, in 2009, one in 10 shopworkers had been physically assaulted,  and 29% of shopworkers had been verbally abused. Over the previous year, 32% of  shopworkers, which is one in three, had been threatened. Whatever tensions  there are, that is simply unacceptable. Therefore, we need to send out a clear  message.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As was indicated, it is about showing respect to  shopworkers. It is also about customers showing self-control. The proposer of  the motion indicated that, at some stage, we have all done something in shops  that we should not have done. However, I would like to think that I have not  been abusive in any way. I certainly fall into the category of someone who has  made the odd wrong purchase now and again, but it has to be said, in respect of  people &mdash; [Interruption.] I know that the Minister bought some dodgy goods back  in 1998.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning &nbsp;(Mr Kennedy)</strong>:  That you helped to write.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: No,  I did not &mdash; but, anyway.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There can be no excuse for such behaviour. Everyone should  be able to exercise self-control. Also, the message must be sent to shop  owners. Most shop owners are good but, in some cases, as has been indicated,  there is underlying pressure to minimise staff complaints, perhaps to maintain  a shop&rsquo;s reputation. Sometimes, that is by way of not recording incidents  properly. It is important that support is given.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The issue of underage sales has been raised. It is  important that the system is proper and robust. Too often, young people, in  particular, who try to purchase alcohol or cigarettes, take the view that a  shopworker is being officious. That worker is simply enforcing the law, and we  need to have a robust system to ensure that that is done properly. I suspect  that if the Chairperson and I went into a shop and had to prove that we were  over 25, it would not be the most difficult thing in the world to do. However,  in many cases, it is difficult to tell someone&rsquo;s age. A robust system is needed  to ensure that workers can do that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As has been said, we need to look at the current legal  provision. Some time ago, greater sanctions were put in place to ensure that a  range of public sector workers, particularly those in the emergency services,  were protected. Indeed, sanctions were added. As USDAW made clear, we need to  look at widening that to include all public-facing workers, so as to ensure  that, irrespective of whether people work in the public sector or the private  sector, if they interact with customers or members of the public, they get the  protection that they deserve.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">All of us, irrespective of our involvement with shops, are  aware of the issue from personal experience. I suspect that either we or our  staff have had to endure abuse from people who have come through the door of  our constituency offices. Quite often, they have been under the influence of  drink. The issue is widespread in society. The motion is timely, and I urge the  House to support it unanimously.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. In common with the two Members who  have already spoken, I support this important motion. As a Committee member, I  am delighted and proud to be associated with it, as was the previous Member.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During the past number of years, the Assembly has been no  stranger to presentations from various groups, including the trade union movement.  They have brought the real-life issues that affect our constituents to our  door. I take the opportunity to commend the presentation that the trade union  gave to the Committee. During our conversation on real-life issues, I was moved  enough to suggest that the Committee brought such a motion to the House. In  fairness, it was supported unanimously by Committee members. I believe that we  were all thinking the same thing at that time. It is now a matter of how the  Assembly plays its part to take that step further.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also take the opportunity to welcome the Minister to the  debate. I look forward to his contribution and to see whether the Committee and  the Department can deal with the issue collectively. I also thank the Research  and Library Service for the information that it has provided.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Chairperson said earlier, the Committee was  horrified to hear about the abuse that has taken place. Some of it could, in  the scheme of things, be described as minor, and some as major. However, I do not  believe that abuse should be described as one or the other: any form of abuse  towards any shopworker is a major incident and should be treated as such.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Peter Weir highlighted statistics that we received on the  incidence of violent attacks, threats and verbal abuse. There is a stark  reminder that, every year, thousands of shopworkers &mdash; our people, families,  neighbours and friends &mdash; are abused, physically and verbally, and intimidated  while they try to earn a living and provide a public service, and try to keep  the wolves from the door. The Assembly is saying with one voice that such abuse  is wrong.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Under its &lsquo;Freedom from Fear&rsquo; charter, the union produced a  10-point plan to a safer workplace. The plan is not rocket science, and that is  not a criticism of the union. We want the Department to embrace those points  and to develop a campaign similar to the positive and proactive campaign on  attacks on emergency and blue-light services. Although such attacks are still  happening, it has become socially unacceptable to attack the Fire Service, the  Ambulance Service and the PSNI. We need to make attacks on shopworkers socially  unacceptable.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Each of us has a part to play. The Chairperson did not  imply that any Member had been involved in direct confrontations with  shopworkers, but I am sure that if each of us looked into his or her  conscience, we would recollect incidents that we walked away from when we might  have challenged offensive behaviour or have played our part in resolving a  situation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Shop owners, big businesses and others have a part to play.  The Chairperson mentioned the recent tiger kidnapping. Similar issues arise in  mine and in other constituencies. They are happening across the board. Are we  making our shopworkers vulnerable? We will not look at other ways of protecting  them when money is being lifted from shops, for instance. I ask that we send  the 10-point plan to businesspeople and to the Federation of Small Businesses  (FSB) to try to get them to take forward those points.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Proof of age is a crucial issue. I checked it out the other  night. In fact, I was raging that I was not asked for ID. I asked a shopkeeper,  who was a young girl, whether she feels intimidated, and she said that she  does. Common sense should be used. We all know that alcohol cannot be bought at  all tills. Why are older people not put on the tills at which alcohol can be  sold rather than younger people who feel intimidated and under pressure in  those positions? Members will have seen mile-long queues for tills while other  tills lie empty. We need to put pressure on businesspeople.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Will the Member bring her remarks to a close?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  We all have our part to play, especially during the festive season. We cannot  have a murder picture in our shops. I appeal to people to be patient.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>:  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion. As a member of the Committee  for Employment and Learning, I warmly support the campaign that we are  discussing. It has generated considerable interest in the media.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The campaign, which has been successfully spearheaded by  the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers since 2002, seeks to prevent  violence, threats of violence and abuse against staff. That is a message that,  I am sure, all Members will support this morning.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When one thinks about a local convenience store, for  example, and the number of people who go through its doors daily, it soon  becomes clear that few jobs entail as much customer interaction as that of  shopworker. The employees in those shops are there to help customers and to  provide a service, and the least that they should expect is to be treated with  respect and decency. It is absolutely out of order for shop staff to have to  face any sort of abuse, verbal or physical. Such verbal abuse has been directed  at people who work in call centres as well.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Worryingly, in their presentation to the Committee, USDAW  officials revealed that abuse in Northern Ireland tended to be more  physical, whereas verbal abuse against shopworkers is more common in GB.  Regardless of how stressed or frustrated customers may be, it never gives them  the right to mistreat staff. If they break the trust between them, they deserve  to face the full force of the law. I ask the PSNI to take such abuse more  seriously than it may, perhaps, at present.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Staff are most at risk at night. I am sure that all Members  know of a local store that is open through the night, through its operation of  a 24-hour, open-door policy or through providing services through an opening in  the side of its building.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, when people are on their way home from a night  out and call into one of those stores, it is all too easy for the drink to kick  in and to give them a false sense of authority and, consequently, they abuse  the &mdash; often young, part-time &mdash; workers behind the till. Customers can also  become particularly agitated when asked for ID.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The aims of the USDAW Freedom from Fear campaign are  important for shopworkers, shopkeepers and shop customers. Take, for example,  one of the campaign&rsquo;s central aims. It promotes negotiations with employers to  improve the security of their stores. Apart from preventing crime, extra  security means extra protection for staff and customers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the fact that the Minister for Employment and  Learning is going to respond to the debate, as it was his Committee that moved  the motion in the first place. However, abuse against staff is not only a  Department for Employment and Learning (DEL) responsibility, if it is even in  that Department at all. It is much broader than that. It is an issue for the  Department of Justice (DJ) to make sure that there are enforceable penalties  for these sorts of crimes. It is also an issue for the Department of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI). Therefore, I trust that all those  Departments will consider the Freedom from Fear campaign.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will bring my remarks to a close by noting that violence,  threats and intimidation of any kind against shopworkers are absolutely  unacceptable. I commend USDAW for its campaign, and hope that the entire House  will be able to fully support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lyttle</strong>: I  support the motion and commend my colleagues on the Employment and Learning Committee  for bringing the issue to the Assembly. As my colleagues have said, it is one  of the more important motions that we have debated in the House in recent days.  Law and order is a foundation for any democratic society and a prerequisite for  economic development and investment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At the recent briefing by the Union of Shop, Distributive  and Allied Workers to the Employment and Learning Committee, I, too, was  concerned to learn about the extent of abuse faced by shopworkers. As a former  shopworker, I am proud to advocate on behalf of the sector and to call on the  Assembly to send out a clear message that such harassment will not be tolerated  in our society.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Shopworkers are the bedrock of our local economy, providing  access to a wide variety of goods and services on an almost 24/7 basis, with  adherence to the ethos that the customer is always right. I am glad to put my  party&rsquo;s recognition of the vital contribution that shopworkers play in our  community on the record today, and to call on the Executive to jointly consider  action to tackle shopworker abuse.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My colleagues have noted the USDAW survey which found that,  of 1,000 shopworkers, 10% were victims of violent attack and 70% suffered  verbal abuse. Those are simply unacceptable statistics. It is also unacceptable  to receive reports of young pregnant women being attacked in their place of  work, workers being kicked and spat on, and staff being kidnapped from the  sanctity of their own home simply because their employment is in the retail  sector. In my constituency, unfortunately, staff in a particular newsagent&rsquo;s  shop have been subjected to two attempted robberies in recent weeks. That type  of abuse leaves staff in fear and can have a serious impact on their health.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Today, we give voice to those hardworking members of our  community &mdash; young people starting out, mothers, fathers, older people, foreign  nationals and people working second jobs to make ends meet. We recognise the  service that they provide to our community and we support them in their calls  for the basic right of safety in the workplace. We give the support of the Assembly  to the Freedom from Fear campaign, which, since 2002, USDAW has taken forward  in the run-up to Christmas &mdash; which, as has been stated, is one of the busiest  and most challenging times of the year for our retail sector &mdash; to raise  awareness of the issue with members of the public and to clearly state that  shopworkers must be treated with dignity and respect.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As we have heard, of all the harassment that shopworkers  face, it is for refusing the sale of alcohol that the greatest abuse is  experienced. That ranges from verbal disrespect to physical violence and even  to workers&rsquo; homes being targeted for attack. There are not too many of us in  the House who need be too concerned about not looking older than 25, but I have  friends and acquaintances who, although aged over 18, have not, in the absence  of proof of age, been served alcohol. That is, at worst, inconvenient, and we  must note that shopworkers merely follow legal and employer obligation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In district policing partnerships and community safety fora  all over Northern Ireland,  we call on shopworkers to be the front line in the effort to prevent  alcohol-fuelled crime and antisocial behaviour. The Assembly and Executive  must, therefore, back up that request with support and action. We must work  with employers to deliver improved safety and security for shopworkers. We must  also consider more robust proof-of-age schemes, harsher penalties for those who  abuse staff and publicity to remind people that attempting to purchase alcohol  when under the age of 18 is a criminal offence.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps most important, however, is the need to support an  attitudinal change in how shopworkers are viewed by the public. The vast  majority of people in the community value and respect the service provided by  shopworkers. Indeed, we are famous for our marketplace interaction with one  another. The motion, however, in highlighting the seriousness of the harassment  and abuse that many shopworkers face, supports the Freedom from Fear campaign.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Bring your remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lyttle</strong>:  The motion calls on the Executive to take action against that abuse. I trust  that the Minister will convey the Assembly&rsquo;s united support for shopworkers &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lyttle</strong>: I  ask the Minister to consider what measures can be taken on this important  matter. I, too, support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Anderson</strong>:  I was pleased when the Committee for Employment and Learning unanimously  adopted the Freedom from Fear campaign. As a member of that Committee, I am  happy to support it. I applaud the efforts of the Union of Shop, Distributive  and Allied Workers to highlight the issue. I was shocked to learn of the high  level of threat to vulnerable shopworkers. Violence in the workplace is without  excuse and can never be acceptable. That sort of abuse is far too common. My  colleague Peter Weir gave us some facts on it this morning. The most recent  survey shows that one in four USDAW members is physically assaulted in his or  her place of work. It happens to civil servants who have regular contact with  the general public, and it happens to doctors and nurses when they are  confronted by violent patients in GP surgeries and in A&amp;E departments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion reminds us of other workers who deal with the  public day in and day out. It is clear that shopworkers suffer worryingly high  levels of assault. Shopworkers are employed in large department stores,  supermarkets, service stations and small corner shops. As has been said, such  jobs are often low paid, insecure and stressful. Employees often work long  hours, especially in the run-up to Christmas. I feel genuinely sorry for them.  As Christmas gets earlier and earlier, they have to endure that dreadful,  canned Christmas music that blares out in the shops and towns, probably from  the end of September. I would argue that that is an assault in itself. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: Is  there any truth in the rumour that the Member is auditioning for the part of  Scrooge in this year&rsquo;s pantomime?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Anderson</strong>:  Definitely not. I will leave that for the Member to attempt. My singing would  clear the Chamber.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Often, Christmas shopping is a stressful experience.  Stressed-out shopworkers deal with stressed-out shoppers, and that, in itself,  is a recipe for confrontation and conflict. Although we as consumers wish to  ensure that our rights are protected when we buy something, the fact is that  the customer is not always right.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic" align="center" style="text-align:center;">(Mr Deputy  Speaker [Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Very often, the abuse or even violence is about age-limited  products, such as DVDs, computer games, flammable materials, alcohol,  cigarettes or lottery tickets. Retail staff are obliged to check identification  if there is any doubt about the buyer&rsquo;s age. Such checks are not about  embarrassing the customer &mdash; retail workers will be disciplined if they fail to  carry them out &mdash; yet people get angry when asked for evidence of age or some  other form of ID. It has the potential to go from verbal abuse to violent  assault. Some members of the public go beyond verbal abuse. They can be  physically violent towards staff, and staff can face drunken shoppers,  aggressive shoplifters, gangs of youths on drugs and so on.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.00 noon</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If the problem is bad enough in big stores, it can be even  worse in service stations and corner shops. Such shops, which serve local  communities, can be easy prey for violent thieves. In recent times, shopkeepers  and their staff have been assaulted and killed in different parts of the United Kingdom.  Just a few weeks ago, a man died in an attempted robbery in a newsagent&rsquo;s in Cavendish Street in  west Belfast,  and the shop assistant was sprayed in the face.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I trust that the Minister will take note of the debate and  do all that he can to raise the profile of the issue and to pursue it with the  Executive. As David McClarty said, other Ministers, such as the Minister of  Justice, also have key roles to play. I appeal to the PSNI to ensure that there  is a strong police presence in town centres to control antisocial behaviour,  especially in the run-up to Christmas. Finally, I appeal to shop owners and  managers, who have a duty of care to their employees. Their staff have a right  to work in a safe and friendly environment and to be free from fear of  intimidation and violence. They must do all in their power to achieve that. I  support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I am a member of the Committee for  Employment and Learning, and I support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I might be coming at the issue from a slightly different  perspective from other contributors in this respect: when union representatives  came to brief the Committee, I was not as aware of the statistics and the scale  and frequency of incidents as I perhaps should have been. The briefing from the  union was a very good exercise in raising awareness, certainly for someone like  me.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I was listening to the media this morning; I happened to  catch it early. Mark Carruthers was interviewing, if I remember correctly,  Michala Lafferty on the BBC. Michala illustrated a particular scenario. She was  saying to the interviewer that, &ldquo;If this happens, well then &mdash; &rdquo;. I think that  she was about to say that the shopworker suffers as a result of the incident by  losing their job, when Mr Carruthers intervened to say that the shop, the  managers or whoever the employers are would suffer. It was certainly  insightful. We are not aware that it is the shop assistant who will suffer and  who could lose their job, and that example illustrated the point for me.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not see enough coming from employers in all of this,  and my party colleague Sue Ramsey referred to that. Employers are not proactive  enough. When the Committee was briefed, an example from 20 years ago was given.  The Committee Chairperson referred to a graphic example of a shopworker who  lost her baby as a result of violence and who was more or less told to get over  it. Therefore, examples from 20 years ago may be cited, and we have very  profitable multiples here now. I am not saying that some of the examples cited  to the Committee from 20 years ago arose directly from situations in big  profitable multiples. However, there is something wrong with the systems that  are in place to protect workers. Examples were cited around the Chamber today.  A worker goes to work and provides a service for the public. When people are  queuing in a shop, they have no idea that a shop attendant may feel under  threat. I am not saying that a worker would feel threatened by me; that would  not be the case. However, he or she may be under threat from people who are  unhappy with their place in the queue or with being asked for ID.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many agencies are involved in the issue, but it is  important that the message goes out from this debate that employers have work  to do. One recommendation in the Committee&rsquo;s documentation is that signs should  be put up around shops reminding shoppers that shop owners do not suffer if  workers are abused or threatened; only the shopworkers suffer. The Chairperson  said earlier that a culture of silence had grown and that many employers do not  want to draw attention to staff complaints. I repeat: that is unacceptable.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member please bring her remarks to a close?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  One union representative said that this all comes at great personal cost. I  support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  I support the motion. The Freedom from Fear campaign has been running for a  number of years across Britain  and in Northern Ireland.  USDAW is delighted at the approach taken by a united Assembly team in the  Committee for Employment and Learning. As I understand it, it is the first time  that that union has been represented in a more formal setting and received by  the Committee for Employment and Learning. As all Members who have spoken said,  the importance of the campaign, leading up to Christmas, is that it strives to  ensure that workers on whom we depend in all constituencies have freedom from  fear.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One of the biggest problems facing the trade union movement  and membership is getting in place assurance, proper protocols and conducts  that the employers&rsquo; body will take note of. One in four retail staff across Northern Ireland  has been a victim of some sort of abuse. It is a sad state of affairs for us  all that society does not treat those workers with the diligence, respect and  care that it is our duty to show.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Every year, thousands of retail workers are physically  assaulted, and hundreds of thousands are subjected to daily verbal abuse and  intimidation. Over half of the physical assaults are linked directly to  attempted shoplifting, and it is important that employers make staff fully  aware of what they should do regarding a suspected shoplifter. A policy should  make it clear that staff should not approach a suspected shoplifter or stop or  prevent shoplifting. I do not think that such guidelines are in place to  protect staff. In my constituency, we had a spate of armed robberies, and I  knew some of the shop staff who witnessed them. They took place in small corner  shops, perhaps with only one member of staff present. Other Members made that  point. Staff involved in such incidents are left traumatised. The distress and  anxiety caused will remain with them for a long time. Sue Ramsey raised the  point that a young woman working alone in a shop is vulnerable. It is very  difficult, particularly at night &mdash; we now have 24-hour shopping &mdash; to ensure  safety. The point was made in Committee by the Chairperson, I think, that it  must be ensured that all staff have an incident report book &mdash; not an accident  book or an injury book &mdash; so that employers know exactly where the risks and  hotspots are and can put staff in place appropriately and not leave them  exposed to difficulties in certain circumstances.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Other Members have raised this point, and the Minister has  taken the time to come along this morning, but this matter is not solely his  responsibility. One of the main and fundamental concerns that we have in the  Committee is police response times. Staff, who are vulnerable enough, are being  left, perhaps with someone fuelled with alcohol or drugs in the shop. They need  response times to be much more effective. The Health and Safety Executive also  needs to work not just with shop owners but with shoppers in order to protect  them. There must an ongoing review of procedures in those shops.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Another point that I wished to raise is about  age-restricted sales. One of the surveys carried out makes the dilemma facing  shop staff clear: more than 75% of staff have experienced problems related to  ID. In some cases, people refuse to give ID and become badly behaved and insulting  to staff. A total of 65% of staff have been subjected to verbal abuse; nobody  should be subjected to that. A certain decency should prevail, and shop staff  should be treated with respect. Some 16% have experienced threats of violence.  There should be zero tolerance towards violence. Some 2% of staff have been  physically assaulted at work, and 60% of those staff are worried that they may  be disciplined over actions they have taken as a result. Some 70% of those  staff are worried that they may face prosecution.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Bring your remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  This has been a good debate. I am delighted that the Minister will respond, but  joined-up government needs to be in place to ensure that we are giving  protection to staff.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I welcome the opportunity to respond to this  important motion. I thank the Member who brought it before the House, the  members of the Employment and Learning Committee and those who have made  contributions to the debate. As has been acknowledged, the Department for  Employment and Learning does not have an official remit with regard to abuse  against shopworkers, although I am happy to respond to the issues that have  been raised.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">USDAW&rsquo;s Freedom from Fear campaign is important and  considerable. Since it started in 2002, it has raised awareness of abuse of  shopworkers in any form. It is a particularly influential campaign that has  succeeded in getting major retailers to speak out and act against shopworker  abuse, and it has successfully lobbied politicians in Parliament and the  devolved legislatures to raise the problems with the relevant Departments. I  therefore pay tribute to the union on its campaign and support the motion  because I am very concerned about the high levels of abuse, threats and  violence of all kinds against shopworkers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I note the statistics used by Pat Ramsey in his press  release after the union&rsquo;s presentation to the Employment and Learning  Committee. It is entirely unacceptable that around 10% of workers represented  by that union have been the victim of violence, that almost 37% have been  threatened and that approximately 70% have been verbally abused. The British  Retail Consortium&rsquo;s crime survey of 2008 states that the overall level of  recorded incidents was calculated at 20 per 1,000 staff. Of course, behind the  statistics, there are always the individual cases. I want to refer to the  despicable attack on a shopworker on Sunday in my constituency in the area  around Tandragee, where a young lady was attacked and threatened. Such attacks  are disgraceful and despicable. Anyone who has any information should bring it  immediately to the PSNI to help ensure that those responsible are apprehended.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A 2003 survey of Northern Ireland shopworkers revealed  the following very disturbing experiences:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;One member was punched in the face for not taking  back an item that could not be proved was bought in the store as per company  policy. Two other colleagues were pushed and shoved for the same reasons.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">In another example, the person involved said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The off licence was closed. Two drunk men wanted  alcohol. While I was trying to explain, one of the men pulled out a hammer and  kept threatening me with it &hellip; he told me he was going to kill me with it.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">A third example occurred when:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Angry, aggressive customers tackled a colleague after  being over charged. There was shouting and name-calling and abuse. Angry  customers will vent their anger at the nearest available colleague.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">When all those cases are heard in such detail, they  are, frankly, unacceptable.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The abuse can take many forms, and shopworkers fear that it  can and will happen. If it does happen, it can, as we heard in the debate,  cause considerable health and emotional problems. According to the USDAW  &lsquo;Voices from the Frontline&rsquo; survey, almost 65% of Northern   Ireland&rsquo;s members, compared with less than 50% in the  rest of the United Kingdom,  have taken sick leave because of cases of abuse. Clearly, there is a problem to  be tackled. No one should have to face abuse at work. It is important,  therefore, that Members consider the policy responses to this issue carefully.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Given the union&rsquo;s presentation to the Committee for  Employment and Learning, it is clear that consideration needs to be given to  the criminal justice implications. We have to ask whether the sentences for the  abuse of shopworkers are sufficient and whether there is an appropriate  response from the relevant statutory agencies. Those issues are worthy of  consideration. There is also clearly a role for the PSNI to take attacks of  this nature seriously, and it may be an issue to raise with the PSNI to see  what guidelines it has in place for dealing with those crimes. In that context,  I pay tribute to members of the PSNI. If Members are serious about ending the  abuse of shopworkers, they will give continuing and unstinting support to the  PSNI and encourage full community support for the police.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Employers also have a major role to play. They are  responsible for the health and safety of their workers while they are on their  premises. The vast majority of retailers comply with their statutory duty of  care, but it may be that retailers can take other measures to enhance the  safety of their staff. Indeed, those issues were raised in the debate. There is  much to consider. I understand that many major retailers have endorsed the  Freedom from Fear campaign and have created a charter of respect for  shopworkers. Some of the major supermarkets display signs that ask customers to  respect staff. Perhaps that could be introduced in all shops. Therefore, there  are some non-statutory ways of raising awareness and helping to prevent abuse.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Shopworkers, at all times, play an important part in our  daily lives. They help to meet our basic needs by ensuring that food and  clothing are readily available. In the next few weeks, they will be even busier  as they deal with Christmas shoppers and, indeed, listen to piped Christmas  music. Nevertheless, the vast majority of customers are considerate and  respectful to shopworkers, and I strongly urge everyone to adopt that attitude.  I reiterate that any form of abuse of shopworkers is unacceptable. Suffering  abuse should never be part of that job.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I turn to Members&rsquo; contributions. Mrs Kelly made the  opening statement on behalf on the Committee, for which I thank her, and,  indeed, I thank the Committee for Employment and Learning for bringing forward  this important matter. Mr Weir, having confessed to the House that he had  bought dodgy goods in the past, sought to allege that I and, as I remember,  more than 70% of the people of Northern Ireland had also bought something  dodgy, namely the Belfast Agreement. It occurred to me that Mr Weir can, in  part, claim credit for having had a role in drafting and shaping the Belfast  Agreement, given that, at the time, he was one of the team known optimistically  as the baby barristers, who were under the guidance of the then leader of the  Ulster Unionist Party. It would appear that Mr Weir has enthusiastically  embraced the Belfast Agreement and, perhaps, helped to sell other dodgy  agreements, such as the St Andrews Agreement and the Hillsborough agreement.  However, we will leave it at that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank Sue Ramsey, who realises that the issue is not the  sole responsibility of my Department. Although other Departments have a role to  play, I assure her that I will bring these issues to the attention of Executive  colleagues in the hope that we can make progress. Mr McClarty highlighted the  importance of the PSNI&rsquo;s direct involvement. Chris Lyttle rightly said that  dignity and respect should be afforded to all shopworkers. Sydney Anderson is  clearly looking forward to Christmas, particularly to piped music in retail  shops. However, for all that, he made the important point that all shops, large  and small, are affected by the issues that we heard about, and, therefore, all  staff should be protected. Claire McGill also sought more protection for  workers, as did Pat Ramsey.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although my Department has no official remit for the issues  raised in the motion, given that it was moved by the Chairperson of the  Committee for Employment and Learning, I am happy to respond. I support the  motion, and I am happy to continue to provide support to this important cause.  I will, therefore, arrange for copies of the transcript of the debate to be  sent to the Minister of Justice and the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment. In  addition, I will, of course, be happy to try to assist the campaign in any way  that I can in conjunction with Assembly and Executive colleagues.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Employment and Learning (Mr Bell)</strong>: Today,  a clear message goes out from across the House. I know that we have had fun by  referring to other debates. However, the core message is that we will not allow  shop and retail staff to be treated as second-class citizens and that any form  of physical abuse, threatening behaviour or verbal abuse directed against them,  whether in a call centre or face to face, is unacceptable and will be treated  properly. In addition, we will insist that cases are dealt with by the  appropriate forces of law.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson of the Committee for Employment and  Learning outlined the need for a respect agenda, and she comprehensively and  intelligently put the case for why we should protect and support retail staff.  In her own fragrant style, Mrs Kelly also highlighted the need to produce proof  of identity when buying alcohol to be more properly considered in the debate.  How apt that message is, coming up to Christmas. Mr Weir told us that, at  times, Christmas can exacerbate the pressures on retail staff. I am convinced  that everyone, with one voice, whether they are from the east, west, north or  south or are republican, nationalist or unionist, will stand against those who  feel that it is acceptable to physically abuse one in 10 of our shop staff.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Sue Ramsey commended USDAW&rsquo;s 10-point plan, and I underline  the work to which she referred. This is not rocket science; it is something  that we should be doing every day. However, it is not being done, and Sue  Ramsey was right to highlight the need for the abuse of shopworkers to be  deemed socially unacceptable.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">David McClarty widened the debate to include call centre  staff and said that abuse of those workers is unacceptable. He made a critical  point about the need for joined-up government. The Department of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment should be involved along with the Department of Justice  and, potentially, the Department for Social Development because of the issues  surrounding the sale and consumption of alcohol. We, as a society, have strong  questions to ask ourselves when alcohol sold in supermarkets is cheaper than  bottled water. Are we not building up problems for our Health Service and our  families? People can buy mass-produced alcohol that is cheaper than water and drink  it at home, where there are no checks and balances by responsible publicans. Is  it any wonder that the police deal with a domestic violence incident every 21  minutes?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As a fellow shopworker, I sympathise with Chris Lyttle. I  have many happy memories of stacking shelves in Tesco in Connswater. On one  occasion when I was in the warehouse, the fork lift truck malfunctioned, and a  pallet of Del Monte orange juice cartons fell on top of a poor colleague of  mine who was standing next to me.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: Is  the Member sure that it was not a case of mistaken identity and that he was not  the intended target?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: As  shopworkers, we could have a laugh together. I laughed so hard that day that  the tears almost ran down my legs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Shopworkers stuck together, and I remember that, if someone  was sick, hurt or injured, we covered for them. We looked after one another.  There is a retail family that deserves protection. Shopworkers provide a  valuable service, and they need to know, as Sydney Anderson said, that they will  not be disciplined if they complain about being threatened or subjected to  verbal abuse and will not be told that such abuse is part of the job. They need  to know that a robust policy is in place to deal with such incidents.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Like Claire McGill, we have all heard about attacks. I  share with her the Committee&rsquo;s shock at the frequency of such attacks. USDAW is  to be congratulated on carrying out a survey of 1,000 staff, not in London but in Northern Ireland. That survey tells  us that 30% of those surveyed have experienced verbal abuse and 10% have been  physically assaulted for simply doing their job. I share with Claire the  understanding that some staff fear that they may lose their job. Where would we  be without those people? We need to highlight that, because they provide a  service. We have all run short of milk late at night and have run to the  garage. We have all gone to get loaves of bread for the children&rsquo;s lunches the  next day. Where would we be without people who work late at night, often on  their own?</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: What a parent.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: My  wife tells me that it is difficult.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Pat Ramsey outlined strongly the need for robust  guidelines, and I congratulate him on originally bringing the matter to the  attention of the Committee. He also highlighted the fact that staff can be  traumatised. It is not a victimless crime. A matter of weeks ago, I visited a  filling station in Ballygowan, where an incident had occurred when female staff  were closing up their tills. It looks as though they had been under observation  for a considerable period, and, as they closed the last till, somebody came  along, stuck a revolver into one girl&rsquo;s face and told her to clear her till. It  took only a matter of minutes, but &mdash; Mr Ramsey was absolutely correct &mdash; the  trauma that that girl suffered in Ballygowan will be with her for a lifetime.  She will always remember having a gun shoved into her face.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One thing impressed me. I had heard about the incident on  the news, and, when I was doing a constituency call in Ballygowan, I called  into the shop and asked the staff whether they were involved in the incident.  They said that they were. They were back at work the next morning. They had had  a gun in the face the previous night, but they had to open up to provide  business the next day. We salute all our shop staff who have suffered physical  violence and have been traumatised in the course of their work but get up the  next day and provide us all with a service. The House will unanimously back the  dedication and courage of those staff.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Ramsey was also absolutely correct to record the need  for those incidents not to be put down on the back of an envelope somewhere but  to be properly categorised and reported in a proper incident form so that we  can quantify and qualify the need for a response in those circumstances. The  Committee for Employment and Learning asked me, as a member of the Policing  Board, to raise with the police the need for them to treat robberies in shops  as priority incidents with other calls, to respond fully and to adequately  investigate such incidents at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister for spending the entire debate  listening to and, clearly, hearing what has been said. The most frequent  complaint that I hear from constituents about Departments is that they say that  an issue is not their responsibility or that they can only deal with one wee  bit and the person has to take the rest of the matter elsewhere. This is one  issue that allows a genuine attempt at joined-up government, and I appreciate  that the Minister is taking it seriously and looking at what DEL and the other Departments can do.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I fully endorse the Minister&rsquo;s call for the  police to be given full co-operation, which they get almost universally now. He  pointed out that recorded incidents affect 20 out of every 1000 staff. The  whole House will unite behind our shop staff, and some of us will go now to  stand with the shop staff. I congratulate the Committee, the Chairperson and  the House on their unanimous support for the motion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes with concern the high incidence of  abuse, threats and physical violence against shopworkers, which is likely to  increase in the run up to Christmas; pledges its support for the Freedom from  Fear campaign organised by the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers;  and calls on the Minister for Employment and Learning to pursue the issues  raised by the campaign with his Executive colleagues.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The next item of business on the Order Paper is Question Time. I  therefore propose, by leave of the Assembly, to suspend the sitting until 2.00  pm. The sitting will resume with Question Time at the new time of 2.00 pm.</p>

    <p class="OralAnswers-H2DepartmentHeading">Environment</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I remind the House of the changes to Standing Orders. Ministers have a time  limit, and I am conscious that Ministers had already prepared their briefs before  the House decided to change the Standing Orders, so I will allow some latitude  to Ministers. I will also allow some latitude to Members, provided that they do  not abuse it. I am conscious that those changes will kick in from next week in  a more serious way, but I hope that Members will be brief. Questions 7 and 8  have been withdrawn. One of the Members concerned has come to the Business  Committee and given the reason why they will not be in the House, and the other  Member has explained their reason to the Speaker&rsquo;s Office. That is the way that  business should done.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Flagpoles</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">1. <strong>Mr A  Maskey </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment how many planning applications  for flagpoles on ground owned by councils, the Housing Executive or the  Department for Regional Development, have been received and approved in the  last two years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 631/11<a name="AQO631/11" id="AQO631/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment (Mr Poots)</strong>: My Department has not received any planning  applications for flagpoles on council, Housing Executive or Department for  Regional Development (DRD) land in the past two years.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his response. Given the significant number of  flagpoles that are erected around the place, particularly on many arterial  routes, including some that are close to here, what does the Department intend  to do to have a number of those flagpoles, and, indeed, the flags that are on  them illegally, removed?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: For the purposes of planning legislation, a flag falls  within the definition of an advert. The display of certain adverts requires  express consent from the Department. However, the national flag can be  displayed without the need to obtain consent, and, where such is displayed in  accordance with the advertising regulations, the flagpole is deemed to have  planning permission and no application is required.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Has the Minister had any contact from the Minister for Regional Development  about the work of the flags working group, which was meant to have been  established last year on an interdepartmental basis to deal with the issue of  illegal flag flying?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: None that I am aware of.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Next on the list for a question is Mr Cathal Boylan.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Ceist uimhir a d&oacute;.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I am looking at the wrong Minister&rsquo;s questions. It is Mickey Brady next.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Heritage Sites: Safety</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">2. <strong>Mr  Brady </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment how much the Northern Ireland  Environment Agency has spent over the last three years on safety measures at  heritage sites under its control.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  632/11<a name="AQO632/11" id="AQO632/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: I  am not sure how the Speaker could make that mistake. I will forgive you this  time. I got my hair cut recently.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: In the past three financial years, the Northern Ireland  Environment Agency (NIEA) has spent a total of &pound;1,208,446 on safety measures at  heritage sites under its control. In 2007-08, &pound;345,204 was spent; in 2008-09,  &pound;443,644 was spent; and, in 2009-2010, &pound;419,598 was spent. In the current  financial year, 2010-11, the NIEA has spent a further &pound;293,308 to date on  safety measures.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his answer. Will he seek to ensure that the NIEA takes  appropriate action to provide adequate safety measures concerning access to the  adjacent quarry at the Navan Fort site in Armagh?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I ask the Member to write to me on that issue, and I will  have the matter investigated. If there are any safety issues, we will address  them.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  note the importance of the health and safety issue. Have there been  compensation claims, and, if so, how much has been paid out in recent times in  compensation and legal costs?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: In 2007-08, &pound;19,375 was paid out; in 2008-09, nothing was paid  out; and, in 2009-2010, &pound;7,326 was paid out.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Local Government: Recycling</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">3. <strong>Mr  Storey </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment to outline what action his  Department will take against councils that do not meet their recycling targets.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 633/11<a name="AQO633/11" id="AQO633/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The primary mechanism for ensuring performance in waste  management is the Northern Ireland Landfill Allowance Scheme (NILAS). Although  it focuses on reducing landfill with biodegradable waste, it also has the  effect of encouraging higher recycling rates. Recycling targets apply to Northern Ireland  as a whole but do not apply at council level. With the household recycling rate  in 2008-09 standing at 34&middot;4%, Northern    Ireland is on track to meet the waste  management strategy recycling target of 35% by 2010.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am committed to assisting local councils in their efforts  to boost recycling rates, and I am pleased to advise that my Department is  implementing a range of interventions to meet the targets. That includes over  &pound;5 million capital funding for local councils in this financial year through  the Rethink Waste capital fund; &pound;1 million of annual funding for the waste and  resources action programme; &pound;240,000 for the Rethink Waste revenue fund; and  the provision of guidance and advice to local councils on their  responsibilities under NILAS.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those initiatives, together with delivery of the strategic  waste infrastructure programme, will clearly help councils and others to meet  forthcoming EU recycling targets and EU obligations on landfill diversion.  Although it is likely that all those measures will encourage further increases  in recycling rates, I will continue to consider all options to ensure that  those improvements continue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his answer. He highlighted that, although Northern Ireland  is on target to meet the 35% household recycling target, there is an obvious  issue with councils&rsquo; varying success in achieving that target. Will the  Minister indicate why there has been such a variation? Will he ensure that  small councils such as Ballymoney Borough Council, which I represent and which  is the second smallest council, and Moyle District Council, which is the  smallest council, are given all the support that they need, given the current  issue with the capital grant?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. I believe that,  regardless of whether councils meet that target, a lot of it comes down to the  council leadership. Banbridge District Council and Antrim Borough Council are  achieving rates of 48&middot;3% and 47&middot;9% respectively. Magherafelt District Council,  which I visited last week, will have achieved a rate of 50% this year and is  looking to achieve a rate of 80% within the next two years. Therefore, if the  target can be met in small councils, there is no reason why other councils  cannot meet it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The councils that are not performing as well as others and  that are well below the 35% target include Strabane District Council, with a  rate of 25&middot;7%; Belfast City Council, with a rate of 26&middot;3%; and Fermanagh District  Council, with a rate of 26&middot;7%. Those councils need to reflect on where they  are, on their contribution to recycling and on the impact that it will have on  Northern Ireland as a whole if they do not step up to the mark and meet future  targets. Other councils will carry them over the line for the 2013 model.  However, if they continue to lag behind for the 2020 model, they could cost Northern Ireland  a considerable amount of money.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  Will the Minister give his assessment of the number of councils across Northern Ireland  that, first, have the capacity to provide services for recycling food waste,  and secondly, are currently providing that service?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I know that a considerable number of councils are  providing that service, but I am not sure whether they are all doing it at this  moment in time. However, there is no particular reason why they cannot do it. A  considerable number of facilities that recycle food waste are now in place.  Such waste is one of the largest generators of methane, which is a particularly  damaging gas. Therefore, if councils are not providing that service, I implore  them to get on with it and to sign the necessary deals and partnerships with  the private sector to ensure that the public sector does not lose out as a  result of procrastination.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I  welcome the incentives that are available to encourage councils to meet the  recycling target. Will the Minister tell us what plans he has to monitor the  various councils&rsquo; targets so that we do not end up in the embarrassing position  where ratepayers may be penalised for the failure of some councils to meet  those targets?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: As regards the potential for councils to face fines, under  the NILAS regulations, an essential element of my Department&rsquo;s strategy is to  meet the obligations of the EU landfill directive. If there were substantial  slippage in that infrastructure programme, any fine accruing to the United Kingdom as a whole because of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s non-compliance would be  deducted from the Northern    Ireland block. That fine would then be  passed on to the councils in the defaulting waste management groups. Obviously,  if particular councils in a group are not performing as part of the waste  management group system, all the councils in that group could be hit with a  fine. It is, therefore, important that those waste management groups are the  driving force in ensuring that those targets are met, otherwise a taxation  burden, from which no benefits can be derived, will be placed on the public.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Planning: Replacement Dwellings</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">4. <strong>Mr K  Robinson </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment for his assessment of the  number of planning applications granted for replacement dwellings since the  introduction of PPS 21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  634/11<a name="AQO634/11" id="AQO634/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Since the introduction of the finalised version of  Planning Policy Statement 21 (PPS 21) on 1 June 2010, my Department has granted  97 applications for replacement dwellings in rural areas. Those figures are  extracted from my Department&rsquo;s first quarterly statistical bulletin for  development management, which only provides data up to 30 June. Due to the new  statistical code of practice, it is not possible to provide information on any  applications that have not been through the quality assurance process prior to  publication of official statistics. The next development management quarterly  statistics are due for publication on 9 December.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer. Is the Minister satisfied with the  controls that ensure that, when an application for a replacement dwelling is  granted, the style of the building and the materials used reflect the  vernacular style of the district in a sympathetic way, rather than allowing  haciendas to appear all over the place?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: There are two elements to that. First, there is  eligibility for replacement. If a dwelling is eligible for replacement, it  should happen. Secondly, there are design issues, and planning officers should  ensure that the design of a dwelling does not run contrary to what should be in  the countryside. We are in the process of developing a design guide, which will  assist architects and the Planning Service when arriving at those decisions. In  the interim, if there are issues that the Member or members of the public feel  to be incongruous to development in the countryside, those concerns should be  raised through the local government sector and the councils. That will ensure  that those voices are heard, and that site or office meetings are called in  those instances.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. I am glad that you clarified the distinction between  Mickey Brady and me; he looks a bit different with his long hair. Will the  Minister give a commitment to the House that PPS 21 will be properly and  consistently rolled out across all divisions? It is being interpreted  differently in different parts of the North, and I want an assurance from the  Minister today that it will be properly interpreted across the North.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: On the back of the meeting that we had with the  Environment Committee, the chief executive of the Planning Service will meet  the divisional planning managers to discuss those issues. To be quite honest,  there are far too many issues being raised with me on the interpretation of PPS  21 due to the lack of consistency across the offices. The chief executive of  the Planning Service will meet the divisional planning managers to ensure that  there is a greater consistency of approach to those applications.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answers so far. He will be aware that, like the  Member who asked the last question, I have raised the issue of inconsistency  across divisions in the past. Will the Minister inform the House and the people  of Northern Ireland  what he believes &ldquo;substantially intact&rdquo; means in respect of replacement  dwellings?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: &ldquo;Substantial&rdquo; means &ldquo;a significant amount&rdquo;. It should not  be a collection of stones that once formed a dwelling but have been allowed to  tumble down. We are looking for the exterior walls to be &ldquo;substantially  intact,&rdquo; which may involve peaks of gable walls being lost or someone widening  the access to the building to allow a vehicle to be parked in it. Those things  would not necessarily affect the integrity of its replacement value. However,  we do not want disused buildings dotted across the countryside; it would be  better to have appropriately designed buildings to replace them. That is the  context in which the Planning Service should address the issue: can we improve  our countryside and offer people the opportunity to live in a rural community  without causing further detriment to that community? That is where we wish to  go as an elected body, that is where I wish the Planning Service to go, and  that is the message that it will be getting from its chief executive.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his answer.  Will he advise what measures the Department and the Planning Service have taken  to ensure consistent application of planning policy statement 21 across the  North?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: We have talked about consistency throughout. I recognise that  it is a new policy and that not every planning officer may interpret it in  exactly the same way. We proposed the meeting to ensure a more consistent  interpretation of planning policy.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Coastal Planning</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">5. <strong>Mr D  Bradley </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment when he intends to address  issues relating to coastal planning.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  635/11<a name="AQO635/11" id="AQO635/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Development plans extend to the low watermark taking in  the coastal area. In addition, my Department is committed to having an  integrated marine plan for Northern    Ireland in place by 2014, which will also  address issues relating to the coast.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I call David McClarty &mdash; sorry, Dominic Bradley.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Sh&iacute;l m&eacute; go raibh t&uacute; ag gabh&aacute;il  tharam ansin ar feadh bomaite. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as an fhreagra a  thug s&eacute;. Does the Minister agree that PPS 16 missed the opportunity to address  the issue, introduce proposals to create balanced communities and prevent the  erosion of indigenous populations in coastal areas? How does he intend to deal  with the issue?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: PPS 16 is a policy document that is out for consultation.  If the Member thinks that opportunities have been missed, he can put his  responses in, and they will be given due consideration.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  The Minister will be aware of the problem of unwanted apartment developments,  particularly second-home developments, along the north coast. Will he outline  the protection that the various pieces of legislation will provide on that  issue, which is prevalent not only on the north coast but on other coastal  areas around Northern    Ireland?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Much of that is dealt with through the development plan  process. The northern area plan, which covers an area for which the Member is a  representative, will go to the Planning Appeals Commission for its  consideration. The Planning Service will make its decisions thereafter. A  consultation process of public inquiry will go through the Planning Appeals  Commission, and the public will have their say. Influential members of the  community, such as the Member of Parliament for East   Londonderry, will be able to make the sort of case that he spoke  of today.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>:  I have an intense feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, having been on my feet before. Will the  Minister advise whether there are any live applications for offshore wind farms  on the north coast?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: There have been enquiries about offshore wind farms,  although I am not sure whether there are any live applications. I take it that  the Member refers to a proposal that was made some time ago for an offshore  wind farm just across from Portstewart. All those things will be read against  prevailing planning policy. Wind farms sometimes come into conflict with  natural heritage; at the same time, we are trying to drive forward renewable  energy in Northern Ireland.  The Executive have set us a target of 40% by 2020. There are tremendous  opportunities to produce considerable amounts of renewable energy, not just  offshore wind energy but tidal energy. It will all be viewed against prevailing  policies.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  The Minister will know that I am passionate about saving our coastline. The  last two questions related to the north coast. Will the Minister advise the  House whether he will also do his bit to preserve, as far as possible, the Irish Sea coast and, in particular, Strangford Lough,  which is an area of outstanding natural beauty in every sense?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The planning policies that are established apply to all of  Northern Ireland  rather than any one particular area. The development plans get into the details  of particular areas and seek to identify the needs of the people in those areas  and to provide for those needs without causing fundamental damage to other key  elements of our built-in natural heritage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have the new &lsquo;Ards Down Area Plan 2015&rsquo;, which was  brought about over the past few years. That is the main document for assessing  planning applications in conjunction with the planning policy statements in the  area.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Raymond McCartney is not in his place for question 6. As I have already indicated,  questions 7 and 8 have been withdrawn.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Goods Vehicle Licensing</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">9. <strong>Mr  Callaghan </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment when the Goods Vehicles  (Licensing of Operators) Act (Northern    Ireland) 2010 will be implemented.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 639/11<a name="AQO639/11" id="AQO639/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) Act (Northern Ireland)  2010 became law on 22 January 2010. A programme plan was developed on the basis  of a two-year implementation period. An implementation team has been in place  since April 2010, and there is no delay in the programme. It is expected that  the Act will be operational by early 2012.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  What assurances can the Minister give us that the processing of licence  applications will remain in Northern Ireland  and will not be centralised in Wales  or elsewhere?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: That is one of the challenging issues when it comes to  financial arrangements. We probably have to identify a considerable new  computer system. If that system is adopted, it will be at very significant  cost. There may be opportunities to do that in conjunction with the private  sector to keep the processing of licence applications in Northern Ireland.  That could be done at a lower cost in Wales, because the system is  already in place there. However, the consequence of doing that would be jobs  lost to Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">None of those issues will be dealt with lightly, nor will  they be dealt with without proper and adequate consultation. At this moment,  there is no proposal to transfer any of those jobs out of Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Planning Policy Statement 4</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">10. <strong>Mr  Moutray </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment to outline the benefits that  the revised PPS 4 will have for the business community.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 640/11<a name="AQO640/11" id="AQO640/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Revised PPS 4 will help to achieve a modern vibrant  economy, provide certainty and give clarity to businesses, and that should  result in faster and better planning decisions. PPS 4 provides up-to-date  policy to meet the needs of a modern economy, including IT and research and  development. It also includes regional policy for offices, storage and  distribution and provides flexibility for economic development in rural areas.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Moutray</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer. Will he indicate what the policy&rsquo;s impact  will be for rural areas?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Revised PPS 4 has a positive approach to development in  the countryside and complements PPS 21 by introducing a degree of flexibility  for businesses in rural areas. It contains policies on expansion and  redevelopment of established economic development uses, major industrial  development and small rural projects. Planning Service has approximately 200  applications that are related to commercial and industrial uses. The final  publication of PPS 4 may have an impact and allow a number of those  applications in rural constituencies to move towards approval.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Road Safety: Christmas</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">11. <strong>Mr  Boylan </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment what additional measures his  Department intends to implement over the Christmas and new year period to  ensure maximum safety for road users.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  641/11<a name="AQO641/11" id="AQO641/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I apologise, Mr Speaker; this is a long answer. The launch  of the PSNI Christmas anti-drink-driving operation took place on Friday 26  November 2010 and will be supported by the Department. The Christmas and new  year anti-drink-driving television campaign, Hit Home, will commence on 1  December 2010 and will continue throughout the Christmas and new year period and  will end early in January 2010. The campaign will consist of a 30-second TV  advertisement; washroom posters; glowboxes displayed in pubs, clubs and  restaurants throughout Northern Ireland; and online activity carrying the  &ldquo;Never Ever Drink and Drive&rdquo; strapline.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Several special buys of the hard-hitting Shame campaign,  originally launched in 2000, will air throughout December. The campaign will  consist of a 60-second TV advertisement and will carry the strapline:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Could You Live With The Shame?&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department&rsquo;s anti-drug-driving campaign, Steps, will be  on air during the traditional Christmas party calendar from mid-November to the  new year. That campaign seeks to raise awareness of the drug-driving problem  and to highlight the ultimate consequences of driving under the influence of  drugs and carries the strapline:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;What steps will you take to stop a drug driver from  wrecking your life?&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This will be the third year of the &lsquo;Gift&rsquo; radio campaign,  consisting of a portfolio of five radio edits. The campaign will run throughout  December, targeting all road users with a mix of key road safety messages that  focus on the Christmas period. Department of the Environment (DOE) road safety  interventions will appear on many Internet sites over the Christmas and new year  period. Digital warnings from our extensive online portfolio will address many  problem road-user behaviours using display and search engine marketing  techniques where the audience least expects it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This is the fourth year of the Coca-Cola designated driver  initiative, launching on 30 November. Once again, the Department and the PSNI  will be supporting the initiative. The scheme, which will be operational in  many venues across Northern    Ireland, offers three free soft drinks to  designated drivers during the festive season.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My Department and the Road Safety Authority in the Republic of Ireland intend to issue a joint appeal  on road safety, with particular focus on the border areas in the run-up to  Christmas. Mutual support can be particularly effective in the North/South  context because of similarities in the road safety record and the common cause  of fatalities and serious injuries.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This year, the Ulster GAA and Young Farmers&rsquo; Clubs of  Ulster will support the DOE and help to deliver the road safety message to the  most vulnerable on our roads: young people in rural areas, particularly young  males, around the Christmas and new year period.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During road safety week, 22 to 28 November, a series of  events supporting the DOE as well as the PSNI, the Northern Ireland Fire and  Rescue Service, Brake UK and others, raised awareness of how dangerous our  roads are. That is timely, as many of us are preparing for the Christmas  period, and we are taking the opportunity to urge caution on all road users at  this busy time.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>: I  was going to get Mickey Brady to ask the supplementary question for me. That  was a very detailed answer but the Minister highlighted the issue along the  border, and more co-operation between the PSNI and the Garda. Does he intend to  put more resources into that area because, as he is aware, most of the  fatalities and accidents occur in and around rural border roads?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I met the police and strongly encouraged them to pay more  attention to the south and west of the Province, because that was where the  most road deaths were taking place. Therefore, it is imperative for us to seek  to ensure that people&rsquo;s lives are protected, because very often those who are  killed on the roads are innocent parties, not the people who are breaking the  law. We really need to ensure that people can travel safely on our roads.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that the major area of loss of life and serious injury  is on rural roads? Will he join me in encouraging the police to target not  necessarily only areas where they can easily catch speeders, but to set  specific targets for the rural roads on which deaths and serious injuries are  occurring?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Sophisticated targeting of areas where deaths and injuries  are taking place is key to moving things forward. It is not always best policy  to engage in areas where it is easy to catch someone speeding but where it does  not have a particularly significant consequence, or where a road does not have  a significant traffic accident history. That is a matter for the PSNI, but we  should concentrate on areas with the highest number of road deaths.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Planning Applications</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">12. <strong>Mr  Lyttle </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment what action his Department is  taking to clear the current backlog of planning applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 642/11<a name="AQO642/11" id="AQO642/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The Member may be aware of the action plan that is in  place to deal with the PPS 14/21 applications that were at deferral stage prior  to the publication of the final version of PPS 21 on 1 June 2010.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A time frame of six months for the reassessment of those  backlog applications was agreed, which expires on 1 December. As agreed,  divisional planning offices are continuing to reassess those applications in  accordance with the time frame outlined. Of the other backlog applications, I  agreed with my officials that we shall initially concentrate on determining the  major category of planning applications that have been in the system for more  than 12 months. As a result, my Department agreed divisional action plans for  the 2010-11 business year, with a view to reducing the backlog of major  applications that exceed 12 months in the system.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lyttle</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his response. How have staff reduction and relocation in  the Planning Service impacted on the backlog?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Staff reduction and relocation were done out of necessity,  not desire. That will not have had a positive impact on dealing with the  backlog of planning applications. However, we are, or have been, dealing with  more planning applications. Therefore, the backlog has been reduced.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  Is the Minister prepared to consider extending the time for businesses that  have submitted a planning application but, because of the economic downturn,  are unable to proceed with their development at this time?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: That matter was part of the consultation on the planning  Bill, and I am sure that the Committee will also consider it. People whose  background is in the community or in residents&rsquo; groups would prefer that time  to be shortened, but people from a business background would prefer it to be  lengthened. The identification of the best way to proceed is the conundrum that  we will always face. Therefore, we do not propose to extend or to reduce the  length of time. That can be done through the planning reform Bill, which I hope  to bring to the Assembly in the near future.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H2DepartmentHeading"><a name="f"></a>Finance and Personnel</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I advise the House that question 11 has been withdrawn.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Government: Revenue</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">1. <strong>Mr A  Maskey </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel whether any steps have  been taken by his Department to identify ways to raise revenue through renting  or selling properties within the Civil Service estate. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 645/11<a name="AQO645/11" id="AQO645/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel &nbsp;(Mr S Wilson)</strong>:  I can speak only of the property that is owned and leased by the Department of  Finance and Personnel (DFP), namely the government office estate. That  comprises approximately 200 buildings, with a total asset value of &pound;300  million. Properties division has a three-year accommodation plan, which is  focused on generating savings through either improving the utilisation of the  space within the estate or generating capital receipts from the sale of surplus  assets. So far, through reducing the amount of space that we lease, we have  generated annual savings of &pound;1&middot;68 million over the past two years. Over the  next three years, savings of &pound;2&middot;85 million are anticipated through the vacation  of further buildings. In addition, when sites were declared surplus to  requirements, our sale of buildings released capital of &pound;2&middot;2 million, and we  look forward to selling two further sites.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. I thank the Minister for his response. If the Minister&rsquo;s  figures related only to DFP, it would be a serious indicator of the overall  amount of money involved in rent and rates for government buildings.  Nevertheless, and perhaps even because of that, has the Minister requested or  received any update on the costs that might be saved through the  decentralisation of Departments or their associated offices and agencies?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The cost of decentralisation was not an issue of  savings. The cost of decentralisation was estimated at &pound;40 million, which is  one reason why it has not proceeded. The real savings are to be found in  looking at the office space that is required and trying to use it more  intensively, looking at where we overuse space, terminating or not renewing  leases that are coming to an end, and bringing people together in fewer  offices. That kind of approach will bring savings in the future. As I said,  over the next three years, we intend to make savings of about &pound;2&middot;87 million on  the Northern Ireland Civil Service office estate.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I heard the Minister say that the current value of the estate is &pound;300 million.  Does the estate have an income-generating potential for us?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Indeed it does. One way that we could release some  money is through the sale and leaseback of part of our estate. That has added  benefits. If we needed to improve buildings, they could be sold, improved and  leased back. That would immediately release capital, because we would get the  capital value of the buildings.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, the longer-run impact of that would, of course, be  the cost stream from paying rent over the years. At present, the problem, which  we are looking at actively with regard to certain projects, is that, because of  the state of the market and the rate of return that people would require, we  would probably either get a lower price for the offices that we sell or have to  pay a higher rent. There would be consequences for the future.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  My question is in a similar vein. Rather than asking the Minister what he might  or will do, I want to know what has been done since the collapse of Workplace  2010 to realise the two aims of that project: to raise revenue and to improve  the quality of the estate as a workspace for staff.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: As the Member knows, Workplace 2010 envisaged  putting about 70% of the estate up for sale, leasing it back and releasing  capital assets from that. Due to market conditions, that did not progress. We  are working with the Strategic Investment Board and with the central assets  realisation team to compile a list of all the properties and land under each  Department&rsquo;s control in order to finalise the assets that we hold, determine  their potential and realise sale or lease-back opportunities, or, indeed, sale  of assets. I was surprised to find that no such list existed.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McHugh</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I refer to the Minister&rsquo;s last point.  It is a bad time to sell part of the estate. However, the running costs of  places such as Loughery College and Greenmount College  and the upkeep of vast swathes of land must greatly affect revenue. The same  could be said of any other property. It is a bad time to sell. Nevertheless,  sale should be considered.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: It is easy for Members to stand up in the Assembly  to say that although it is a bad time to sell, selling should be considered.  Although it might seem a sensible approach to release money for some capital  pet projects that people want to be dealt with, it might look different in  three or four years&rsquo; time, when the Public Accounts Committee and the Audit  Office ask why a valuable asset was given away.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have said time and time again that it is important that  Ministers and Departments be held to account for their decisions. However,  sometimes, with the best will in the world, a decision is made that, with  hindsight, might not look like a great decision. Of course, the louder the  demand for scalps for decisions that were made for the best reasons in the  past, the more cautious people become when making the kind of bold decisions  that the Member suggested.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Comprehensive Spending Review 2010</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">2. <strong>Mr  Boylan </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel when he expects to be  updated by HM Treasury on the impact of the comprehensive spending review on  our economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 646/11<a name="AQO646/11" id="AQO646/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I do not expect Her Majesty&rsquo;s Treasury to undertake  any analysis of the impact of the spending review on Northern Ireland. The spending  review was announced on 20 October 2010. The amount of money that came to Northern Ireland  was the amount that the Treasury believed that it was entitled to under the  Barnett formula. It is now up to the Northern Ireland Executive to decide how  they apportion that Budget among Departments. Hopefully, we will do so soon. I  expect Her Majesty&rsquo;s Treasury to issue the paper on rebalancing the economy,  which it has promised. I intend to continue to press it for delivery of that  paper as soon as possible.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. When will the Assembly see that paper?  Members need all the relevant information before we can discuss the Budget and  address it properly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Let me disabuse Members of any idea that we can  delay the Budget until we receive the Treasury paper. If that were the case,  and since we anticipate that we will not have the paper until late December or  early in the new year, we simply would not have a Budget for Northern Ireland.  Furthermore, the initial paper is likely to be a discussion paper. It is  important for us to decide our Budget on the basis of the revenue and the money  that we know is available to us.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>:  Should the Executive fail to reach agreement on the Budget, will the Minister  elaborate on the impact of that on our economy?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I think that I have indicated the impact, time and  time again. The current uncertainty is causing great distress among those who  rely on budget allocations from the Executive. Only this morning, I heard  someone from the Children&rsquo;s Hospice talking about the impact that the lack of  knowledge about what is happening next year and the following years is having  on the work of the hospice. Many voluntary and community groups are wondering  whether they should put people on protective notice, because they do not know  what their budget will be for next year. A number of Ministers have told me  that they need certainty so that they can discuss what spending will be  available with trusts, boards and units in their Departments. Those are the  practical difficulties.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is also the political reality. If we do not get the  Budget sorted out, people will take a view on the Assembly&rsquo;s effectiveness on  the issue. I do not want to play up negative aspects. I hope that all members  of the Executive and all parties of the Assembly will adopt a responsible  attitude so that we can establish a Budget quickly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. What steps does the Minister think  should be taken in the new Budget to deliver better on the priority to grow the  regional economy?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I am glad that the Member asked that question. That  involves a number of issues, which is why discussion on, and quick  establishment of, the Budget is so important. The Budget must not be a  last-minute, knee-jerk reaction to a crisis that we have allowed to develop. It  has to be strategic, and we must take a strategic view on it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">First, although our capital allocation has been greatly  reduced, we must look at the infrastructure projects that most effectively make  Northern Ireland  a better place for businesses. Those projects might be on the road network, the  telecommunications networks or the ports. They are the types of project that  will help us to deliver goods and services not only in Northern Ireland  but in the export market to the wider world.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, we must ensure that sufficient money is set aside  to capitalise on the good work that the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment is doing in seeking opportunities for inward investment. On the  basis of the information that she has given to me, the pipeline of enquiries  has never been fuller. Over the past year, per head of population in Northern Ireland,  we delivered as many jobs as were delivered in the Republic, even without the  reduced rate of corporation tax. We must ensure that enough money is put into  the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment budget to maintain that  momentum.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Thirdly, given that our skilled workforce is one of our big  selling points, the Department for Employment and Learning budget is important  for maintaining training and the proper skills base, anticipating the skills  that will be needed and preparing people for those jobs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Another factor has been mentioned, which is that we must  try to get the Government at Westminster  to deliver some additional levers to us that will help to attract inward  investment.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  Has the Minister advised his ministerial colleagues, when they make their cuts,  to consider the net impact of those cuts? For instance, will the Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure&rsquo;s cut to the North West  200 funding lead to an even greater loss of tourism revenue to the Northern Ireland  economy?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Finance  and Personnel</strong>: The savings plans of Departments are up to individual  Ministers. One reason why I gave early warning of the likely Budget pressures  in June was to give Ministers time to consider what savings plans they might  put in place, how those savings might impact and how they might affect some  important areas such as tourism and industrial promotion, which have to be  addressed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am very disappointed that many Ministers have not even  produced savings plans. Some have actually taken their savings plans to their  Committees already, whereas others have not even produced them or I have not  seen them, which is disappointing.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that all Ministers, when considering what savings to  implement, will consider their impact. I have said to them time and time again  that if they are going to reduce, they should reduce the level of bureaucracy  in their Departments, make sure that they are delivering services in the most  efficient way and cutting down on administration. They should look to see whether  there are ways of carrying out the same delivery more effectively, perhaps by  using the social sector. Ministers should always be aware that some savings  will have greater impact than others, and the Member has given an example for  the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: Will  the Minister assure the House that he will advise all the other Ministers not  to see the voluntary sector as an easy target for cutting the budget for front  line services?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I am glad that the Member asked that question,  because I have had many meetings with the voluntary and social sector. Rather  than seeing it as a burden on the Executive&rsquo;s Budget, much of the sector&rsquo;s work  should be seen as an opportunity for more effective and innovative delivery of  services. I am sure there will always be the tendency for Ministers to keep  things in their Departments; they are the things closest to Ministers, and of  which those who advise Ministers have most knowledge. However, I hope that  Ministers will look seriously at the services and opportunities in the  voluntary sector, especially preventative areas. They should make sure that  they make full use of the sector&rsquo;s expertise and efficiencies.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have been impressed by the voluntary and social sector,  which is well ahead of the game in making its services more cost-effective by  looking at mergers and changes. In doing so, organisations in that sector place  themselves well to make bids for parts of the Budget.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Government: Revenue</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">3. <strong>Mr  Leonard </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel to outline any  engagements his Department has had with independent economic advisers regarding  new ways in which the Executive could raise revenue.&nbsp; (AQO 647/11<a name="AQO647/11" id="AQO647/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: My Department has not met any independent economic  advisers to discuss how the Executive could raise new revenue. However, we have  done two things. As part of the Budget review group, we have asked all  Departments to come up with suggestions as to how revenue might be raised in  their Departments. Somebody very courteously leaked that paper to one of the  local newspapers, so there is a whole list of those things in the public domain  already. I am not sure who did it, but someone felt that the public should have  full sight of it. I have also met the Confederation of British Industry, the Institute of Directors, and the Chamber of Commerce,  among others, to discuss where they see the potential for raising revenue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Leonard</strong>:  I thank the Minister for that answer, although it was slightly disappointing.  However, will the Minister further assure us that if there are genuine ideas  for raising money here, he will seek assurances that that money will not be  lost in Westminster&rsquo;s coffers and that the region will be better off in net terms?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The Member makes a very good point. We could do  things to raise money, but, because of Treasury rules, the money raised would  simply come off the block grant. We have to be inventive by looking at ways in  which we can raise money so that it stays in Northern Ireland. There is no point  in imposing the pain of raising revenue simply to find that it comes off the  block grant. I hope that Ministers and Departments will be inventive on that.  However, when we try to raise money by charging more for services, there will  be some pullback from those affected and there will be complaints that they do  not want to pay more for services.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  Will the Minister indicate whether he believes that raising additional tax, in whatever  form it might take, could take more money out of the economy and out of  circulation, delay recovery and, perhaps, even cause more job losses? Could it  potentially cause the tax revenue possibilities to be lost?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The Member makes a very good point. It is for that  very reason that I would prefer us to address budget pressures by looking for  efficiencies, and that we should be dipping our hands into other people&rsquo;s  pockets only when we have exhausted other possibilities or are satisfied that  we have achieved as much efficiency as possible. I prefer that people spend  their own money rather than us taking it and spending it for them. However,  there are certain services that people want, value and continually indicate that  they want the Executive to provide. It would be irresponsible of us to say that  those services can be provided for nothing. If they are valued by the  community, they have to be paid for in some way. However, raising revenue  should not be the option of first resort. It should be the option of last  resort.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Such is the scale of the challenge that we have to look at savings and at  revenue raising. Will the Minister explain to the House why the Executive seem  determined to look at almost every conceivable revenue-raising option apart  from the most obvious one, which is water charging. That is the biggest  distortion when one looks at household expenditure here compared with that in  the rest of the UK.  It has been supported by a large number of economists and business leaders, and  it can be progressive.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I admire the Member&rsquo;s persistence on this issue.  Even though his party appears to be wandering away from him on it, at least he  is consistent. I think that he knows the answer to the question, which is that  a number of parties in the Executive feel that they have made a commitment not  to introduce water charges. Therefore, it has not been an option. I do not even  think that the Member would suggest that water charges should be introduced all  in one go, so the revenue that would be raised in the first number of years  would probably be quite low, as the charges would be phased in. However, I am  sure that the Member will persist in this battle, even though his colleagues  desert him, and he will make the point time and again.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Banks</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">4. <strong>Ms J  McCann </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel for his assessment of  how open and transparent local banks have been in relation to queries and  requests for information from his Department.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  648/11<a name="AQO648/11" id="AQO648/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: When I read that question, the phrase that sprang to  mind was:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Great minds think alike; fools seldom differ.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Since I have already answered that question for one  of the Member&rsquo;s colleagues, I do not know whether it is a case of great minds  or fools, but I will leave people to judge that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said before, the availability of finance is vital to  our economic recovery. It remains strategically very important, particularly in  light of events in the Irish   Republic. In that  context, my Department liaises with local banks, especially on information  about lending to small and medium-sized enterprises in Northern Ireland.  The cross-sector advisory forum made a number of recommendations. In fact, just  before I came here I had a meeting with members of the Institute of Directors  to talk about a dinner that I am going to have with representatives of the  banks next week to talk about the implementation of the 17 recommendations that  came from the cross-sector advisory forum. That forum places great emphasis on  banks increasing their lending and being more transparent about what they do in  lending to small and medium-sized enterprises in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer. Some small and medium-sized businesses are  having difficulties getting loans from banks. Has the Minister made any  representation to the British Government about the relevant powers being  devolved to this Assembly to ensure greater accountability from the banks and  the financial sector?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: First, I do not believe that devolving banking  powers to the Assembly would remedy the situation at all. One has only to look  at how ineffective the Government at Westminster  or, indeed, the Government in the Republic have been. Both poured billions of  pounds into banks yet have not been all that effective in determining how that  money has been used. In fact, to the anger of the community, that money appears  to be more readily used for fat bonuses for people who are involved in banks  rather than for distribution and lending to some of the smaller industries.  However, through the bank lending panel, the banking review and the work that  we have done in the cross-sector advisory forum on local banks, we have sought  to try to hold their feet to the fire to provide information and to raise  questions where there has been an inadequate response from the banks to the  borrowing requirement of businesses in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>:  Does the Minister share the public anger, not just in Strangford but elsewhere,  about banks calling in successful small and medium-sized enterprises and  changing the terms of their overdrafts and loans without any consultation,  thereby putting small and medium-sized enterprises that have never before  defaulted in a position where they are now likely to go bust?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: First, the description that the Member gave is not  unique to Strangford. I am sure that representatives around the Chamber could  cite examples of businesses that have made representations to them. I have had  the same response from businesses in my constituency. Indeed, I met bankers to  discuss some of the problems that constituents have drawn to my attention.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Of course I am concerned about it. That is one reason why,  along with the Bankers&rsquo; Association and the various industry representatives on  the cross-sector advisory forum, I am going next week to meet the  decision-makers at the banks to see what can be done and, in fact, to hold them  to the timetable that has now been laid down for implementing a lot of the  recommendations for improving the banking system, which came from  representatives of the industry themselves. Without that, we will not get out  of the current problem. It is not just what the Executive do with their Budget  that is important, but the oil for the wheels of the economy, which comes from  the banks. That is important, too, if we are aiming for economic recovery.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Given the bail out of the banking system in the South and the recapitalisation  of the Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks in particular, what are the  implications for the banking sector in Northern Ireland? Does that provide  greater certainty and confidence and recapitalisation here?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Any additional liquidity that goes into the banking  system is important, because that liquidity gives the banks the ability to  lend. However, the counter to that has been all the speculation about how weak  the banking system is and the lack of confidence. We could find that more and  more people will withdraw funds when they get the opportunity to do so and that  liquidity will, therefore, not be improved at all. In fact, it could be made  worse.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Last week, Arlene Foster and I met one of the Treasury  Ministers to emphasise that, if the UK  is putting &pound;7 billion into the Irish coffers for either sovereign debt or the  banks in the Irish   Republic, certain  conditions should at least be attached. Two of those conditions are that,  first, some of the liquidity that is made available should come to banks in  Northern Ireland and should not simply be confined to banks that are operating  in the Irish Republic, and, secondly, when it comes to restructuring the banks,  the jobs of people who work in banks in Northern Ireland should be considered  as well. Northern Ireland  should not be seen to be closing down branches just to save money.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Budget 2011-12</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">5. <strong>Mr P  Ramsey </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel to outline the legal  consequences if the Executive fail to agree a Budget by March 2011.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 649/11<a name="AQO649/11" id="AQO649/11"></a>)</p>

    <p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: With your permission, Mr Speaker, I will answer  questions 5 and 7 together.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The consequences of not having a draft Budget released to  the public are very serious. First, as I have outlined, the lack of certainty  will cause great distress and trauma in the economy. Secondly, the later we  leave it, the more difficult it will be to meet our legal obligations to have  proper consultation and discussion on the Budget. Thirdly, if we fail to meet  the deadline of the end of the year, it will fall to my Department to issue an  emergency Budget which, I assure you, because of the percentage of money we  will be allowed to issue, will be much more severe than what we are considering  at present.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  That ends Question Time.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Yesterday, a Cheann Comhairle, you referred to  my non-attendance at OFMDFM Question Time. I was not in attendance because of  extreme weather conditions in South Down. Indeed, members of your own staff  could not make it in to work from Newcastle.  I think that it is unfair to be lambasted for something beyond my control. I  recognise that I should have withdrawn the question, and I apologise for that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I thank the Member very much for his point of order. That is what it is all  about: informing my office or the Business Office of the absence of a Member.  That is all we are asking. That is the way forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The next item on the Order Paper is &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. The House welcomes Mr Willie Clarke&rsquo;s  explanation for yesterday, and it clarifies the situation. As you know, there  was much concern in the Procedures Committee about Question Time. I  congratulate Members and Ministers on being so prompt and efficient in their  responses and your good self, Mr Speaker, on intervening and keeping them going  along.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  This seems to be confession time.<span class="Italic"> </span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I want to comment on the point Mr Ken Robinson  made. Today&rsquo;s business at Question Time was carried out most efficiently, and  the Procedures Committee and you should be commended for the work done in  relation to that. Has the Member who was stranded yesterday ever heard of the  e-mail or telephone system?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  A point well made.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker, is it in order for the Member for East Antrim to use flattery to try to wheedle his way  into your affections in order to be called more often to speak in the Assembly?</p>

    <p class="H4StageHeading">Neighbourhood Renewal</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30 minutes for  this debate. The proposer will have 10 minutes to propose the motion and 10  minutes to make a winding-up speech. One amendment has been selected and  published on the Marshalled List. The proposer of the amendment will have 10  minutes to propose and five minutes to make a winding-up speech. All other  Members who wish to speak will have five minutes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That this Assembly calls on the Minister for Social  Development to bring forward proposals to secure neighbourhood renewal funding  beyond March 2011.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As we are all in confession mood, perhaps I should start  with a mea culpa before I proceed. The motion is timely because many groups  involved in neighbourhood renewal are wondering what their situation will be  after March 2011. The uncertainty about funding for neighbourhood renewal seems  to have been a continuing and recurring theme over the past number of years. It  can be very disheartening to groups but, despite that, they continue to  deliver. Communities have demonstrated a clear and energetic response to neighbourhood  renewal.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Last night, I attended the annual general meeting of a  community group in Newry that is very proactive. It has instigated innovative  projects in the area that have led to very positive outcomes. Once again, this  is a group trying to deal with future planning but very much in the dark when  it comes to future funding for neighbourhood renewal-led projects.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to funding and plans for a neighbourhood  renewal strategy, the Department for Social Development has stated:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;It is the Department&rsquo;s intention to continue funding  Neighbourhood Renewal after 2011.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Department&rsquo;s bid for funds for 2011-15, as part  of the Budget 2010 exercise, demonstrates a continuing commitment to the  programme. The DSD has once again reiterated that neighbourhood renewal is the  Executive&rsquo;s flagship programme for tackling spatial deprivation and that it  will seek greater collaboration with other Departments to reduce duplication,  prioritise the needs of the disadvantaged and improve the value for money  delivered by service providers, including those in the community and voluntary  sector.</p>
    <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Dallat] in the Chair)</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department for Social Development went on to say that  it is unhelpful that funding for disadvantaged communities is worked out over  the head of those communities without reference to other Departments in a way  that fails to draw on those people&rsquo;s best experience and may ultimately fail to  deliver necessary outcomes. I am not absolutely sure what that is intended to explain.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Considering the number of debates and questions over the  past three and a half years on neighbourhood renewal, it seems that DSD has  already made some efforts to deal with most if not all of the issues. In an  answer to a question posed by my colleague Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n on whether  neighbourhood renewal funding will continue after March 2011, the Minister  stated:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;It is my intention to continue funding the NR  programme after 2011 and my Budget 2011-15 bid demonstrates a continuing  increased commitment.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">However, we do not know what the bid is or whether  the level of commitment depends on the amount of the bid. Perhaps we could get  an explanation of that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As a flagship programme of the Executive in tackling  disadvantage, the neighbourhood renewal programme is essential at a time of  recession, with potentially fewer public sector jobs, and in order to maintain  stability in addressing poverty and disadvantage. Executive colleagues should  work collaboratively with the Government and with the community. The absence of  that collaboration carries a risk of a fragmented, partial and unsuccessful  approach.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In light of all the rhetoric, I ask the Minister for some  detail of what papers etc, he has brought to the Executive. Has he spoken to  other Ministers regarding their support, particularly in relation to funding  for neighbourhood renewal? The Minister appears to have left questions  unanswered, and that has created huge uncertainty in the groups that are tasked  with the delivery of neighbourhood renewal. I have witnessed in my constituency  the tremendous and essential work carried out by those groups and indeed groups  throughout the Six Counties. Their contribution in helping to develop our  communities is immeasurable. I commend the motion to the House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  beg to move the following amendment: After &ldquo;renewal&rdquo; insert</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;and small pockets of deprivation&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Small pockets of deprivation (SPOD) are an important part  of the neighbourhood renewal programme, particularly in disadvantaged  communities in my constituency. I will pick up on a comment from the proposer  of the motion, who wanted urgent action so that future funding for  neighbourhood renewal would be finalised. I agree that that needs to be  completed quickly. However, it must be pointed out that that applies not only  to neighbourhood renewal but to all public funding. Until the Budget is  finalised, no community organisation, voluntary organisation, Department or  statutory organisation knows what its funding will be. It is important that the  Budget is finalised. While there is no Budget, there is uncertainty. I suspect  that many people involved in this area may be receiving protective notices,  possibly prior to Christmas, because they do not know their future. It is  important that responsibility is taken, that a draft Budget is put on the table  and that decisions are taken.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>:  People in the voluntary sector being put on protective notice is nothing new.  It is, unfortunately, a recurring and continuing theme, which should have been  addressed a long time ago. I also say to the Member that we have no particular  problem in supporting the amendment and the inclusion of small pockets of  deprivation.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  thank the Member. Although many are aware of large-scale areas of need,  particularly in the conurbations of Belfast and Londonderry, there is an equally large number of pockets  of deprivation. I understand that, using the NISRA reports and the Noble  indices, 17 areas were identified where small communities were living in areas  of need and required support. That has been recognised. Some 36 neighbourhood  areas in the most deprived wards across Northern Ireland were identified,  as well as those 17 areas with small pockets of deprivation. I was pleased that  the January 2005 consultation report into developing new neighbourhood renewal  policy addressed the inequality issues of possible exclusion and that it was  agreed to proportionately fund those small pockets. To have done otherwise  would have been discriminatory.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although relatively small amounts of funding for those  communities may be involved, nevertheless, it is significant in assisting them  to improve their local area. To date, parts of the Sunnylands, Gortalee and  Larne Central wards in my constituency have benefited from that fund. It is  important that funding has been available. Rather than its being delivered by a  formal strategy partnership organisation, which would involve administrative  costs, it has been accepted that, given the small amounts of money involved,  other and more efficient methods should be used to cut down that administrative  burden. That could involve funding that comes directly from the Housing  Executive and councils and even from the Department for Social  Development-funded community forum.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Groups such as the Dixon Park  residents association in Larne and the Riverdale residents association have  benefited from the funding. Larne Borough Council was able to improve the local  environment considerably by upgrading the riverside walk, which enhanced access  to the local community. The funding also gave additional support to Sunnylands Nursery School, Carrickfergus Community  Forum, Greenisland Knockagh Youth Club, the library and the community council,  which had a rather ageing hall. Relatively small amounts of money made a big  difference to those deprived communities. In addition, support was given to the  Alphabet Playgroup in Greenisland for, I think, an outdoor soft-play facility,  which will benefit young people in the estate. Furthermore, the Greenisland  scout hall received additional money. I am illustrating how a lot of small  community organisations have benefited from the fund.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I noticed that, in 2009-2010, there were no applications  from Larne. It would be helpful to have an understanding of why no funding went  to Larne. I understood that it would still have qualified, but I am curious  about why no funding was drawn down. At the same time, important funding is  continuing to be delivered in the Carrickfergus area through a YMCA project  that operates out of the Sunnylands Youth Centre. It works with parents and  young children and provides additional educational courses that have enhanced  people&rsquo;s confidence. Some have been encouraged to seek employment or to get on  to an educational or employment ladder.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That element of funding has been important in that it has  provided additional community support. Part-time development workers have been  provided in some of those disadvantaged communities. It is an area in which  Peace II funding has ended and full-time community development workers are no longer  in place. The provision of support to the local community has been vital,  particularly as there is a relatively weak community infrastructure. The  support has enabled those communities to come together to apply for some other  funding, which they would not otherwise have done. Therefore, there is an  important need for that type of funding to continue in that area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I think particularly of the work of Stevie Harrison, who  operates through Carrickfergus Community Forum. He has worked with a group of  young people who could easily have become young people not in education,  training or employment. He has gathered them together, increased their  confidence, given them some life skills and anti-racism training and empowered  them so that they could learn about their importance to their local community  and contribute to it. I was fortunate to be present a couple of weeks ago when  he brought a group of those young people to Carrickfergus town hall. It was  clear that their confidence had grown, because they were able to speak to a  group of over 100 people in a town hall. They had certainly been empowered.  Therefore, neighbourhood renewal is an important element in my community.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Areas at risk are another important aspect of neighbourhood  renewal. I understand that about 20% of funding has gone towards other  disadvantaged communities in the 10% to 20% identified areas of need, which has  been quite significant for recent work in the Larne area, particularly in the  Craigy Hill/Antiville area. During the summer, I was fortunate to go along and  learn about the progress there, particularly the work of Patricia Brennan and  Ledcom, which administers the scheme on behalf of DSD. Opportunities for  volunteering in the area have been mapped, and people with time and skills have  been drawn together to try to improve their local community. Local churches  have also been drawn in to utilise their skills. So there is a real sense of  community and hope there.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At the same time, one of the most positive aspects of  change that I have noticed in the programme is that paramilitary murals are  coming down. Individuals are gaining confidence in themselves and their  community. Peace is being secured with relatively small amounts of money, and  it is vital that that continues. Areas that have received funding are also  covered by the Horizon Sure Start programme, of which I am a committee member.  Other organisations recognise that there is need there, and they are working  with different age groups. To ensure that change happens and improvements come  about, it is important that a collective operation works with a range of  individuals and young people in the area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Having looked at the new NISRA indices, I recognise that  there has been change. Some areas are now identified as being among the 10%  most deprived wards, whereas others have moved out of that category.  Nevertheless, I note that a considerable number of wards in my constituency,  East Antrim, appear to be in the 10% to 20% at-risk category, including  Ballyloran, Love Lane, Killycrot, Antiville, Eden, Sunnylands, Gortalee and  Blackcave: a host of places. If anything, conditions in my constituency have  worsened. I view pockets of deprivation funding as being relatively small  amounts of money. It is vital that it continues, in order to strengthen my  community.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should bring his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  ask Members to support my amendment.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development (Mr Hamilton)</strong>: I shall begin by  outlining some of the views expressed by the Social Development Committee about  neighbourhood renewal, before a quick costume change into a DUP MLA.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The House will be well aware that the Social Development  Committee considered the implementation of the neighbourhood renewal strategy  earlier in this mandate. The Committee produced a report that was debated and  approved by the Assembly in March 2009. Among the report&rsquo;s wide-ranging  findings, the Committee concluded that a neighbourhood renewal strategy was  important for tackling deprivation in some of the poorest wards in Northern Ireland.  As Members are aware, the idea behind neighbourhood renewal was to replace  short-term, project-led interventions with a longer-term strategy. The strategy  was supposed to tackle the multiplicity of factors that affect deprivation and  the so-called quality of life gap between neighbourhood renewal areas and the  rest of Northern Ireland.  Those factors cover familiar social development territory, such as vacant  housing, derelict industrial sites, income deprivation and low community  participation. However, neighbourhood renewal was also designed to tackle  related matters, such as high crime rates, low educational attainment and low  life expectancy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion refers to funding for the strategy. In its  response to the Committee&rsquo;s report, the Department gave a budget commitment up  to March 2011 for projects meeting priority need. The Department also  identified a list of capital projects designed to improve the physical  appearance of deprived areas. In September 2010, the Committee was pleased to  note a number of departmental capital bids relating to the neighbourhood  renewal strategy for the next Budget period. The Committee also noted the  Department&rsquo;s continued commitment to funding the strategy, as set out in  correspondence in October. I hope that, in his response, the Minister will give  further information on how, in delivering neighbourhood renewal, he will  prioritise the needs of the disadvantaged and improve the value for money  delivered by service providers, including the community and voluntary sector.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In my remaining time, I shall make some comments in a  personal and party capacity. My earlier point about replacing short-term,  project-led interventions leads me to highlight the lack of success that that  approach has had in tackling deep-rooted disadvantage in some of the most  deprived communities in Northern    Ireland. Therefore, we should all welcome  the replacement of that with a longer-term strategy. Even though I have no  particular direct experience of neighbourhood renewal in my constituency, I  have experience of the small pockets of deprivation programme, which I will  address in a minute or two.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have met representatives from neighbourhood renewal  areas, and, although they have the odd complaint &mdash; we hear regular complaints  from them &mdash; they are as one in welcoming the fact that long-term commitments  have been made to their areas. That gives them some certainty. The motion  highlights the perpetual lack of certainty in that area of work, which is that  there is no specific funding guarantee beyond March 2011.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I take Mr Beggs&rsquo;s point that this is, at its core, a Budget  issue. As we speak, there is no agreed Budget. Even if I wanted to, I do not  have enough time to open up that issue. However, it underlines the importance  for us all of agreeing a Budget as quickly as we can. We are all aware of the  uncertainty not just in tackling deprivation and disadvantage across Northern Ireland  but in maintaining good projects that have delivered and instigating new  projects that will deliver in the upcoming financial period. We know that there  are issues. We heard the First Minister yesterday, in response to Mr O&rsquo;Loan,  talk about the uncertainty caused by the issuing of protective notices. There  is an onus on all Members to deal with the issue as quickly as possible. I am  sure that the Minister for Social Development would, if he could, come forward  today to give some certainty to people who are living with uncertainty at  present.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank my friends in the Ulster Unionist Party for tabling  their amendment. I have direct experience of SPOD in areas such as the Glen,  Scrabo and West Winds in Newtownards, which the Minister visited recently. I  have witnessed the transformation of those areas, which has been achieved  principally through the drive and determination of the community but also  through the assistance of programmes such as SPOD.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Bring your remarks to a close, please.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development</strong>: There is no certainty about the  future funding of SPOD. I ask the Minister, even if he cannot outline funding,  to say what his plans are for the continuation of that programme.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  I support the motion and the amendment. Neighbourhood renewal is the  Executive&rsquo;s flagship programme to address disadvantage. It is an essential  strategy, and it is working. As we have heard, well over 600 individuals are  engaged in delivering the services through more than 300 projects, and 280,000  people rely on the additional services that neighbourhood renewal funding  supports. The public groundswell of support for the programme was made clear at  the rally of neighbourhood renewal groups at Stormont only last week. At that  rally, Minister Attwood told the groups that they should keep up their campaign  and widen it to cover other areas of disadvantage, including social housing,  child maintenance and welfare.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At a time of growing need, tackling disadvantage is  non-negotiable. That is why the more voices that are raised in support and the  more the groundswell grows, the better. At every level and primarily through  Minister Alex Attwood and Margaret Ritchie before him, the SDLP is committed to  the neighbourhood renewal programme and to ensuring that funding is continued  well beyond 2011. Indeed, Alex Attwood has made it absolutely clear that he  will continue to advance the programme at the Executive in order to secure the  &pound;20 million a year in revenue that goes into the relevant communities that are  in need.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP believes that those in need must not carry the  burden of Budget reductions. Any loss in neighbourhood renewal funding could  result in that outcome. We will continue to work to convince everyone that  money should go into areas of need, and, as recent community support  demonstrates, neighbourhood renewal should be the strategy for doing so.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That brings me to my next point, which is about the plans  of the First Minister and deputy First Minister for a so-called community  renewal fund. In other words, it is a proposal that was developed by Peter  Robinson and Martin McGuinness to fund certain groups in republican and  loyalist areas. The SDLP believes that such a fund would be exclusive and elitist  in design and would be a backward step. It seems that the proposal was  developed over the head of Departments and, indeed, over the head of the  community. That is the wrong approach. A joined-up approach is needed, and  neighbourhood renewal is now the established mechanism for the delivery of  programmes to combat disadvantage. That is why I support continued  neighbourhood renewal funding through 2011 and beyond.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will address the need for a joined-up approach in a  little more detail. Although the Department for Social Development has a key  role in implementing the neighbourhood renewal programme, it is not the sole  responsibility of DSD to address the needs of the disadvantaged here. Other  Departments and, indeed, their agencies must work with DSD to address the needs  that are outlined in the action plans for each of the 36 neighbourhood renewal  areas. Therefore, I welcome the fact that other parties have shown their  support on the Floor for the continuation of the renewal programme. My party  and I hope that, in turn, all parties will make the case for the continuation  of neighbourhood renewal funding to all Ministers in the Executive.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  support the motion and the amendment. I was heartened by the Minister&rsquo;s recent  statement that the family of responsibilities in the Department, including  neighbourhood renewal, was all about the people, families and communities who  are in need and living in disadvantage. He also said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;If one essential value of the Budget is not to  protect them, it will not be much of a Budget, and we will not be much of a  Government.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Official  Report, Vol 58, No 2, p63, col 1]</span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I hope that the Minister&rsquo;s response this afternoon  will contain similar sentiments. The lack of Executive agreement on the Budget  is causing a lot of uncertainty and concern for everyone, particularly for  projects that await decisions on funding. If the Budget is not sorted out soon,  staff will, come January, have to be given protective notices in case funding  is not forthcoming.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The past few years have been difficult for neighbourhood  renewal partnerships, which have received funding on a year-by-year basis. The  lack of certainty about funding each year has meant that many neighbourhood  renewal partnership projects have remained short-term. They have kept ticking  over rather than driving forward strategic and longer-term actions. Those  short-term actions, by their nature, may not have any substantial impact on  their communities. The short-term funding has also resulted in the quick  turnover of staff, as I have seen. Uncertainty about job security results in a  lack of continuity not only in work programmes but in their relationships with  project users in their community. It is important that funding continues beyond  March 2011 and that the Minister makes a commitment that neighbourhood renewal  will be given long-term stability through its funding for the next four years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Neighbourhood renewal partnerships target communities in  the 10% most disadvantaged urban wards. Those communities will be  disproportionately affected by public expenditure cuts because they are more  likely to use statutory services. They will also be hardest hit by the proposed  welfare reforms, namely the benefit reductions. They will be pushed out to work  when there is none. At a time of deepening hardship, neighbourhood renewal  should be strengthened rather than diminished to support those communities in  need.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Despite some criticism, neighbourhood renewal partnerships  have made positive inroads into lifting many people&rsquo;s quality of life. In my South Belfast constituency, numerous projects in  education, training, community development and health and well-being have been  highly effective and have benefited many people. We perhaps need to put new  impetus into neighbourhood renewal partnerships to empower those communities to  address the issues of deprivation that they have worked so hard to identify.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We also need commitments from other Departments, such the  Department of Education and the Department for Employment and Learning, to stop  paying lip service and to put more resources into realising the targets that  are deemed necessary by partnership action plans. Departments need to send  senior staff to the partnerships rather than personnel who are unable to make  decisions on behalf of their Departments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The South West Neighbourhood Renewal Partnership in south Belfast is proactive in  assessing the action plans that identified what has been achieved to develop a  revised action plan and to ensure that priorities are achievable and realistic.  Perhaps there is a need for more collaboration between partnerships and  projects to focus on issues across the whole area, such as health and  education, to cut down on duplication and to focus resources. That may save  statutory bodies from stretching their manpower and perhaps improve their  attendance and participation.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>: I  support the motion and the amendment. Since the neighbourhood renewal scheme  was launched in June 2003, it has helped many areas in Northern Ireland  to tackle disadvantage in their communities. Deprivation exists in every  country, but Northern    Ireland is a special case after 30 years of  community division, violence and sectarianism. That has had a profound effect  on the social and economic opportunities that are open to people who live in  areas of disadvantage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My area is often referred to as the &ldquo;gold coast&rdquo;, but that  is far from the case, and, since my election to the House in 2003 and  re-election in 2007, I have worked hard for many communities in north Down,  including Kilcooley, Rathgill, Bloomfield, Whitehill and Breezemount in Bangor,  Beechfield in Donaghadee and Loughview in Holywood to name but a few. Many of  those areas have never been included as part of the neighbourhood renewal  scheme, despite having the same problems as Kilcooley.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Kilcooley has benefited greatly from neighbourhood renewal  schemes, and those benefits are visible. However, it is still not finished, and  much work remains to be done. There is now a strong and vibrant community there  working for the betterment of its areas and the benefit of its people. That is  down to the local community association, various groups and Kilcooley&rsquo;s  neighbourhood renewal community worker, Mark Gordon, who is doing a fantastic  job. The Minister for Social Development has visited the area on numerous  occasions and seen the benefits of the scheme for himself.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The scheme should be renewed. It is vital for the many  areas of disadvantage across Northern    Ireland, never mind north Down. The scheme  aims to tackle the complex nature of social deprivation and has four main  objectives. The first of those is community renewal to develop confident  communities that are able and committed to improving the quality of life in the  most deprived neighbourhoods. A second aim is economic renewal to develop  economic activity in the most deprived neighbourhoods and to connect them to  the wider urban community. A third aim is social renewal to improve social  conditions for people who live in the most deprived neighbourhoods through  better co-ordination, public services and the creation of safer environments. A  fourth aim is physical renewal to help to create attractive, safe and  sustainable environments in the most deprived neighbourhoods.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">OFMDFM&rsquo;s programme for cohesion, sharing and integration is  evidence of the fact that much work needs to be done and that deprivation is a  factor in sectarianism and violence. We must not lose focus but enhance the  work that has gone on in the past so that it continues after March 2011.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The report by the Committee for Social Development on the  neighbourhood renewal strategy, which was completed in February 2009, came up  with many recommendations. Much of those focused on setting targets and  adhering to them. It was found that this had been lacking in previous years and  that setting of targets would also contribute to measuring success. It was also  noted that a significant amount of money had been set aside for the scheme and  that it was important to keep track of spending. Implementation and better use  of funding was considered to be down to good organisation reflected in  governance, which has been lacking. There was also believed to be a severe lack  of communication and support for groups from the top down.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As we move forward, all those recommendations need to be  adhered to. That will be to the benefit of the local community in receipt of  the scheme. I am not immune to criticism, as highlighted in the Committee  report, but I am a firm believer that the scheme has benefited many communities  across Northern Ireland  since 2003.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am glad that we are also talking about SPOD. It would be  remiss of me not to mention the great work that Karen Worrall does on that  front with the community in Rathgill, Bangor.  It would also be remiss of me not to mention the new areas at risk initiative  in Beechfield, Donaghadee, which the previous Social Development Minister  Margaret Ritchie launched almost two years ago. That also needs to be  protected, and I hope that the Minister takes that on board.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom taca&iacute;ocht a  thabhairt don r&uacute;n.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion and the amendment. It is worthwhile  reminding ourselves of the motion. It states:</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;That this Assembly calls on the Minister for Social  Development to bring forward proposals to secure neighbourhood renewal funding  beyond March 2011.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The tone of the debate thus far has been positive,  and I would like it to continue that way. The motion will assist the Minister  in his dealings and discussions with Executive colleagues and in securing  funding for areas of social deprivation and for targeting social need.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many examples of neighbourhood renewal have been given thus  far, and, as I proceed through my contribution, I will give examples of areas  in my constituency that have benefited from such renewal. If used wisely by any  Minister, the motion and the Hansard report of this debate could be tools of  persuasion in the Budget debate with other Ministers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Neighbourhood renewal has brought great benefits to parts  of the Upper Bann constituency, including  Lurgan, Brownlow and Portadown. There are significant pockets of deprivation in  each of those areas, and neighbourhood renewal has been used successfully by  local community groups to provide funding. It is worth noting that the work  done by those groups in Upper Bann is not  paid. Rather, all the money received is directed either to capital  infrastructure or to programmes on the ground.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Despite some ill-advised criticism from one of my Upper  Bann colleagues in an earlier debate, it is worth nothing exactly what  voluntary community workers in Upper Bann have  achieved with that funding. The Southern Regional College received &pound;464,000 for  a learning to employment programme, in which the community works with the local  college. The college must be congratulated for its contribution to  neighbourhood renewal projects in Upper Bann.  It has been to the forefront of helping and advising the community and  listening to its needs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Multi-use games areas in the community have made small but  significant infrastructural contributions to by providing sports facilities for  young and old people. The total amount spent on such projects is almost  &pound;80,000.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Brownlow Ltd provides an economic regeneration programme in  the heart of Brownlow. That area often receives a bad press, sometimes because  of the acts of a small group of individuals and sometimes because of media  prejudice. However, neighbourhood renewal has contributed &pound;900,000 to Brownlow  Ltd&rsquo;s economic redevelopment unit, thereby helping to create jobs in the area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, &pound;769,000 has been provided to the Southern  Education and Library Board for literacy support. That came about after  consultation and discussions with local schools on how neighbourhood renewal  could best help them. There have been similar infrastructural projects in  Portadown. One such example is Roads Service&rsquo;s collaboration with the  neighbourhood renewal programme to make improvements in the area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, despite the initial ill-advised criticism,  neighbourhood renewal has made a significant change to the lives of the  communities in Upper Bann&rsquo;s areas of  deprivation. It has shown that local communities can work and provide for  themselves when given the resources to do so. Neighbourhood renewal has not  only made a physical contribution to those areas, it has given the communities  a sense of self-worth. People in those communities have seen what is possible.  They know that the way things were was not acceptable, and they now intend to  move forward and to make improvements.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  Does the Member agree that if we did away with neighbourhood renewal, SPOD and  areas at risk, it would lead to a gulf between the community and statutory  bodies and between the community and the Government? Does he agree that that  would be disastrous?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  agree with the Member. What we have seen with neighbourhood renewal is  democracy at work. Through that scheme, local communities have made the  statutory agencies answerable to them, and both sectors now work together in a  co-ordinated way. As elected representatives, our role is to open doors and to  ensure that agencies listen to communities. Through neighbourhood renewal,  there is a constant flow of information and dialogue between those two sides.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am concerned when I hear commentators, especially  politicians, saying that we need to agree a Budget quickly, because that is  code for saying that we need to agree their vision of a Budget quickly. I have  no doubt that a Budget will be agreed, but a process must be gone through, and  in these dire financial circumstances, that process must be more detailed and  intense. A Budget will be agreed quickly if that Budget is designed to look  after areas of need by providing for neighbourhood renewal and protecting the  vulnerable, including those who come from socially and economically deprived  areas and those on low wages.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have heard comments from all sections of the Chamber over  the past number of weeks.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Bring your remarks to a close, please.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Those comments give me confidence that, at long last, we have a focus on and a  vision of that type of Budget.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: I,  too, support the motion and the amendment. Neighbourhood renewal has a vital  role in assisting disadvantaged areas across the Province, and it reflects Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  special circumstances after 30 years of violence. Deprivation in areas of  disadvantage has long been linked to segregation, violence and sectarianism.  Therefore, Northern Ireland  is unique and a special case, and it is vital that the funding for  neighbourhood renewal continues after March 2011. It is through that scheme  that we promote social inclusion and seek to reduce the inequalities in our  society.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Neighbourhood renewal ties in closely with the cohesion,  sharing and integration strategy, which was published by OFMDFM. Some of the  goals of neighbourhood renewal are to promote equality of opportunity and to  tackle disadvantage, and it is vital that we continue with that programme. It  is also vital that we continue with the small pockets of deprivation scheme and  with areas at risk, which was the scheme that I was most involved in with the  previous Minister for Social Development. All those Members who have  contributed to the debate have mentioned the special areas in their  constituencies. My special areas are Seymour Hill and Derriaghy, and I pay  tribute to the previous Minister who visited those areas, saw their needs and  dealt with the situation. I was delighted to see that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, neighbourhood renewal needs some work on its  delivery. In February 2009, the Committee for Social Development looked at the  overall scheme, which was launched in March 2003. It found that, although much  work had been done, there was little measurable improvement since the scheme&rsquo;s  implementation. I remember thinking at the time that the scheme was very much  like a duck that paddles like mad underneath the surface but does not get very  far.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is an issue about how we see deliverable targets. At  the time, there was a great deal of criticism of the statutory bodies for not  working well enough with the community organisations. However, I am sure that  the Minister will address those issues and will help people to move their  communities forward so that they can get out of the deprivation that,  unfortunately, they have found themselves in.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee recognised that the scheme crosses  Departments and involves the Department for Employment and Learning. It  recommended that all budgets for the scheme be ring-fenced. However, in the  current climate, budgets need to be adhered to and well-defined goals need to  be set. If we are to look after the budgets and continue neighbourhood renewal  projects, there must be well-defined and deliverable targets.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with the point made by the Member who spoke before  me that neighbourhood renewal projects are critical to the communities that  they serve. My colleague Mr Easton rightly pointed out that a gulf will open  between communities, government and all the statutory bodies if the projects  are not continued. In most cases, that would put communities back not only  years but decades. As elected Members, we have all witnessed huge change in our  areas. My constituency is unrecognisable today from the place that it was 10  years ago.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At the time, the Committee believed that governance  arrangements for neighbourhood renewal were ineffective. If we are to continue  to fund neighbourhood renewal, those arrangements need to be tightened up. The  Committee for Social Development made 16 recommendations with regard to the  neighbourhood renewal strategy. Those centred on targets, measuring results &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to draw his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: &mdash;  governance and better support. I firmly believe that the motion and the  amendment are worth supporting.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  It is encouraging that the Assembly is speaking about neighbourhood renewal in  a united way. Despite differences as regards policy objectives, evaluation and  welfare reform, we have spoken with a united voice today about our commitment  to tackle disadvantage and to say that neighbourhood renewal funding should be  fought for in the Budget. It is absolutely vital if we are to improve the  communities that many Members have mentioned. It is vital that work continues  both in neighbourhood renewal and in the small pockets of deprivation scheme,  which my colleague mentioned.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am not sure whether the Minister wants to be linked too  closely with the CSI strategy. However, I take Mr Craig&rsquo;s point about the link  between CSI and neighbourhood renewal. We will leave CSI for another occasion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many Members have spoken about the need to tackle  neighbourhood renewal. Policies need to be continued right across the board.  Those policies work, and it is right that they continue. Communities need help  to get out of poverty. They need help with schooling, disadvantage and  employment and to tackle not only need but needs. There are lists of indicators  of poverty that show that those communities need and deserve help to get out of  poverty.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Neighbourhood renewal has been an excellent example of  government and the community and voluntary sector working together to deliver a  common aim. Government setting out a strategy and using the community and  voluntary sector as the delivery mechanism for much of it is a good model that  should continue. I am sure that the Minister is fighting hard for neighbourhood  renewal in the Budget review. However, I take issue with Mr O&rsquo;Dowd&rsquo;s point. We  need to agree a Budget. These issues have not arisen suddenly. The budgetary  and financial difficulties have been with us for several years now. There have  been excessive problems in the Republic &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Does the Member agree that Mr O&rsquo;Dowd&rsquo;s comments were telling of Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s  anti-cut agenda in the South in preparation for elections there and did not  deal with the failure to deliver a Budget in the North?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  We have won an election.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I agree with Mrs Kelly. His comments were more about fighting that election. I  heard Mr O&rsquo;Dowd say from a sedentary position that his party has won an  election, but it has not won the general election that is coming down there.  For all the citizens who live in the Republic, I hope that they do not win it,  or else the country really will be up for sale. It will be like the old saying,  &ldquo;Would the last one leaving Ireland  please turn out the lights?&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have confidence that the Minister will fight to get and  to maintain neighbourhood renewal schemes and will work to build on the  successes that we have had, while taking on board the useful comments and  recommendations from the Committee, although I was not a member of the  Committee at the time. Committees play a very useful role by looking at policy  objectives and how they play out on the ground. It is vital that the Minister  and his Department take those recommendations on board to see how we can  improve this, how we can deliver and how we can help more people out of poverty  and disadvantage. That is the united cry going out from the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind Members that the election is not until next May.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I support the motion and the amendment. It is quite clear that neighbourhood  renewal is targeted at areas of disadvantage, and it is right that areas of  deprivation are included. It is also an issue in rural areas. Some rural areas  have a number of commuters living in them who are not part of the indigenous  community and do not often get involved in the local community. It is,  therefore, important that all areas of disadvantage are tackled.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister share my disappointment that OFMDFM is  very much behind in its schedule to meet its legislative requirement on the  child poverty strategy, which will have to have a quicker Committee  consultation period than ought to be the case?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Other Members have said that neighbourhood renewal is not  the sole responsibility of DSD. It is not substitution for other Departments,  it is about additionality and about other Departments being able to bring to  the table projects that they can deliver in a much more timely manner than would  otherwise be the case, because they should all be bringing their resources to  the table.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  The Member talked about other Departments bringing projects. The Department of  Education&rsquo;s recent nought-to-six strategy has been one of the most disappointing  strategies because it looks more like a three-to-six strategy and has missed  the mark dramatically in delivering some of what the Member is talking about.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member has an additional minute.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member makes a valid point about education, because Mr  O&rsquo;Dowd highlighted the sterling work of the partnership, the Southern Regional  College and the local schools in trying to tackle the literacy problem. It is  obviously a failure of education that neighbourhood renewal money is having to  be spent in that way. Had we got a timely early-years strategy, the money could  have been put to other uses through the building of real and sustainable jobs  in the local community.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  am glad that the Member has stepped into the field of education. I will educate  her slightly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Numeracy and literacy factors is as much to do with  education in the classroom as it is to do with your environment on the outside.  If a child is coming from an area where there is not high educational  attainment, the likelihood is that that child will not reach educational  attainment itself. If you want to have a wee lesson on education, give me a  shout some day and we will have a chat about it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind Members that we are talking about neighbourhood renewal.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  In deference to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will not point out the obvious  grammar mistakes that Mr O&rsquo;Dowd made.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The fact is that neighbourhood renewal ought to be about  not only improving the environment and the learning experience, but leaving a  legacy. Mr O&rsquo;Dowd was right about one thing: no jobs have been created in the  Craigavon area. That is a feature that the Minister must look at throughout the  neighbourhood renewal areas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The whole point of community development is to enable and  to empower local communities and to leave a legacy. When community development  workers can leave the stage, they have succeeded. I pay tribute to many of the  development workers, who often work long hours for no remuneration or for  remuneration that is not sufficient and does not meet their needs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Nonetheless, there is a real requirement, particularly in  the Lurgan area. We have a town centre suffering the decline that is evident in  many market towns across the North. There is a need for the neighbourhood  renewal money to be spent on economic regeneration, and I want to see that  happening.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Dowd&rsquo;s other point was about how other Ministers will  be all-singing and all-dancing in favour of neighbourhood renewal. He  eloquently said that neighbourhood renewal is significant, opens the doors to  democracy, and is very much a grass-roots, bottom-up approach to development. I  hope that other Ministers will take note of those remarks, and that he will  convey those remarks to his own Ministers in the Executive, because it is very  important that other Ministers recognise the role, function and importance of  neighbourhood renewal and support Minister Attwood in his bid for funding to be  secured.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Other Members were right to say that there is a necessity  for some certainty about the security of funding, because there are those who  depend on neighbourhood renewal for their employment. They will be at risk if a  Budget is not agreed sooner rather than later. Even if redundancy notes are  issued only as a protective measure by employment organisations, they are  nonetheless letters that people do not want falling on their mats at the mouth  of Christmas. People need to have certainty around their employment, and I hope  that the Executive will get over their current difficulties in trying to reach  agreement on the matter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One other feature of neighbourhood renewal is that it  supports areas that suffered at the hands of paramilitaries. Let us not forget  that point. It is not about just poverty but about the fact that paramilitary  organisations did not allow good work to be done in many of their areas. I hope  that, now that peace is secured, everyone&rsquo;s voice across the neighbourhood  renewal partnerships will be heard, and not just those of a select few.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Bring your remarks to a close, please.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I very much support the motion and the amendment.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind Members please not to shout from a sedentary position.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Anderson</strong>:  I support the motion and also the amendment, which was tabled by John  McCallister and Roy Beggs. The question of neighbourhood renewal is one that  every Member could say much about. Many communities across Northern Ireland  stand in need. There are a number of reasons why many communities are in that  position.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Neighbourhood renewal is not about just targets and  budgets. It is really about people from all sections of the community who live  in some of the poorest areas of Northern    Ireland. Many of those areas are often  characterised by poor educational attainment, poor health and shorter life  expectancy. Very often, they are accompanied by higher unemployment, lower  economic activity, higher crime rates and infrastructure problems.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In 2003, Government, through the Department for Social  Development, launched a strategy for neighbourhood renewal in the Province.  Three of the areas targeted for neighbourhood renewal &mdash; Brownlow, Lurgan and  north-west Portadown &mdash; are in my constituency around Craigavon. Three  neighbourhood renewal partnerships were established across Craigavon and  approximately &pound;8 million was spent in those areas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I should declare an interest as a member of Craigavon  Borough Council.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In Craigavon, funding was provided for a health and well-being  programme, a social renewal education programme, multi-use games areas,  environmental improvement schemes, training and employability courses, and  economic and community development. That is to be welcomed, but, as with Upper  Bann, so right across Northern    Ireland, serious issues remain and serious  problems still need to be addressed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I note that, in response to a question for written answer,  the Minister said that he intends to fund the neighbourhood renewal programme  after 2011 and that he is making bids to enable him to do so.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Only last week, the Minister indicated his  intention to explore the issue of parity with respect to the welfare budget. I  am concerned, and I am led to ask the question: if he were to gain breach of  parity on the welfare budget, and if the consequence of that breach were that  some, or all, of that budget were removed by the Treasury, with the Executive  left to pick up the tab, how would the Minister finance not only this programme  but a number of other programmes? Since the debate is about the continued  funding of the programme &mdash;</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  I am confused. Are you asking the Minister to breach parity, or are you saying  that he should not breach it?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Anderson</strong>:  I am not asking the Minister to breach parity.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The debate is about the continued funding of the programme.  We cannot unhitch that funding from the Minister&rsquo;s intention to chisel away at  parity. If that is his intention, maybe he can give us some clarity on the  issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will turn now to the amendment tabled by John McCallister  and Roy Beggs. It addresses what is a widespread issue across multiple  constituencies in the Province. By that, I mean that it addresses those pockets  of deprivation that are often overlooked, through no fault of their own, but  solely because of the areas or housing developments that are along their  boundaries.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although I welcome the investment already made in my  constituency, I have to point out that, in Upper Bann,  there are numerous pockets of deprivation, where the levels of poverty, educational  underachievement and poorer health are comparable to elsewhere, yet they fall  through the net because they are bordered by what are seen as more affluent  areas. Clearly, that should not continue. Where there are pockets of  deprivation, that deprivation is as real and as punishing as in any other area.  My colleagues have already referred to areas at risk.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I believe that there is still a long way to go to address  the issue adequately, and I call on the Minister to set about that task.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development &nbsp;(Mr Attwood)</strong>: I  thank all the Members who contributed to the debate. In his opening remarks, Mr  Brady read into the record a recent press release that I issued as Minister.  That must be the first time that a Member from a one party has read into the  record a statement from a Minister of a different party, but I thank him for so  doing, because it captured a lot of the issues around the debate. However, I  differ with him in one regard. He said that people in neighbourhood renewal areas,  organisations and employees were being kept in the dark. That is not a  consequence of anything that I have done. As Mr Beggs and other Members made  clear, if people are being kept in the dark, it is a consequence of the fact  that the Budget negotiations are in the dark and are still not concluded. To go  back to what Mr O&rsquo;Dowd said, that is not a passing point or a political point.  It is a very real and genuine point.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Four months from today, 695 people who are funded through  neighbourhood renewal could potentially lose their jobs. As Mrs Kelly  indicated, on Christmas Eve or on New Year&rsquo;s Eve, up to 695 people &mdash; 683 in  neighbourhood renewal areas and 12 in small pockets of deprivation areas &mdash; may  be carrying protective notices in their back pockets or in their purses. That  is the reality of people being in the dark about where the Budget is today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let us maximise our Budget negotiation with London. That is what I  was doing yesterday in respect of the welfare aspect of our Budget, and I will  comment on that later. If anything should bring reality and good sense to the  Budget negotiations, it is the fact that 695 people in DSD-funded neighbourhood  renewal schemes and hundreds, if not thousands, of people in other Departments,  including Health, could fall victim to the same circumstance. Therefore, in  dealing with neighbourhood renewal and DSD budgets, let us create certainty  around all budgets, so that everybody can go forward on the basis of confidence  rather than doubt. As Ms Lo said, if we do not agree a four-year Budget, and a  one-year Budget is imposed, it will not be much of a Budget, and we will not be  much of a Government.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank everyone who acknowledged that strategies for  neighbourhood renewal, SPOD and areas at risk are working. The fact that it was  said with such clarity by Members from all parties is a watershed moment.  Historically, going back five, six or seven years, neighbourhood renewal has  been caught up in community politics. The consensus on neighbourhood renewal,  SPOD and areas at risk is a watershed moment because it breaks free from the  notion that one community suffers more need and disadvantage than another. The  consensus, which is that funding and strategies must be taken forward together  to deal with the particular issues in areas of need and disadvantage, creates  common ground.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">What happened in the Chamber today and on the steps of  Parliament Buildings last Monday represents a groundswell of support for  neighbourhood renewal. In that context, I repeat what I said, which has been  referred to in the Chamber. I encourage Members that, if there is a groundswell  of support for neighbourhood renewal, it follows that there should be a  groundswell of support for all those front line services, wherever they might  be located in government, including in DSD.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Ms Lo said, neighbourhood renewal cannot be divorced  from housing. Neither of those issues can be divorced from child maintenance,  and none of the three can be divorced from social security and benefit take-up.  There is a family of need and a family of government responses to that need, be  that through DSD, nurses, teachers or all other front line services. When I  send a copy of today&rsquo;s Hansard report to the First Minister and deputy First  Minister and to the Minister of Finance, I will implore them to recognise that  family of need in any decisions that they might take on a budgetary or  departmental level. Let us also ensure that the groundswell of support extends  throughout the family of services that DSD provides, because, as much as any Department,  and more so than most, it is a front line service provider in tackling need and  disadvantage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Recently, there has been some mischief-making about the  Department and my personal commitment to neighbourhood renewal. The fact that  it has not raised its head during the debate means that that particular issue  has been laid to rest. Let me repeat that the Budget bid that I submitted in  July 2010 included a full bid, for capital and revenue, for neighbourhood  renewal going forward in the 2011-15 period.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In August 2010, arising from the circumstances of the  summer, I wrote to the First Minister and deputy First Minister and suggested  that, in view of the budgetary situation, and rather than duplicating or  further dissipating scarce resources, we should work to improve and to refocus  our existing initiatives to create the best opportunity for success in areas of  need and disadvantage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, in my Budget bid, the information that I  provided in summary and then in substance to the Committee for Social Development,  my letter to OFMDFM, and in every opportunity that I have had, publically and  privately, to commit myself and the Department to neighbourhood renewal going  forward, I have been unambiguous. Any suggestion otherwise is, as I said last  week, party political, partial and self-serving. I am glad that that issue did  not raise its head during the debate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A number of Members, including Mr Brady, Mr Beggs, and the  Committee Chairperson, Mr Hamilton, asked how neighbourhood renewal should be  taken forward. I am not prepared just to sit back and to say, &ldquo;Steady as you  go&rdquo;. If there are ways in which the Government in Northern Ireland, throughout their  Departments, can do their work and business better, we should embrace that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That is why I have invited organisations from across the  range of DSD&rsquo;s responsibility to look at how they do their work. There are  7,000 charities, 4,500 voluntary and community works, 33 housing associations  and three advice networks. That is the scale of much of what DSD is involved in  and funds. I have asked organisations across the range of those sectors whether  there are ways that we could do things differently. At times, I have encouraged  organisations to look at doing things differently, and, on one or two  occasions, I have bluntly told them that they should do things differently. If  there is a way of doing things going forward that protects budget lines,  secures jobs, improves services and delivers better outcomes, we, as MLAs and  Ministers, would be neglectful if we did not take those opportunities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am committed to the concept and practice of neighbourhood  renewal, and I have demonstrated that through what I have done in Budget bids  and thereafter. However, in some neighbourhood renewal areas, there are some  matters that people need to begin to look at. Without being exhaustive or, at  this stage, prescriptive, some questions need to be asked. First, is there an  opportunity for more collaboration? Secondly, is there an opportunity for more  shared services? Thirdly, are there opportunities to deepen interdepartmental  working? Finally, are there opportunities to merge organisations? Where  neighbourhood renewal is concerned, as well as in general, those are the sorts  of concepts that we as a Government and I as a Minister have to grapple with  and deal with if we are going to maximise the benefit to the community.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In translating that into the particular work of  neighbourhood renewal, I want to lay down some further principles. When I came  into office, I said, and I am saying again now, that it was my commitment that  the areas of neighbourhood renewal that are working best and delivering the  best outcomes will get funding for a four-year cycle. I concur with the views  that hand-to-mouth, year-to-year funding is not the best way to create certainty  about employment, never mind create success with delivery. Subject to the  Budget being a four-year Budget and one that, I think, and everyone else in the  Chamber clearly thinks, is necessary for neighbourhood renewal, my commitment  is that the neighbourhood renewal projects that are working best and that  deliver the best outcomes will get a certainty of funding going forward. That  includes areas at risk and small pockets of deprivation, which are not being  excluded from the neighbourhood renewal funding stream.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Other organisations could develop further, improve their  capacity and secure better outcomes. My commitment is that the Department will  work with those organisations over the short term, and potentially over a  shorter-term funding cycle, to bring them to the place where longer-term  funding will be available. That is a responsible position that will help  organisations to mature and to fulfil their potential. By working with the  Department, organisations will get to a point where they, too, are in a position  to have longer-term funding.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Last week, people in the Suffolk/Lenadoon Interface Group  said to me that, if one or two or a small number of organisations are not  delivering the services or outcomes or are not doing all the work that DSD,  neighbourhood renewal and the community expect them to do, it would be  irresponsible for a community leader, a political leader or a Minister not to  begin to address why that was the case. Those are parts of the principles that,  going forward, should inform all our discussions and our contributions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On such occasions as this, there is an elephant in the  Chamber. The elephant in the Chamber is what appears to be a continuing effort  to develop an alternative to neighbourhood renewal. It is known as the  community renewal fund or some variation of that. What I do not understand is  this: Mr O&rsquo;Dowd said in his contribution that neighbourhood renewal had  resulted in a:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;significant change to the lives of communities&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">He said that it created &ldquo;a sense of self-worth&rdquo;; it  had &ldquo;seen what is possible&rdquo;; it was &ldquo;democracy at work&rdquo;, and it is able to:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;open doors and ensure that agencies listen to  communities.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">If that is the view of Mr O&rsquo;Dowd on how  neighbourhood renewal is bearing down on the conditions that exist in areas of  need in Northern Ireland, the outcome of that should be to build upon  neighbourhood renewal, to deepen neighbourhood renewal and to create further  resources for it. That is the conclusion from Mr O&rsquo;Dowd&rsquo;s experience in his  constituency and the narrative outlined in the Chamber this afternoon.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If that is what is working and beginning to work in the  lives of people in need, that is why, strategically, we cannot create a  situation where that effort is fragmented, a new funding mechanism and new  architecture are created, and all that architecture and the funding mechanism  are developed over the heads of government &mdash; because that is what has happened  &mdash; and over the heads of vast numbers of the community, who tell me day and  daily of their frustration and growing anger at the fact that they are now  feeling marginalised in communities that were historically marginalised for too  long in this part of Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The consequence of those observations is inevitable and  certain. It is that there should be more funding for neighbourhood renewal and  that, if there is an alternative funding source, which OFMDFM appears to be  developing over the heads of government and over the heads of the community,  that money should go to neighbourhood renewal. I am putting down the challenge.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:  Bring your remarks to a close, please.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: The challenge is this: join me in writing to Martin  McGuinness and Peter Robinson to say that, if there are other sources of  funding that they are aware of &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:  Time is up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Those sources must be redirected to neighbourhood  renewal. Let us build on the work on which Mr O&rsquo;Dowd commented.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  welcome the widespread support that has been expressed for the small pockets of  deprivation and for neighbourhood renewal funding generally. Several Members  have spoken of the need to have the budgets finalised. We all have to recognise  that, in many cases, those who are at the coalface in disadvantaged communities  are making a considerable difference. We have to value them, and part of that  is to enable them to have a degree of certainty about their employment, so it  is important that budgets are finalised and that decisions are taken well in  advance of the end-point dates. I think of funding for community forums, etc,  where frequently people do not know that there is funding for the following  year until within a month of the end of the financial year. We need to plan  better, and I welcome those comments from Members.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I mentioned that neighbourhood renewal has an effect on  peace, and others have mentioned that it is important in certain republican and  loyalist areas. Others have mentioned the cohesion, sharing and integration  strategy. Neighbourhood renewal can give hope to disadvantaged individuals and  communities, and it is important that that funding continues to be available so  that some do not fall prey to those who advocate violence as some means of  creating a cause for those who may have become disenchanted with society.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome some of the ideas from the Minister in his  response. There needs to be joint working between Departments, because smaller  groups need certainty and longer-term funding, not piecemeal funding that  constantly changes so that they are constantly engaged in working out how to  stitch together a programme based on two or three different issues. I fully  support that idea, as well as the Minister&rsquo;s latter point that there are huge  dangers if an independent funding source is suddenly created, possibly duplicating  some of the work, specifically in republican and loyalist areas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We ought to fund disadvantaged communities through our  neighbourhood renewal strategy not through a sectarian carve-up, saying, &ldquo;You  get so much for your community, Martin, and you get so much for yours, Peter.&rdquo;  We ought to use the NISRA statistics to distribute funds equitably, based on  recognised outcomes and outputs from operating groups. If groups are not  operating, I can understand what the Minister is saying: change has to occur  and there may need to be shorter-term funding until change can be shown.  However, let us have longer-term funding, projects that are seen to be working  and greater certainty so that that good work can continue on improving those  communities.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. First, I thank everyone who spoke  in what has been an interesting debate. Parts were predictable, but there were  some pleasant surprises. I thank the Assembly&rsquo;s Research and Library Service  for its information pack, which brought into focus the Committee&rsquo;s work on  neighbourhood renewal. It is a timely reminder for us all. Everybody would  probably admit that when we are working on issues, they are very relevant and  we know what they are. Nevertheless, it is good to see them outlined in the  information pack. We will be using it as a reference point.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mickey Brady outlined our party&rsquo;s support for the  amendment. Neighbourhood renewal is about dealing with the small pockets of  deprivation and the areas at risk. It is about making sure that, as much as  possible, those who experience poverty and deprivation are not left behind.  That is where many of us will probably part company, because of the variations  in some of the comments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In proposing the motion, Mickey Brady talked about the  evidence of need, and other Members mentioned that. As Mickey said, it is vital  that we look specifically at measures, initiatives and funding that overtly &mdash;  not behind the door, not shyly or discreetly, but overtly &mdash;address poverty and  deprivation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Roy Beggs spoke about the uncertainty around the Budget and  about the need to look at the 17 SPOD areas, in conjunction with the 36  neighbourhood renewal partnerships and the areas at risk. He gave some very  good examples from his constituency, as did other Members.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Simon &mdash; I actually wrote Simon Cowell; it is not Simon  Cowell, although I am sure that he wishes that he was Simon Cowell and had his  lifestyle. I actually do not watch &lsquo;The X Factor&rsquo;. I meant Simon Hamilton.  Embarrassed or what? <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In his capacity as Chairperson and as an MLA, Simon  Hamilton spoke about neighbourhood renewal, health, environment and community  safety. Indeed, he mentioned that capital bids went forward in the September  monitoring round for 2011-15. He also spoke about the importance of looking  beyond short-term funding. That is where the credit has been laid down squarely  at the feet of the neighbourhood renewal work. If funded and brought forward  through DSD and the Executive, it will be one of the projects that people can  identify for long-term funding, despite some of the difficulties with it. The  motion is about protecting investment in that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I know that the Minister met some of the groups involved  last week. The groups say that some of the ways in which neighbourhood renewal  operated were problematic. There was a great deal of focus on outputs rather  than on outcomes and, without getting into the jargon of funding initiatives or  their categories, workers may have felt that some of the work was merely  box-ticking. Although there is a need to report, be accountable and to work  according to baselines, I know, from having talked to them recently, that they  felt that some of the &mdash; there is Simon Hamilton. Sorry, Simon. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> I am sure that you wish that you had his  lifestyle and his money.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">They spoke about delivering on the needs that were  identified on the ground. Sometimes, in the time that elapses between setting  funding streams and reviewing them, other needs creep in and take prominence.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mary Bradley welcomed the motion and the amendment and  spoke about the need for neighbourhood renewal. Mary lives in a deprived area  of the North, and she should know how successful the scheme has been in her  constituency of Derry. I am sure that she will  also know what has not worked. Anna spoke about the need to strengthen the  impact of neighbourhood renewal on the ground and the need for additional  long-term funding.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Alex Easton is like Fra McCann in many respects. There are  two old friends whom Alex Easton introduces in Committee. Fra McCann&rsquo;s two old  friends are the words &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, and one of Alex Easton&rsquo;s old friends  is Kilcooley &mdash; I am not even going to name the other one. I feel as if I know  Kilcooley very well because of the way in which he brings up the topic. That is  exactly what Members should do. If Members do not bring the needs and  experiences of their constituencies into the Chamber and into debates,  realistically, what is it all about?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One issue that Alex and many others raised is the need for  targets to be set, with tracking and accountability and taking on board what  works on the ground. John O&rsquo;Dowd also picked up on that theme when he spoke  about his local college, literacy programmes in schools and infrastructural  development in his constituency. More importantly &mdash; I know that the Minister  also touched on this &mdash; he spoke about the avenue and outlet that neighbourhood  renewal has provided for what has become known as participative democracy. We  call it inclusion &mdash; people coming on board.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In many respects, when we read the report and listen to  some of our experiences, it seems that we are almost ignoring some of the  criticisms that partnerships made. Those include the criticism that Departments  and statutory bodies come to the table with nothing. Some, but not all,  departmental representatives come to the table and do not bring their  contribution. Neighbourhood renewal is led by DSD and is an interdepartmental  fund. Given the very nature of the scheme, other Departments have to  contribute. For that reason, I wrote to all Ministers to ask what contribution  they would make to neighbourhood renewal and whether they will support it in  the future. I have consistently done that. If Martin McGuinness and Peter  Robinson were responsible for neighbourhood renewal, I would be torturing them.  As our party spokesperson on social development, I have absolutely no shame and  no difficulty whatsoever in leading or organising campaigns. That is my job. We  all have different spokesperson roles, and we chase and torture different  Ministers. Rather than stamping their feet, people have to be honest about  that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I heard what the Minister said, and I am concerned. I am  prepared to give way. Is the Minister saying that OFMDFM or any other  Department has no right, and should not try, to develop initiatives that are  anti-poverty in nature and that will be complementary and additional to  neighbourhood renewal? If they were about displacement, I would not support  them. Any initiative from whatever Department will be scrutinised in the same  way as this one. Hence, it is about additionality and making sure that there is  no duplication and that every initiative meets objective need, regardless of  what it may be or what it may look like.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the same vein, community safety is cited as one example  in the neighbourhood renewal programme. Is the Minister saying that, in the new  Justice Bill, we should not make provision for community safety or funding for  groups and communities that are trying to establish and initiate community safety  programmes? Indeed, the Health Minister is here as well. When it comes to the  health aspects of neighbourhood renewal, should the Health Minister not have  any responsibility or bring forward programmes that are, by their very nature  and orientation, about community development in case it offends the Minister  for Social Development and what he is trying to do with neighbourhood renewal?  If that is the case, the Minister for Social Development has just undersold,  unpicked and unravelled his own argument for additionality.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At the last minute, I am prepared to give way, but only on  the basis that it is a genuine offer of a genuine response.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I refer the Member to my previous comments. The essence  of the argument is that neighbourhood renewal and tackling disadvantage require  partnership at community, governmental and statutory levels.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That is what has been proven to work, and that is the model  that we need to deepen and develop as we go forward. The issue is that what is  being developed, in the view of many people, is exclusive and elitist. It  involves one Government Department, one party, and a hand-picked number of  groups. That is not inclusion, equality or partnership. In those circumstances,  for all the good intentions that the Member and others have, the question is  whether it is likely to work.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  I allowed the Minister to intervene, but he accuses people of being exclusive  and elitist. I refute that allegation. It is on record that I refute it. I bear  no shame, and the Committee bears no shame, in asking for additionality.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Bring your remarks to a close, please.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  I have absolutely no difficulty in proposing that there should be  additionality. The Minister&rsquo;s party, which introduced political vetting, has a  brass neck to accuse anyone of being elitist.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Your time is up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  The Minister, Dolores and the rest have a brass neck.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Time is up. Unlike Simon Cowell&rsquo;s &lsquo;The X Factor&rsquo;, this is not a  phone-in vote.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question, That the amendment be made, put and agreed  to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Main Question, as amended, put and agreed to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That this Assembly calls on the Minister for Social  Development to bring forward proposals to secure neighbourhood renewal and  small pockets of deprivation funding beyond March 2011.</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="h"></a>Health and Social Care Services for Vulnerable People</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30  minutes for the debate. The proposer will have 10 minutes to propose the motion  and 10 minutes to make a winding-up speech. All other Members who are called to  speak will have five minutes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That this Assembly expresses concern at the ongoing  reduction in essential health and social care services for vulnerable people;  calls on the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to tackle  wastage within his Department and its agencies; and further calls on the  Minister to undertake a review of (i) spending on senior salaries, (ii)  spending on travel and accommodation for senior management and administrators,  and (iii) procurement practices within health and social care trusts.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Members know, times are tough all round with  departmental spending. In this type of situation, particularly in health, where  things are tough, the public are right to ask questions about how the health  budget is allocated. That is why the SDLP tabled the motion. Everyone here  knows that, in every constituency, cuts to services for the vulnerable are  increasing week by week. Home help budgets are shrinking; domiciliary care is  being cut; and many residential homes &mdash; for those with learning difficulties,  the disabled or the elderly &mdash; are faced with closure.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The cuts affecting the weak and vulnerable are gathering  pace while the Health Service continues to award pay increases and bonuses to  senior clinicians and some managers. The SDLP is not prepared to vote for  ring-fencing of the health budget until it is clear that the Minister and his  Department have taken steps to rein in that wastage in the system. It is in the  interests of fairness and justice at a time like this when the budget is under  so much pressure that the cuts are shared across the Health Service. There is  justification for the perception that unfairness exists in the system, not  least because of the reports of the level of spending on trips and  accommodation by those in senior management.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As a member of the Health Committee, I am well aware of the  excellent work of many senior personnel in the Department and across all the  health authorities. I am also aware of the need to improve their experiences,  skills and knowledge of best practice elsewhere. Training opportunities are, of  course, part of that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am not singling out any individuals for blame, but the  public are rightly asking questions about the extent of foreign trips and  travel for Health Service staff in recent years, and whether they are all  really necessary. We can gauge the strength of feeling about that from the 12  senior nurses who expressed their views through one of our regional newspapers.  They expressed strong concerns about the extent of overseas training and  pleaded instead for more money to be spent on employing nurses to improve  patient safety and reduce preventable deaths. Those concerns are widely shared.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to talk about the way in which they had to voice  those concerns: anonymously. No names could be given. That, I think, points to  a culture and an atmosphere in the Health Service in which many workers are  told not to speak out. They are gagged and are afraid to speak. We have direct  rule and accountability, and I want the Minister to look at this issue.  Everyone should be assured, when it comes to serious issues, that people  working in the Health Service should be free to express their views at all  times in the organisation. I understand that the Minister issued a directive  about these trips earlier in the year. He pointed to the need for some  scrutiny, but it is a warning that seems to have made little difference. The  trips have continued, and, as we know from recent exposure in the press, the  costs have kept mounting.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This news comes at a time when hospital wards are closing  and A&amp;E services are being withdrawn: think of the Mid-Ulster  Hospital and of Downe Hospital.  People are rightly asking questions: they are asking whether all of this is  really necessary. Will the Minister tell us whether it is necessary to spend  &pound;14,000 on flights and accommodation for three employees in this financial year  alone? Indeed, some people are asking why &pound;4,500 was paid in course fees for a  conference in Nice that was cancelled due to the flight limitations arising  from volcanic ash. I understand that that money has not been recovered, and I  would like the Minister to give us his view on the attempts that have been made  to recover it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are serious constraints on spending in the Health  Service as there are on every other Department, but, in the Health Service,  those cuts are impacting disproportionately on the weak and the vulnerable. The  Minister has individual responsibility for health staff, many of whom work hard  and carry a heavy burden of responsibility. I appeal to him to take action so  that constraints on spending apply at all levels in the Health Service and not  disproportionately on vulnerable people or the lowest paid workers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have already said what I think about training. Some of it  is essential to keep abreast of developments; I think everyone agrees with  that. However, there has to be a more rigorous scrutiny of the associated costs  for foreign travel, and accommodation in particular. That is also referenced in  the motion. There must also be closer scrutiny of the proposed content and  possible outcomes of meetings and conferences, judging from the comments of  those senior nurses who I have referred to. They, as Members will understand,  are the people at the coal face who know best about the real impact of the  cuts. Their view is that the value of some of these courses is very limited, to  say the least. We must be sure in the phase that we are in now that all these  journeys are really necessary. Can cheaper hotels not be found when it is  necessary to travel? There is evidence that NHS staff in England are  able to do that when they go abroad for training.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We all know about Northern Ireland&rsquo;s limitations due  to the size of our population. We do not have the economies of scale to enable  certain courses to be delivered by experts of worldwide repute so that our  staff do not have to travel. However, there is no reason why we should not look  at other possibilities. For example, the opportunity to combine with our  neighbours in the Republic   of Ireland to deliver  courses here or somewhere on the island deserves consideration. By taking such  an approach, surely costs, in some instances, could be shared and money could  be saved, which would have the knock-on effect of benefiting the Health  Service.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I call, as the motion does, for a review of the  Department&rsquo;s spending, particularly on the issues that I have outlined. A  thorough review will go some way to help protect those who are most at risk  against the reductions that taking place as we speak. The motion should help,  in some way, to protect the most vulnerable in relation to reductions in  healthcare.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: I  thank the Member for proposing the motion. I am fascinated by the way in which  the Health Service operates. The Minister&rsquo;s response to a question that I asked  revealed that the health and social care trusts employ 2,492 staff who are paid  between &pound;50,000 and &pound;100,000. I highlight that figure because it is quite  significant. They are not doctors or consultants &mdash; because approximately 920 of  doctors and consultants earn over &pound;100,000. All of us would admit that  consultants are well and truly needed in the Health Service.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The figure must include a huge level of bureaucracy.  Breaking it down further, the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust employs 798  of those people, the Northern Health and Social Care Trust employs 356, the  South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust employs 287 and the Western Health  and Social Care Trust employs 479. It is an interesting ratio, and I have  looked at it and thought about it. Why are there approximately three times the  number of people on that pay scale as there are on the consultants&rsquo; pay scale?  That is a question for the Minister to ask his Department. Why are so many  people in the Health Service on a middle-management pay scale? It far outstrips  a lot of the other Departments; in some cases, by miles.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I pay tribute to the Minister because &mdash; and I listened to  him yesterday as he stated this fact &mdash; in a press release of 5 November 2010,  he stated that he had implemented the review of public administration (RPA) and  had cut the number of admin staff and senior managers by 1,500, or 57%. Those  are his words so I pay tribute to them. There is supposed to be a &pound;49 million  saving each year from April 2011. However, an Assembly report found that RPA  made initial savings of &pound;5&middot;6 million in management and administration cost in  the Health Service. It stated that, by 2008-09, the total trust management cost  had risen again in excess of &pound;120 million.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That was the situation before the Minister introduced RPA,  so something is going wrong in the system. I do not doubt that the Minister  made those efforts to implement RPA, and I do not doubt that he meant to cut  administration. However, the figures show that something is going wrong in the  Health Service. Is it the old problem of empire building? Civil servants are  keen on that. Maybe the Minister needs to revisit that aspect of the Health  Service.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I find other areas to be absolutely amazing. Expenditure on  luxuries was referred to. How much money do the Department and trusts spend on  art, management consultancy fees, negligence claims and travel claims? The one  that astonishes me is the amount of money that is spent on taxis. There may be  a good reason for some of them, but the Southern Health and Social Care Trust  gives more than &pound;1 million a year to taxi firms, and the Western Health and  Social Care Trust spends more than &pound;0&middot;5 million a year. Some of the figures are  absolutely astonishing. Is it efficient to spend those amounts of money on  taxis? There is a joke about the other taxi service in the Health Service that  people use a lot. Unfortunately, it is the Ambulance Service.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should bring his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>:  Having seen how many individuals are paid so much, I plead with the Minister to  look once again at the management structure in the Health Service. Maybe he  will cut it back to previous levels, like he did with his health reforms?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind Members that the motion states: &ldquo;expresses concern at the  ongoing reduction in essential health and social care services for vulnerable  people&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. A number of Health Committee  members cannot be here because of an event in the Long Gallery. Their absence  is due to competing demands, not a lack interest. Obviously, I speak in favour  of the motion, and I welcome the opportunity to debate such a vital issue.  Recently, we debated domiciliary care. Yesterday, we debated the removal of  neurology beds, and, today, we debated the impact of budget cuts and  restrictions on the most vulnerable.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Last week, in my role as Mayor of Dungannon and South  Tyrone Borough Council, I hosted an event for disability-sector service users  from the area to discuss their experience of accessing health services. They  did not paint a very pretty picture. They feel that, when it comes to budget  restrictions, they are always impacted upon adversely and disproportionately,  and I very much agree with them. As budgets get tighter, the more vulnerable  people in society are always affected. Many Members could quote examples of  cases in which they are involved in their constituency that would lead everyone  to the same conclusion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, last week, the House debated domiciliary care  packages, and the Minister talked about his Department investing to provide  services. Obviously we welcome that investment, but it is simply not enough.  The reality is that money is not always spent wisely. In some cases, if the  Department were to listen to those who provide a service on the ground, it  would find better ways to do things.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion calls on the Minister to:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo; tackle wastage within his Department and its  agencies&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">We are all very much aware of wastage in the  Department, as we are aware of the high-profile stories that are currently  reaching media outlets, especially the recent one about the &pound;5,000 that was  spent to put up 17 health chiefs for two night&rsquo;s accommodation in a County Antrim  hotel that was only down the road.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Is that value for money? What is the value for money  process, and who ensures that value for money is obtained? Who has the final  say in making decisions about training courses? We can be sure that the  Department&rsquo;s permanent secretary does not have the last call. As we all know,  the permanent secretary sent a memo to the Department&rsquo;s agencies instructing  them to exercise restraint when considering training courses. That instruction  does not appear to have been followed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Training courses are necessary, and looking to best  practice and international expertise is no bad thing. The question is whether  there is value for our Health Service. Tommy Gallagher mentioned the nurses&rsquo;  letter that was quoted in a recent article in &lsquo;The Irish News&rsquo;. That was a true  reflection of the experiences of front line nursing staff and how they feel  such courses benefit them. The nurses said that they were insulted by the ideas  that came back from some of those international training courses, such as  wearing different-coloured aprons. Such ideas are at the core of basic nursing  skills and the nurses did not need anyone to travel halfway around the world to  tell them that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion calls for a review of spending on senior  salaries, which is absolutely relevant in the current economic context. The  issue of bonuses, or to keep the Minister happy, &ldquo;clinical excellence awards&rdquo;,  has often been raised in the House. During last week&rsquo;s debate on domiciliary  care, the Minister claimed that my colleague Martina Anderson was confused by  the amount of money that was paid out by the Health Department and queried her  claim that &pound;57 million had been paid out; but Martina was not confused and  neither am I. Fifty-seven million pounds over the past five years is exactly  what the Health Department has paid out.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister often refers to the savings that the Health  Department has made. He says that he has saved &pound;53 million through RPA, and  that the Health Department is the only one that has implemented RPA. However,  one hand is saving money while the other is paying it out. I expect that the  Minister will say that no new awards are being made this year because there is  a review, but that does not mean that the awards that are already in place will  not continue to be paid.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member must bring her remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Those amounts will continue to be paid because once someone is awarded an  amount of money in a bonus it sits for five years without review. Is that value  for money?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  A stark reality faces health and social care in Northern Ireland: by the end of the  Budget 2010 period, it will take &pound;5&middot;4 billion a year to provide a safe and  fit-for-purpose Health Service. That is &pound;1&middot;1 billion more than in the current  Budget before &mdash; and I emphasise before &mdash; any cuts are made. There must also be  a note of realism about the number of efficiencies that can be achieved;  listing them is not enough.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is also unfair to ignore the significant savings that  the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety (DHSSPS) has  already made. It is a fact, for instance, that that Department has reduced the  number of its administrative staff by almost 1,500, while the number of senior  executives has been cut by 57%. Those significant staff reductions will ensure  that some &pound;49 million in savings will be released each year from April 2011.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I recently asked all Ministers how many staff they employed  who earned more than &pound;100,000. I had the sense to realise that although there  were more than 900 people in that category in the Health Department, most were  clinicians who were paid at normal national rates and that only a small  percentage were administrators. Naturally, I asked the Health Minister to  clarify the issue for me, as I realised that the Health Department was unlike  others in that respect. The Minister told me that 917 staff were paid more than  &pound;100,000 a year, not the 934 quoted by others and that of those just 10 &mdash; 1% &mdash;  were non-clinical.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clinical staff are, of course, paid at nationally agreed  rates. That puts into perspective the earlier scare stories, issued by the DUP,  that hundreds of staff are on over &pound;100,000 a year. In the DHSSPS, those are  largely not administrative staff. Maybe the DUP could, in future, take the  trouble to check its facts before engaging in cheap and easy headlines.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As far as the vulnerable are concerned, there has already  been action. The new Independent Safeguarding Authority (ISA) has been  established. It will register those who work with children and vulnerable  adults and maintain lists of those who are barred from such work on the basis  of harm or the risk of harm. A requirement has been established for paid and  unpaid employees who work in specified positions to register with the ISA and  pay a registration fee. Therefore, the improvements that the motion calls for  are already well in train, and I ask the House to take note of that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I support the motion. Scarce resources in any Department have to be used  wisely, and, in this case, given that we are talking about vulnerable people,  every effort must be made to ensure that funds find their way into front line  services.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Travelling to work this morning, I was totally disgusted to  listen to the pleas of parents whose youngsters live with very serious and  life-threatening illnesses. They have been asking for more help from the  Children&rsquo;s Hospice. When one hears those heart-rending real-life stories,  resources must surely be directed to where they are urgently needed. I also  heard a chief of the hospice talk this morning about how its funding falls far  short of what similar bodies across the water receive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Health Department must pay attention to what is  required, rather than spending money on luxury trips and luxury hotels. Indeed,  all we have heard in recent times from the local media and newspapers is how  much cash is used on items away from what will actually deliver a first-class  Health Service, particularly, as the motion states, care services for  vulnerable people. It is incumbent on those who run the Health Service to be  prudent at all times.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic" align="center" style="text-align:center;">(Mr Deputy  Speaker [Mr McClarty] in the Chair)</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I watched the Health Committee inquisition of senior civil  servants last week. While the officials answered the many questions, I was not  convinced that lessons have been learned. However, I appeal to the Minister &mdash; I  am glad that he is with us today &mdash; to ensure that efficiencies are made in  every corner or wherever they can be made, and that money is not wasted but put  into the care of our most vulnerable people. That is what today&rsquo;s motion is  about, and I fully support it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Girvan</strong>: I  support the motion as presented. However, in doing so, I appreciate that we are  working in a climate of ever-reducing budgets, and I very much understand that  we need to get value for money from all areas. Given that health is very  important, it is vital that we do that and deliver money to the areas where it  is most needed and to people who maybe do not have a voice to shout or lobby  for resources themselves.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In saying that, I know that the block grant is probably  being used as an opportunity to focus in on waste and on areas where money is  not necessarily being used correctly. I put the blame directly where it  belongs: with the Tories and the Lib Dems. They are both represented in the  Chamber by parties that have spoken in today&rsquo;s debate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is vital that we make proper use of that resource, and  all Members who have spoken have identified that certain moneys have not  necessarily been used effectively.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate that civil servants from the Health Department  have to attend some training courses because that will benefit their jobs, but,  given that &pound;360,000 was spent on overseas trips, a business case needs to be  made to assess whether that stacks up. Councils were mentioned earlier, and, at  councils, many such trips are classed as junkets. I do not class all of them as  junkets; I appreciate that there is benefit from some conferences, but, in the  case of some trips, I question the reports and the benefits that have been  brought back to Northern    Ireland. We have the opportunity to run  training courses in the Province at the same level as they are run elsewhere,  and we can bring others here to deliver courses.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We should ensure that people can get an appointment at  their GP, and, if they are going for an outpatient appointment or elective  surgery, that they will not have to wait for months. Considering the size of  the budget, we have to make proper use of the resource available. Irrespective  of the size of a Department&rsquo;s budget, there are bound to be areas in which  savings can be made. I appreciate that the Minister will say that savings have  been made, and I congratulate him for that, but there are areas on which we  must put the focus and the searchlight and ensure that we can extract and make  the best use of money.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Targeting people who are vulnerable is one of the areas  that we need to make use of. Who do we class as the vulnerable? It is the  people who do not have the opportunity to speak for themselves. Last week, we  had a debate on domiciliary care, which is a forgotten area in that, in many  cases, once people are out of the hospital, they are forgotten about. We need  to focus on those areas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion, and I know &mdash; and I hope and pray &mdash;  that the Minister will take on board that we are still not satisfied with the  cuts and the savings that have been made. It was mentioned yesterday that  &pound;210,000 will be saved by the cut in the number of neurology beds from 23 to  16. If &pound;210,000 were identified and used correctly, it could make a big  difference. I am not necessarily talking about cutting but about making use of  the money more effectively.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: As this is the first occasion on which the House will hear from Mr  P&oacute;l Callaghan, I remind the House that it is the convention that a maiden  speech is made without interruption.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Seo mo ch&eacute;ad &oacute;r&aacute;id sa Teach ar r&uacute;n  a bhaineann leis an ch&oacute;ras sl&aacute;inte. Mar a deirtear go minic i bP&aacute;irc an  Chr&oacute;caigh, t&aacute; an-&aacute;thas orm seasamh anseo mar Chomhalta Tion&oacute;il SDLP don  Fheabhail in &aacute;it Mark Durkan.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for this opportunity to  address the House for my maiden speech, particularly on this motion regarding  the Health Service. I am honoured to stand here as an SDLP Assembly Member for  the Foyle constituency, replacing Mark Durkan.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In this House, we have a duty to improve the lives of the  people whom we serve. My predecessor fulfilled that role diligently during his  12 years elected to serve in the House. Given the motion, I am particularly  mindful of his efforts to improve the health and social care available to  people in Derry and across the region. Not  least, I recall his efforts to secure the south wing for Altnagelvin  Hospital, the Clinical Translational  Research and Innovation Centre (C-TRIC) at Altnagelvin  Hospital and the regional cancer  centre at Belfast City Hospital,  which serves the whole of Northern    Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Members know, behind the big headlines and major  projects lies the important constituency caseload, day in and day out. Nowhere  is that more important than in health and social care matters, and I intend to  carry on the high standard of constituency service and policy advocacy that my  predecessor carried out for the Foyle constituents.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Deputy Speaker, t&aacute; m&eacute; f&iacute;orbhr&oacute;d&uacute;il seasamh anseo romhat  mar Chonallach ag obair ar son mhuintir Dhoire.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As someone from Donegal, I am very proud to work on behalf  of the people of Derry, which, of course, was  established by an O&rsquo;Donnell prince, St Colmcille. It is fitting that I speak on  St Andrew&rsquo;s Day, given Saint Columba&rsquo;s special role in forming the affinity  between Ireland and Scotland. I  understand that, on St Andrew&rsquo;s Day, it is traditional in parts of Scotland for  comely maidens in pursuit of a husband to throw their shoes at the doors of  men. I am happy, however, to assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the laces on  my boots will remain firmly tied for today at least.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A LeasCheann Comhairle, as a visitor and a county man, you  will need no reminder of the wonderful nature of Derry  and its people. Once peripheral, the city has been put at the centre of the  digital world by Project Kelvin, and we look forward with excitement to Derry as the City of Culture 2013.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I now turn to the motion, which follows on from extensive  coverage in recent weeks of the amounts spent on overseas trips: post hoc ergo  propter hoc. Members may turn to Google for a translation; it is beyond my  capacity.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I worked in the Health Service for a time, and I know the  vocational dedication and professionalism of the overwhelming number of people  who deliver our health and social care services. They deliver compassionate and  professional treatment and care to the public. The motion does not target them;  rather, it is about ensuring that the system delivers resources to the people  who count at the front line and to those who provide essential services to  them. The motion seeks better management in trusts, in the board and in the  Assembly. That requires partnership between us all where possible and challenge  when needed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion calls for a review of senior salaries in the  Health Service. We all know that circumstances are not what they were three  years ago. People today want a professional of high calibre to lead the Health  Service, but they also want to be reassured that pay and conditions are  benchmarked against standards that are relevant to today&rsquo;s fiscal climate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As a new member of the Health Committee, I was concerned to  learn that no uniform standard of categorising management cost appears to exist  across the trusts. MLAs are guardians of the public purse, but how are we to  know how trusts are performing when transparently accountable figures are not  available to us? I was also worried that some trusts seem unable to provide  specific job titles for band-8 managers. The Assembly must evaluate those  matters: how can MLAs in Committee or otherwise drill down into public spending  when such information is not available to us? The issue is about confidence and  about trusts&rsquo; ability to demonstrate that resources are being properly  directed. I trust that the Minister will take action to address that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Like other Members, I acknowledge that some training can be  secured from overseas only. However, there must be evidence &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should draw his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  I am sorry, Mr Deputy Speaker. I thought that I had five minutes in which to  speak.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Front line training for essential clinical skills should be  given priority. I am reminded of the story of the Fisher Company in the US that  invested $1 million to develop a space pen when the Russians simply used  pencils. In today&rsquo;s environment, we need to show that we are spending only what  we need to spend.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Time is up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I support the motion. I will try to  refrain from throwing my shoes at the Minister or at anyone else today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The core message is that the provision of services for  vulnerable people should be of the highest quality and available for those most  in need. It is important that those services be promoted and accessible.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive have agreed that procurement policy  principles should be guided by a clear definition of public procurement and of  the concept of best value for money. Best value for money is defined as the  optimum combination of whole-life costs and quality to meet customers&rsquo;  requirements. It is a procurement specification that includes social, economic  and environmental policy objectives. Twelve guiding principles govern the  administration of public procurement: accountability, competitive supply,  consistency, effectiveness, efficiency, fair dealing, integration, integrity,  informed decision-making, legality, responsiveness, and transparency. It is  important that those principles were adopted and continue to be put into  practice in the Health Service.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As a fairly new member of the Health Committee, I found it  informative and interesting to hear the permanent secretary of the Department  and some of the trusts&rsquo; chief executives explaining how their salaries were  justifiable and provided value for money. Many of their answers were based on  the premise that their posts carry a huge degree of responsibility. That is  undoubtedly true, but front line staff also have a large degree of  responsibility when dealing with their clients, and, like me, they may have  some difficulty in reconciling the large gaps in remuneration that are  prevalent in the Heath Service.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The top administrators also had no problem in justifying  the outlays for travel and training. I am sure that those courses can be  necessary and valuable and, as was explained, provide savings in the long-term.  However, the accommodation costs and the nature of travel need to be looked at  and savings put in place. Perhaps it is just that those issues were never  really questioned or looked at before, but it is now time to do so.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In any large bureaucracy, there is a degree of waste that  can be dealt with. However, perhaps more effort could be employed in the Health  Service in looking at areas in which savings can be achieved. The provision of  proper care and services for vulnerable people must be paramount. I sincerely  hope that the Minister will take all this on board and regard it as  constructive criticism. Vulnerable people need and deserve a Health Service  that works for them, and that is a view shared by the vast majority of Health  Service staff.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: Some of my  remarks will refer to vulnerable people, who are, after all, at the crux of the  motion. Many Members have spoken about everything other than vulnerable people,  and they often end up at the bottom of folk&rsquo;s lists.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For most vulnerable people in society, such as elderly  people, children and those with learning difficulties or mental-health  problems, the crucial principle is the core principle of the Health Service,  which is that health and social care is free at the point of delivery. Every  year, the Health Service cares for thousands of vulnerable people. For the  benefit of Members: the facts speak for themselves. We provide 14 million  domiciliary care hours. Those hours have not been reduced; I have seen to that  over the past three years, and the Department&rsquo;s spend on elderly people&rsquo;s  services and domiciliary care packages continues to rise. The Department has  also provided 1&middot;4 million meals to clients&rsquo; homes; over 650,000 weeks of  nursing and residential care; 66,000 day care attendances in learning  disability hospitals; and 32,000 day care attendances for mental-health  patients. Furthermore, more than 22,500 children have been referred to social  services. Those are some of the statistics that show the nature of the need and  the demand. The Health Service meets that demand, and the spend on mental health,  learning disabilities and other areas is increasing. My budget is being  severely constrained, and I will talk a little bit about that in a moment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Northern Ireland  has the fastest growing elderly population in the UK. Over 250,000 men and women in the  population are over the age of 65. By 2030, the ratio will have increased to  almost one in four, with almost 83,000 people over the age of 85. The spend on  elderly care in Northern    Ireland is second only to the spend on acute  care, and it runs to approximately &pound;700 million per annum. A rising life  expectancy rate brings with it the increasing risk of a number of diseases,  such as arthritis, cancer, diabetes, stroke and dementia, that are associated  with old age. We should all be thankful that people are living longer because  it demonstrates that the Health Service is working. However, it is key that we  provide quality extra years for our vulnerable population. As Minister, I have  sought to do that over the past number of years, and I have invested in the  Cinderella services that care for those with mental-health problems and  learning disabilities. I have also worked hard and increased the spend on  children at risk and to support families, and I have ensured that care packages  are put in place to support those children.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I know that Members like to refer to the spend on  domiciliary care and other areas being reduced, but the reality is that the  spend in each of the areas that I outlined is rising, as is the number of  patients and clients that we support. However, demand is also rising as least  as fast.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members spent a lot of time talking about various issues,  some of which I will address. As far as RPA is concerned, we are reducing  administrative staff by 1,700 and saving &pound;53 million per annum. We are doing  something that other Departments are not doing and signally failing to do. We  are on target to achieve that by the end of the comprehensive spending review  (CSR) period. Management costs for the Health Service in Northern Ireland,  as a percentage, are the lowest of all the home countries.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Craig &mdash; I am sorry that he has left &mdash; quoted a figure  for some year in which management costs appeared to rise. However, at that  time, we had to deal with Agenda for Change, which back paid our staff to 2004.  Therefore, it appears that spend increased in some years when, in fact, the  real cost actually decreased. We have reduced the numbers of trusts from 19 to  six, health boards from four to one and senior executives from 188 to 80. That  is also reflected in the numbers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mrs O&rsquo;Neill talked about the cost of managers. Mrs O&rsquo;Neill  is an advocate of a united Ireland.  Senior executives in the health service in the Irish  Republic are paid approximately double  what senior executives are paid in Northern Ireland. That is another  important point. Mr Craig referred to hundreds of staff on salaries of between  &pound;50,000 and &pound;100,000. I can confirm that most of those are clinicians, just as  those who earn more than &pound;100,000 per annum are consultants.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mrs O&rsquo;Neill also raised her old red herring of the clinical  excellence awards. We have national pay deals for our doctors, nurses and,  indeed, the overwhelming majority of our Health Service staff. Those pay deals  are set by negotiations in London.  We deliver those, whatever they are. The clinical excellence awards scheme is  part of the pay rate for consultants. I asked for that scheme to be reviewed  some time ago, but the previous Labour Government in London did not want to undertake a review.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: No, I am talking. Thank you.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The new Government in London  are prepared to review the clinical excellence awards, and that will now happen  with the support of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The clinical  excellence awards are part and parcel of the pay awards. They are characterised  as bonuses, but they are not bonuses. They are rates of pay. Consultants&rsquo; pay  differentials are determined by the so-called clinical excellence that each  consultant brings to a particular task. We have some top-quality consultants in  Northern Ireland  who bring cutting-edge improvements to their care.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Travel is another hoary chestnut. We spend &pound;30 million a  year on travel. Most of that goes to doctors, nurses, social services workers  and other staff, who get paid as they travel about the community doing their  work. In the same way as MLAs &mdash; such as Mr Gallagher, who travels from the far  side of Fermanagh &mdash; are paid per mile, Health Service staff are also entitled  to be reimbursed. That is where that money goes. We also use taxis on  occasions. Taxis are used not least to transport patients such as vulnerable  children who require protection and are not able to use public transport  because of the risk of domestic violence and so on. Members throw out lines  that we use taxis and use this and that. However, taxis are cheaper and more  appropriate in many cases. There are reasons for all this.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, pay increases and bonuses are set centrally in London; they are national  pay awards.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Perhaps I will let you come in  shortly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to talk about Mrs O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s aprons and value for  money. The &pound;350,000 that we spent on the Northern Ireland Safety Forum was  almost the sole topic of an article in a local newspaper. I am not accountable  to a newspaper; I am accountable to the House.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The figures that I will read were reported to the Health  Committee, but I will read them again. The savings in on-site infections are  estimated to be &pound;1&middot;9 million through a 54% reduction in the number of cases of  infection; on central line infections, which are a major cause of injury, one  hospital saved more than &pound;900,000 in one year; another saved more than &pound;200,000  in one year by reducing instances of ventilator associated pneumonia.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Integrated medications management concerns nurses who go  round wards handing out medicines to patients. Over the course of a shift, one  of those nurses will be contacted on 100 occasions as she goes about her work  on a ward. The apron sends out the message that the nurse who is wearing it  cannot be spoken to. The nurse who has the trolley of medicines is the one who  everybody talks to and interrupts. Due to those interruptions, some patients  get their medicines twice while others miss theirs; mistakes are made and  patients come to harm. One trust in one year saved more than &pound;400,000 by  eliminating drugs waste and reducing the amount of time required for a nurse to  go round with the medicines through a simple device identifying the medicines  nurse.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There have been a number of savings. The &pound;350,000 per annum  was spent out of the budget of &pound;30 million because it has provided real safety  benefits.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The other issue was senior nurses and whistle-blowers.  Health Service policy requires staff to blow a whistle; in other words, to  point the finger and highlight and publicise any unsafe practices that they  see. That is not just a policy: staff who witness unsafe practices have a duty  to report them and are required to come forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The 12 senior nurses, out of a total of 16,000 nurses, who  put their names on an anonymous letter have been talked of as a good authority.  Those nurses are required to report unsafe practice. I only wish that they  would write to or contact me, because that would allow me to do something about  it. Such anonymous letters are of little help.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I listened to Members&rsquo; concerns about management. My  Department is the only one to implement RPA; I wonder why other Departments  have not done so. I have asked my officials to carry out a post-implementation  review of the new management structures under RPA. That is important. With the  number of reductions and the management that we are using, it is important to  ensure that the design of management in the new trust &mdash; the new configuration &mdash;  is appropriate and is working properly. I hope that that will help to address  the issue around management.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Procurement practice is another issue that was in the  motion but was not actually raised by Members. I have set up a business  services organisation to centralise procurement. We also follow strict  procurement practices as far as the Health Service is concerned and as far as  Government are concerned. I have spoken about travel, but it is also important  to refer to training.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We spend about &pound;150 million on training every year, most of  which goes on doctors, nurses and dentists. There is a large training budget,  and one is tempted to stop the training, but that would only starve the Health  Service for the future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those are the issues in the motion, and I have tried to  address them. Tackling site safety has shown real benefits and reductions in  cost. However, now that the issue comes under the remit of the Public Health  Agency, a body that I set up a couple of years ago, I am asking that it ensures  that it maximises value for money.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The real issue is not waste; in such a huge organisation  there will always be areas of waste. However, as we find those areas, we will  eliminate them. The real issue is that of the budget. I think that it was Mr  Girvan who said that the proper use of the resources that we have will do. No,  they will not; not by a long, long way. I have said that in the House over and  over again. Until Members address the key issue that, if the Health Service  does not have enough resources, it will not be able to manage the need as it  presents itself. Therefore, we will not have the British Health Service as we  understand it &mdash; cradle-to-the-grave healthcare that is free at the point of  delivery &mdash; and we will be looking at a radical redesign of services and a large  number of redundancies.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I said that in the House in the past, and I will say it  again, and I am not talking about a few hundred job losses. As I look into the  future, as things stand, I am talking about thousands of potential job losses  and the inability of a number of sites to continue to provide services. We face  a radical change to services.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">By all means, Members should maintain a sharp focus on  waste, because that helps me as I seek to make the Health Service as efficient  and effective as I possibly can. However, Members must also focus on the need  for a resource that pays for, runs and manages our Health Service. Currently,  we are &pound;640 million pro rata behind England  in our attempt to run a Health Service that is comparable with the rest of the UK.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Minister to draw his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: That gap is now likely to grow,  and, as it grows, there will be further pain and distress. Currently, Members  experience problems when their constituents complain about the lack of  provision to address their needs &mdash; that is only the beginning.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I am pleased to make a  winding-up speech in this important debate. I thank my colleague Tommy  Gallagher for proposing the motion and for bringing it before the House.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Tommy mentioned that we live in harsh, tough financial and  economic times. He said that the public were right to ask questions about how  the health budget was being allocated. He said that cuts affect the weak and  vulnerable weekly, and I can attest to that from my experience in my  constituency. Just last week, I received a phone call from a blind person who,  until then, had been receiving help with the preparation of meals. That person  had been informed that the help was being withdrawn. For the life of me, I  cannot see how the withdrawal of that help constitutes a more effective service  that addresses a front line need &mdash; it is the opposite. There are bean counters  somewhere who cannot see the effect of their actions on people on the ground.  That is what we need to be concerned about. As the Minister said, the point of  delivery is the important point.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Tommy also said that the SDLP will not support the  ring-fencing of the health budget until it is assured that the wastage in the  system is being kept to a minimum and that, in the end, it will be eradicated.  His point on the spending on travel for senior management and administrators  was echoed by several speakers. Mr Gallagher also mentioned the questions asked  by senior nurses about foreign travel for training and about whether there was  any benefit from that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister said that there is a culture of  whistle-blowing in the Health Service. I do not get that impression. I get the  impression that there is a culture of gagging and that people who work in the  Health Service are, in fact, afraid to come forward and tell the truth about  what is really happening. They feel the need to hide behind a cloak of  anonymity before they can reveal the truth. That is not a culture of openness  and free speech; it is a culture of gagging to ensure that the truth remains  hidden.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It is the duty of the Minister and of everyone in  the House to ensure that that type of culture ends and that the people who work  in public services, be it the Health Service or any other public service, feel  confident to come forward and tell what is really happening.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Quite often, as public representatives, we hear the  official line from officials, but it is only when we drill down to the front  line that we find out the truth about what is happening. It is valuable to us  as public representatives to be made aware of what is happening at, as the  Minister said, the point of delivery, because that is where the service  matters. It does not matter in a Committee room here; it matters where it is  delivered to the people who pay for it &mdash; the general public. Therefore, I doubt  the Minister&rsquo;s assertion that there is a free whistle-blowing culture in the  Health Service. To me, the opposite seems true. Perhaps the Minister might take  the time to think about that and address that to ensure that the culture of  openness that we all want to see there is developed, so that people are not  afraid to come forward and tell us what is really happening.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Jonathan Craig spoke of the information that he had ascertained  from the Department regarding the number of people in receipt of salaries of  over &pound;50,000. If my memory serves me right, he said that there were 2,492. That  is an astonishing figure. When the Minister conducts his review, perhaps he  will look into that. Mr Craig also said that the RPA had saved &pound;5&middot;6 million but  costs had risen to &pound;120 million. He asked the Minister to revisit that issue.  He said that he was astonished by the amount of money being spent on taxis: &pound;1  million in the Southern Trust area and &pound;500,000 in the Western Trust area. The  Minister said that that money was spent on taxis for vulnerable children, but  he did not reply to the question of foreign travel. The Minister issued a  directive to his staff telling them to carefully scrutinise the money that was  being spent on training and travel, including foreign training and travel. The  question that arises is whether the Minister&rsquo;s directive is being abided by. It  seems to me and to many in the House that the Minister&rsquo;s directive has been ignored.  That is something that the Minister must address. If he issues a directive to  his staff, surely his staff should abide by it. It seems that that is not the  case here.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Would the Member put a ban on foreign travel, given his earlier comments that  he would support ring-fencing of health only when all the wastage had been  removed? What percentage of administration costs would he consider that to be?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  I thank the Member for his intervention. If he had been listening, he would have  heard me say that the Minister issued a directive about training and travel,  and I am asking the Minister to ensure that his directive is implemented.  Surely the Member will agree with me that that is not too much to ask.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Would you put a ban on it?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  If you had been here at the beginning, you would have heard Mr Gallagher &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. I will not accept references from a sedentary position.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  As I was saying, Mr McCallister, if you had had enough interest as a member of  the Health Committee to be here at the beginning of the debate, you would have  heard Mr Gallagher say that he was not in favour of a ban.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I was attending a Health Committee  event in the Long Gallery. Perhaps if the Member had had enough interest, he  would have taken a note of what was on.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: That is not a point of order, but your point has been made.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  It is not a point of order. However, Mrs O&rsquo;Neill, who is a member of the Health  Committee, mentioned that an event was taking place in the Long Gallery, yet  she was present to speak in the debate. I do not fault the Member for attending  the event. I am just making the point that he was not here and, therefore, did  not hear what I said earlier.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. The Member is wandering slightly from the subject of the debate.  I ask him to return to the subject matter.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  I will return to the subject of the debate quite willingly. You will agree with  me, Mr Deputy Speaker, that it was, in fact, Mr McCallister who strayed from  the subject of the debate, not me.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In any case, to return to the subject of the debate,  Michelle O&rsquo;Neill said that, in her role as Mayor of Dungannon, she had recently  attended an event at which people with disabilities were present. They told her  that their feeling was that their services were being cut back and they were  not valued by the system. That is the response that many MLAs get on this  issue. The Minister needs to look more closely at that. Often, he simply hears  from his officials. He does not get to the point of delivery in order to be  aware of what really happens. That is what he needs to do.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Michelle O&rsquo;Neill mentioned that &pound;5,000 had been spent on  accommodation in a County   Antrim hotel. She said  that we must ask whether that is value for money. I am sure that we would all  join her in asking that question: is that value for money? There is only one  answer: no; it is not value for money. The Minister needs to ensure that value  for money is achieved. His comments have not convinced me that he is sure of  that. I hope that, in light of what has been said in the debate, he takes the  opportunity to look again at the issues mentioned in the motion, to ensure that  wastage in the system is kept to a minimum and that money spent on training and  travel is absolutely essential and of benefit to the system. Go raibh m&iacute;le  maith agat.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly expresses concern at the ongoing reduction  in essential health and social care services for vulnerable people; calls on  the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to tackle wastage  within his Department and its agencies; and further calls on the Minister to  undertake a review of (i) spending on senior salaries, (ii) spending on travel  and accommodation for senior management and administrators, and (iii)  procurement practices within health and social care trusts.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Motion made:</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Assembly do now adjourn. &mdash; [Mr Deputy Speaker.]</p>
    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="i"></a>Adjournment</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Home-Start: Ards   Peninsula and Comber</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind Members that the proposer of the topic for debate will  have 15 minutes in which to speak. All other Members will have approximately 10  minutes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  More than anything that I could say on the subject, a letter that I have  received from Home-Start speaks for itself. Indeed, it speaks volumes for the  work that Home-Start does, its volunteers&rsquo; commitment and its staff&rsquo;s devotion.  Above all, it accurately identifies the need that exists in the Ards Peninsula  and Comber area to keep Home-Start in business. The letter states:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I am writing to you on a matter of great urgency to  families in your constituency. Home-Start in Northern Ireland provides  much-needed support to parents and children. The support is required because  too many parents live only one event away from a crisis through coping with  illness, isolation, poverty, poor access to the health care and local services,  or because of the devastating loss or absence of another parent. Home-Start is  a community safety net, providing vital support that can help move these  fragile families into strong families, giving children the opportunity to  thrive. These valuable services are under threat in your constituent area and  we urgently need you to help to protect them.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">In recent days, politicians, journalists and others  have spoken about the threat to front line services. Those families are at the  front line.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Funding provided by the Department of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety, which finishes in March 2011, enabled Home-Start in  the Ards Peninsula and Comber area to run a  volunteer-led home visit service for families with young children who are under  stress. DHSSPS funding for the scheme to support families in the Ards, Comber,  Ballygowan and Killinchy areas was &pound;37,000 in 2009-2010 and &pound;39,000 in 2010-11.  The current funding runs until March 2011.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The ethos of Home-Start is early intervention and  prevention. The letter goes on to state:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Current research indicates that early intervention is  far less costly than trying to deal with more complex issues that can lead to  children being placed at risk and taken into care. This can save various  Departments a significant amount of money. Home-Start can support 40 families  for the cost of placing one child in care. It is believed that every &pound;1that is  spent on early intervention will save the Government &pound;7 in the future. Our  services will therefore save the Executive significant money.</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">A total loss of funding for this scheme of &pound;40,000  approximately means that it could cost the Government &pound;280,000 in the future.  Whilst these funds are very small in terms of departmental budgets, every penny  counts towards supporting families. It is our belief that this move will mean  families will face even greater hardship at this economically challenging time  and will, in turn, cost Departments more money in the provision of other more  expensive forms of support.</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">I am sure that you can appreciate that the loss of  funding presents us with the difficulties that challenge the whole ethos of our  work and are contrary to our belief in early intervention as the best option  for children and families. If this funding is lost, and Home-Start Ards, Comber  and Peninsula Area is forced to close, with the loss of support to around 110  to 120 families, there will be no support for parents who have multiple  problems to do with child protection, mental health, disabilities, drug and  alcohol abuse, multiple births, deprivation, hardship and domestic violence.</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">The funding received from DHSSPS represents around 40  to 60 families being supported for approximately &pound;40,000 in Newtownards,  Comber, Ballygowan and Killinchy. There are no other family support  organisations supporting young families in the Newtownards areas covering the  same need. The remainder of the 40 to 60 families are currently being funded  via Sure Start to cover the lower half of the Ards peninsula area only. That is  reviewed on a yearly basis, and it is not guaranteed.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the letter, Home-Start outlines the potential impact on  families in my constituency, and it presents the 2009-2010 statistics for  Home-Start Ards, Comber and Peninsula Area. It states:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The total number of families supported was 114; the  total number of parents supported was 196; and the total number of children  supported was 256. The total number of children who will be deprived of  services, which is 256, will be deprived should the scheme close, and at least  50% will be deprived if there is no further funding for the most important of  all, the families that are in the Ards, Comber, Ballygowan and Killinchy areas.  They will not have any family support service from us. Sure Start, whose  services are not the same as ours covers only one ward in Newtownards, which is  the Scrabo ward.</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">We hope, Mr McNarry, that this indicates to you the  massive impact a small amount of funding can make and how vital it is that our  services are not threatened. The London  School of Economics reported that the  cost to the United Kingdom  of failing to look after vulnerable children was in excess of &pound;10 billion. That  is money that the United Kingdom  Government and the Northern    Ireland Executive cannot afford to lose.</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">We would ask you to lobby Ministers at the Executive  table to ensure that these services are not threatened, so that families on the  front line can find life slightly easier. This will be crucial in the tough  times ahead. At present, volunteering in the community is being widely  promoted, especially with the over-50s. This results in huge savings, as well  as in promoting mental health and well-being for both volunteers and the  beneficiaries.</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">However, the volunteers cannot support anyone without  the backup of training, Access NI checks, travel expenses and ongoing support.  This does not come free. What we would really like you to do is put a question  in the Assembly about early intervention and the importance of this in order to  save money.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is what the letter says.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The letter says that I should put a question:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;about early intervention and the importance of this  in order to save money.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Mr Deputy Speaker, thanks to you and to the system  that we operate, that is precisely what I am doing. I am asking the Minister to  rescue Home-Start in my constituency of Strangford. I realise that it is a  mighty ask, but he, like me, makes judgement calls. Mine in this case is to  support that call from Home-Start, because I believe in and am aware of its  good work and of the results that it achieves. I appreciate that the Minister&rsquo;s  role is to juggle funding. He has the most difficult task of all the Ministers  in that juggling act. I know that in his juggling, not everyone can be  satisfied. However, my judgement call today is going further, and, even though  I cannot reach him, I am using this opportunity to twist his arm to squeeze  something extra out of his budget.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We both know that his Department has written to Home-Start  advising that its current funding arrangements would be reviewed as part of the  forthcoming spending review, the outcome of which would be known in the autumn,  and that, therefore, nothing could be guaranteed to Home-Start about future  funding at this stage. The autumn has passed, and I suspect that the winter  will pass also. It will then be springtime before the spending  review-cum-revised Budget will either be agreed or not agreed. The funding I am  anxious to secure at the moment is a minimum small amount of &pound;40,000 for  families in the Comber, Ballygowan and Killinchy area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I know, because I live there. I know the need that exists,  and I know the work that goes on there. It really is not the families&rsquo; fault,  and they should not be punished or deprived of funds that are required to help  them. I know that the Minister has no intention of punishing anyone; it is not  in his character. However, those are the words that must be used in this  debate, because that is the impact that is felt. It feels as though it is a  punishment of those people for something they are not guilty of. As I  indicated, I understand, perhaps more than most, the Minister&rsquo;s situation.  However, it is close to Christmas, and it is a special time for all families.  My duty is to press the Minister, as I am doing today, and to keep pressing him  until he says yes. That is what I am doing.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I want to begin by congratulating my constituency colleague Mr McNarry on  securing the time to discuss this important subject. I know that it is close to  his heart and that it will resonate far and wide in the Strangford  constituency. After Mr McNarry gave such a good rundown of the work of  Home-Start, it will be difficult to add anything about the value that I and  others and, more importantly, the people of our area place on the services that  Home-Start delivers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the time allotted to me, I simply want to echo  everything that Mr McNarry said and to underscore the importance of the service  delivered by Home-Start, principally in the Ards Peninsula  and Comber areas. All of us who know the work that it does admire the standard  of the service that it delivers, particularly the fact that a lot of it is  delivered by volunteers. Sometimes we forget that. We see organisations, and we  think that everybody who is delivering a service through that organisation is  receiving a wage for doing so. However, that is not the case in so many of our  organisations. I think that we would want to put on record our thanks to those  in Home-Start and, indeed, in other community and voluntary organisations in  our constituency and further afield in Northern Ireland for the great work  that they do day in, day out. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that work often  goes without recognition.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For me, the critical point in the argument put forward by  Mr McNarry relates to the cost of keeping a child in care. Let us face it: some  of the children who are looked after through Home-Start may, if life&rsquo;s events  take a different turn, end up in care. The cost of keeping a child in care would  run to approximately &pound;2,500 a week. Home-Start is saying that it can provide  its services to prevent those children getting caught in that downward spiral,  and it can offer its services to around 40 children for the same amount of  money. We always want to prevent problems. It is easy to throw money at dealing  with the problem at the end; it is much more difficult to prevent the problem  developing, but that is where we should be increasingly focusing all our  resources. This is a perfect example of where that can be successful.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Among my constituency colleagues who unfortunately cannot  be here, Michelle McIlveen, particularly through her role as children and young  persons spokesman for the party, has taken a keen interest in the subject and  has written to and lobbied the Minister on behalf of our party. The same  situation prevails in Ballynahinch, where there is a campaign to preserve the  Home-Start service. Jim Shannon, now the MP for that area, has taken an active  role in trying to bring to the Minister&rsquo;s attention the importance of the  service delivered in that area. The problem exists not just in one part of  Strangford; it is in that new bit of Strangford as well.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This is not the first time that the issue has been debated  or discussed in the House, and it may not be the last. I hope that it is the  last. Like Mr McNarry, I acknowledge that the Minister faces exceptional  challenges now and into the future. Indeed, whoever succeeds him as Health  Minister will face equally difficult challenges when it comes to administering  the budget. The crisis that we face puts additional pressures on all services,  particularly on the sort of services delivered by Home-Start. However, the  issue is not necessarily how much funding is received by Home-Start in Ards; it  is the certainty of that funding. We have been here before. A lack of ongoing  funding has caused this problem at this time of the year, as it does for so  many organisations across Northern    Ireland, because there is no certainty  moving forward. For me, the issue is trying to drive some certainty into the  situation, as opposed to establishing exactitude on the amount of funding that  will be received.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The budgetary challenges that we face, which are immense,  create opportunities to look not only at what services we will continue to  deliver but at who will deliver them and how they will be delivered. Models  such as that presented by Home-Start give us an opportunity to look at how  others outside what might be perceived as the orthodoxy of the public sector  can deliver exemplary standards of service, dealing with some of the most  vulnerable people in our society and, as is so often the case, as with this  example, at a much reduced cost to the public purse.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My real concern, which I know is shared by others, is that,  if Home-Start does not deliver the services that it is delivering in our area,  I do not know who will. The short-term saving of the tens of thousands of  pounds that go to Home-Start every year may create a long-term cost. That may  be difficult to measure precisely, but it is a truism that savings in the short  term will be more than balanced out by long-term costs, if that early  intervention is not there.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not want to repeat myself, but I know that the  Minister faces difficult challenges. As we know, there is no Budget at this  stage. Work is ongoing to deal with that, and, obviously, the Minister is not  in a position to give us any certitude today, even if he wanted to. Echoing  what Mr McNarry said, all I ask of him is that, when that Budget is finalised  and he has a better handle on what his finances will be for the next number of  years, he will give careful and, hopefully, preferable consideration to the  cause that was so ably put forward by Mr McNarry. I echo what he said, and I  know that it will be echoed by colleagues from the constituency. We ask that  the service that has been going on there, often unrecognised and  unacknowledged, is acknowledged by his Department through continued funding and  certitude about that funding in the longer term.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I will not delay the House any longer than is necessary. Much has been said; in  fact, it has all been said very precisely by my two Assembly colleagues, and I  support David McNarry and Simon Hamilton. I thank David for raising the plight  of Home-Start. As has already been said, Home-Start serves the Ards Peninsula,  Comber, Ballynahinch and further afield. I pay tribute to all the staff at  Home-Start for the excellent work that they have done. They have been in our  community for years, and all the local children and their parents and guardians  have benefited enormously from Home-Start.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is most unfortunate that there is real despondency among  the Home-Start workers at present. Indeed, there has been for quite a while.  They are working on a shoestring, and, because of the uncertainty about  funding, Home-Start, like all others, cannot plan for the future. That  unsatisfactory situation is compounded by the fact that there is no agreement  on the Budget at Executive level between the parties. Simon Hamilton mentioned  that. I appeal to those involved &mdash; particularly Sinn F&eacute;in, although none of its  Members is in the Chamber &mdash; to agree a Budget as soon as possible. Although no  Sinn F&eacute;in Members are in the Chamber, I hope that they hear my appeal and that  of others to get the Budget agreed as soon as possible for the benefit of all  voluntary agencies. Yesterday and today, we heard the Finance Minister respond  to questions about the plight of the voluntary agencies. Sammy Wilson was  willing to get the thing going, but he needed help from his Sinn F&eacute;in  colleagues &mdash; well, I presume it is his Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues. So, the  opportunity is there. Let the Assembly see what they are made of; let them come  forward with a Budget as soon as possible. Every Department needs to know what  its budget will be for the next number of years, and then everyone can continue  to provide a good, modern service to all who require it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank David McNarry for bringing this subject to the  Floor of the Assembly, and I will finish by saying that Home-Start has to be  supported and supported now. Closure for Home-Start is simply not an option. I  appeal to the Minister to listen to what his Assembly colleagues are telling  him today.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: I thank David  McNarry for creating the opportunity to have this debate and to take on board  the points that have been made.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In March 2001, the then Northern Ireland Executive created the  children&rsquo;s fund to provide direct support to children in need and young people  at risk, and they asked the Health Department to administer it on their behalf.  Voluntary and community groups working with children and young people were  invited to make applications for assistance in undertaking work that would  further the aims. In all, around 100 organisations were successful in their  applications. Those organisations engaged in a wide range of activities, such  as early years work, work with children and young people with disabilities,  family support programmes, juvenile justice projects and youth service-type  schemes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Of the successful applicants, four were local Home-Start  projects, one being Home-Start Ards, Comber and Peninsula Area. During that  period, it was provided with grant assistance in the region of &pound;196,000 from  the children&rsquo;s fund to support salary costs associated with its efforts. In  addition to funding from the children&rsquo;s fund, as part of the Health  Department&rsquo;s core grant funding arrangements, we provided and continued to  provide funding to Home-Start&rsquo;s regional office to assist with its central  running costs. Funding for all those projects continued until 2002, when the  centrally funded children&rsquo;s fund came to an end by order of the Executive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When the children&rsquo;s fund ended, it fell to individual  Departments to consider the future of the projects that fell within their  scope. For my part, I saw real value in the work being carried out by a range  of projects supported by the children&rsquo;s fund, and I felt that it would be a  shame to let them go. That is why I set aside resources from my own budget to  provide continuing support to over 40 former children&rsquo;s fund projects that were  pursuing activity that contributed to improving outcomes for children and their  families in line with the aims and objectives of my Department. Home-Start  Ards, Comber and Peninsula was one of those  projects that, since 2008, received a further &pound;89,000 in grant assistance from  my Department. I will make further funding of &pound;29,000 available to the project  between now and the end of the financial year. At this stage, unfortunately, I  am unable to guarantee any funding beyond that point, for reasons that Members  are well able to understand and appreciate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My Department wrote to the project in 2008 to let it know  that I had set aside money from my budget to continue to support its work, but  it was advised that we expected it to move, over the period of the funding  extension, to a position of self-sustainability. The project was treated no  differently to any of the other 40 projects that were funded in that way. The  Department is not the commissioner; that is a matter for the Health and Social  Care Board and the trust. I understand that Home-Start Ards, Comber and Peninsula has a contract with the South Eastern Health  and Social Care Trust to provide services to families in that area in line with  the policy commitment of my Department.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Evidence shows that appropriate prevention and early  intervention services for parents, particularly in the first three years of a  child&rsquo;s life, cannot be overestimated, so the provision fits the need and the  requirement of the Department. My Department has a particular focus on Families  Matter, the family and parenting strategy. Through that strategy, I invested  &pound;2&middot;5 million recurrently to support families through family support initiatives  such as parenting education, family mediation, child contact services and a  regional family support information system. Much of that is provided through  the voluntary and community sector. My officials are engaged with the Health  and Social Care Board to ensure that any unallocated funding out of the &pound;2&middot;5  million of Families Matter money is used to support early intervention services  for hard-to-reach families and provide not only practical assistance but help  in building their parenting, resilience and skill. Home-Start Ards, Comber and Peninsula is well positioned, as an existing service  provider, to enter into dialogue with the South Eastern Trust about how it can  further contribute to delivering that agenda.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many of the Members present spoke about the benefits and  values of the work of Home-Start, and I join Members in recognising the  achievement of all the Home-Start projects throughout Northern Ireland  and the dedication of its volunteers in making a difference to so many families  and children.</p>
