                the ‘Mid-Ulster Mail’, which was carried in that paper last
                Thursday. In the interview the Member alleged that shadowy
                figures linked to IRA/Sinn Féin were responsible for acts of
                violence against schoolchildren in Maghera. The next day a
                school in Greenlough was burnt in a Loyalist arson attack.</p>

                Durkan): </font></b><font SIZE="3">I wish to report to the
                Assembly on the meeting of the North/South Ministerial Council
                in the special European<b> </b>Union programmes sector, held in
                Omagh on Wednesday<b> 
                </b>
 15 November 2000. Mr Dermot Nesbitt and I
                attended the meeting. The Irish Government were represented by
                Mr Charlie McCreevy TD, Minister for Finance. My statement has
                been approved by Mr Nesbitt and is also made on his behalf.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council agreed that the various
                programmes in the remit of the Special European Union Programmes
                Body (SEUPB) had a major role to play in the development of
                peace and reconciliation and in economic and social progress on
                the island as a whole, particularly in the border areas. The
                Council looks forward to working closely with the SEUPB in
                implementing those important tasks.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council received a report on progress
                made towards recruiting a permanent chief executive. The post
                has been advertised and interviews are now being held. The
                Council noted the progress made and hoped that the permanent
                chief executive would be appointed as soon as possible to drive
                forward the important work of the body.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council received a report on actions
                taken to further the development of the SEUPB and was pleased to
                note that a second regional office of the body had opened
                temporary premises in Omagh and that permanent premises have
                been identified. The Omagh office will have lead responsibility
                for monitoring and promoting the implementation of the common
                chapter and particular responsibility for the cross-border
                priority of Peace II.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council highlighted the need for clarity
                on the roles and responsibilities of the body as it takes
                forward its developing work programme. The Council noted and
                endorsed the pace and nature of the developments of the SEUPB’s
                internal structures and mechanisms and its range of developing
                partnerships.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council noted that the negotiations on
                the Peace II operational programme were nearing conclusion and
                that the SEUPB had begun work on the programme complement. The
                Council attaches urgency to the completion of that work and
                hopes that negotiations with the European Commission on the
                operational programmes will be finalised as soon as possible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The membership of the Peace II monitoring
                committee was announced at the meeting. The committee will be
                established in shadow format, pending the formal adoption of the
                Peace II programme by the European Commission. The Council
                expressed a desire for an early meeting of the committee to
                enable it to have an input to the development of the Peace II
                programme complement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council approved the community initiative
                proposals for INTERREG III, Leader+ and EQUAL in Northern
                Ireland and Ireland, and the proposals for the URBAN II
                programme in Ireland for submission to the European Commission
                as a basis for negotiation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council recalled the important
                responsibilities of the SEUPB for grant making and other
                managerial functions in respect of the North/South elements of
                all the community initiatives in Northern Ireland and Ireland.
                It also recalled the ongoing role that the SEUPB will have in
                implementing and monitoring community initiatives throughout
                their lifetimes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council stressed the immediate need for
                the body to be directly involved in the forthcoming negotiations
                with the European Commission on the community initiative
                programme proposals provided for in the North/South Co-operation
                (Implementation Bodies) (Northern Ireland) Order 1999. The
                Council requested that it be kept informed of progress on those
                negotiations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council noted the progress made by the
                SEUPB in developing its responsibilities for monitoring and
                promoting implementation of the common chapter on cross- border
                co-operation contained in both Northern Ireland’s structural
                funds plan and Ireland’s national development plan. The
                Council agreed that delivery of the common chapter requires a
                consistent, coherent, co-ordinated approach to identification
                and implementation of cross- border co-operation on a
                North/South and east-west basis. The Council looks forward to a
                further progress report at the next sectoral meeting on EU
                programmes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council approved the SEUPB’s draft
                corporate plan for 2000-03 and the draft business plan for 2000.
                A new corporate plan will be presented to the council early in
                the new year. The Council approved and welcomed the code of
                conduct for the staff of the body and is confident that staff
                will apply all aspects of the code in discharging its duties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council considered a paper outlining the
                progress of spending on the Peace I programme and the INTERREG
                II programme. The Council noted the position on commitments of
                funds under both programmes and that overall expenditure at
                30&nbsp;June&nbsp;2000 stood at 66% of the Peace&nbsp;I
                allocation and 79% of the INTERREG&nbsp;II allocation. The
                Council agreed that this was an important area of work and that
                further sustained effort will be required to ensure that full
                expenditure is achieved by 31&nbsp;December&nbsp;2001. The
                Council also noted that the body will provide a further progress
                report on the implementation of both programmes at the next
                sectoral meeting on the special EU&nbsp;programmes. The Council
                agreed the text of a joint communiqué, which was issued
                following the meeting. A copy of the communiqué has been placed
                in the Assembly Library.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would also like to cover two items that
                fall within my responsibilities and which were dealt with at the
                North/South Ministerial Council sectoral meeting on
                17&nbsp;November. Ms&nbsp;Rodgers will be making a full
                statement on that meeting in due course. Following approval by
                the Executive Committee, the Council agreed final
                recommendations on the budgets for the six North/South
                implementation bodies. Details are set out in the table attached
                to my statement. The contributions from the North and South will
                go forward for approval by the Assembly and the Dáil
                respectively, as part of the Budgets and Estimates, North and
                South. Thus, the Executive have agreed the Northern
                contributions that will be recommended to the Assembly as part
                of the revised Budget that I will introduce next month.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second item is the URBAN&nbsp;II
                community initiative. The Executive Committee agreed on
                16&nbsp;November that the URBAN&nbsp;II programme proposals for
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland be submitted to the North/South
                Ministerial Council. This happened at the sectoral meeting on
                17&nbsp;November, and the Council agreed to those proposals
                being submitted to the European Commission as a basis for
                negotiation over the next five months.</p>

                I welcome the Minister’s statement on European funding. It is
                an important stepping stone, and we hope to make continued
                progress on it. Can the Minister tell us when Peace&nbsp;II
                money will be available, so that groups with a gap in funding
                will be able to ensure the continuity of their projects? What
                problems are being encountered? Do they relate to match funding
                from other Departments and organisations to allow some of these
                groups to draw down the extra money for the completion of
                payments in those schemes?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Chairperson of the Finance and
                Personnel Committee for his Committee’s interest in these
                areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, we had hoped to be further forward
                with the proposals for the Peace II programme. There has been
                some delay in finalising the community support framework.
                Although it is the Commission’s document, the Administration
                has been working with the Commission on the operational
                programmes. That is the next stage. When operational programmes
                for Peace&nbsp;II and transitional Objective&nbsp;1 are agreed,
                we will bring forward the more detailed proposals, within a few
                months, at the programme complement stage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are working on the operational programmes
                and the programme complements, but under EU&nbsp;regulations the
                monitoring committees have to be able to make an input to those.
                Our work would be assisted if we had everything we needed from
                all the Northern&nbsp;Ireland Government Departments. We are
                still awaiting some contributions on the operational programme.
                We are determined to try to proceed as quickly as possible
                because we recognise the expectations, the needs and the gaps.
                However, in all likelihood we will not be in a position to call
                for applications for Peace&nbsp;II until the new year.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to Peace I, the most up to date
                figure that I have is for the end of September. It shows that
                70% of Peace I funds have now been drawn down. We have only
                until 31 December 2001 to complete that work. There are a range
                of issues and problems involved, and we are trying to identify
                the problems of particular sectors and groups to see whether we
                can come up with specific solutions.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s statement, which
                shows that considerable advance in this area has been made. Can
                he tell us about the role of local government in the
                administration of INTERREG III funding? It has been envisaged
                for some time that it would be done through the three
                cross-border committees that exist in Northern Ireland?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In reply to an earlier question of mine, the
                Minister indicated some favour towards the idea of an Assembly
                oversight committee for the administration of the EU programmes.
                Does he still see merit in such a suggestion and, if so, how
                could it be done?</p>

                Ministerial Council, have been submitted. We will give further
                consideration to precisely how local delivery, and area-based,
                mechanisms can facilitate that programme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill mentioned cross-border networks. I
                have previously recognised how they have contributed to our
                understanding in this area. It would be wrong for me to say that
                those groups will be directly engaged as delivery mechanisms for
                INTERREG III. It would simply be inappropriate to make any
                promise at this stage, but clearly the cross-border network
                groups are particularly well placed to make proposals regarding
                INTERREG III. Obviously, they have submitted some critical
                comments about the present proposals, and they are well placed
                to make a further contribution to our thinking and to the life
                of the programme itself.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am open to dealing with any Committee of
                the Assembly. I seem to be picking up Assembly Committees to
                work with; it is certainly a growth sector in my area of
                activity, and we can take another one if that is needed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue is whether the Finance and
                Personnel Committee believes that there is a further, distinct
                role to be discharged regarding the Assembly’s interest in the
                community support framework and the various EU programmes, and
                whether it believes that anything distinctive could be done by
                another Committee. I recognise that other Members also have an
                interest in the question.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister acknowledge that the £1·2
                million being allocated from the Executive’s Budget would be
                better spent in actual programmes within Northern Ireland? Does
                he recognise that the cross-border element reduces the ability
                of areas not along the border to tap into that money? Is there
                not, therefore, an element of discrimination against areas such
                as Lagan Valley?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I repeat the point that the allocations being
                made to the six implementation bodies are not huge allocations
                when taken against the budget as a whole.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They are significant, but they go towards
                supporting some significant services and work by the bodies.
                Some of the work was already being undertaken in other forms
                and, as it has to continue, we feel that it will be performed
                and discharged better in the particular context of the
                North/South implementation bodies. There can be economies of
                scale and performance efficiencies through co-operating in that
                regard.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I refute any suggestion of discrimination
                against any part of Northern Ireland regarding EU programmes.
                Obviously, some EU programmes apply to specific areas, rather
                than to Northern Ireland as a whole. For example, URBAN II
                proposals apply particularly to north Belfast, but that does not
                mean that the rest of Northern Ireland is discriminated against
                because it is not benefiting directly from URBAN II. Mr Poots
                may not have noticed that the whole of Northern Ireland will be
                eligible under INTERREG III as opposed to previous INTERREG
                programmes. I am at a loss to understand why there should be any
                suggestion of discrimination against any part of Northern
                Ireland.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
                I welcome the Minister’s statement. However, I have a specific
                concern about the presence of Mr Dermot Nesbitt, given his
                recent comments in the press, where he claimed to be quoting
                from the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA)
                report. Subsequently we were told that it is not a report but
                simply a briefing for the various Ministers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given that Mr Nesbitt has responsibility, in
                the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister,
                for matters including equality, his remarks, which were quoted
                in the local press, are of great concern to all of us. He
                suggested that NISRA said — I do not know whether they are
                saying it, because I have not seen the briefing — that there
                was no discrimination between the communities. What input did Mr
                Nesbitt have at the sectoral meeting, given the major role that
                EU programmes have in ending discrimination and given that Mr
                Nesbitt is on public record as saying that it did not exist?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Nesbitt was one of two Ministers from the
                Northern side who were present at the meeting. I was the other
                Minister. I am making the report because these matters are
                within the responsibility of my Department. We participated in
                the meeting on the basis of the papers and positions approved by
                the Executive Committee, which is the proper way to do business
                at the North/South Ministerial Council (NSMC).</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note Mr Maskey’s concerns about the
                comments made by Mr Nesbitt on a previous occasion about another
                issue, but I hope that Mr Maskey is not suggesting that more
                parties should engage in vetting tactics as far as other
                Ministers’ participation in the NSMC is concerned. I am happy
                to participate with any Minster from any other party in NSMC
                business on behalf of the Executive on proper, approved and
                agreed terms. I hope that everybody else would do the same. I do
                not think that anything would be gained by saying that we will
                not go to certain meetings with certain Ministers because of
                other issues that may arise.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the details of what is happening in
                the European structural fund programmes. However, I would be
                grateful for further clarification on a number of points. I
                would like to focus on the funding mechanisms under Peace I and
                Peace II. First, is it the definition of funding bodies that is
                holding up the negotiations on Peace II? Secondly, will the
                Minister make it clear that the intermediary funding bodies that
                existed under Peace I and the district councils will have a role
                to play under Peace II. What role will that be?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, will the six North/South
                implementation bodies carry out a funding function similar to
                that of the intermediary funding bodies, and will their funding
                come from European programmes, particularly Peace?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, the negotiations on Peace II are
                ongoing. As I said, the community support framework — the
                Commission’s paper, which we had expected would be formalised
                in the summer — has taken longer than expected. Nevertheless,
                negotiations are proceeding in respect of the operational
                programme and the programme complements. There are a number of
                issues that need to be explored by ourselves and the European
                Commission. It would help our officials if we had the necessary
                material from all the Northern Ireland Government Departments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The intermediary funding bodies have made a
                useful, distinctive and helpful contribution to Peace I. We see
                the importance of such a role continuing with Peace II, but we
                must put that work out to tender. That would be consistent with
                the European Commission’s own requirements. The European Court
                of Auditors’ report was somewhat critical of the fact that it
                had not happened in Peace I. It would also be appropriate with
                regard to public procurement policy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are continuing to engage with a range of
                interests — local partnerships and local government, as well
                as staying in touch with others such as the intermediary funding
                bodies on how best to develop local delivery mechanisms and
                local funding arrangements during the Peace II programme. A
                working group involving representatives from district
                partnerships, local government and intermediary funding bodies
                will shortly be making proposals to me in that regard.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Byrne:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s progress report on
                the workings of the special EU programmes body. I am delighted
                that the Omagh office is now open and that it will monitor and
                promote the implementation of the common chapter and have
                responsibility for the cross- border priority of Peace II.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How will the North/South Ministerial Council
                endeavour to make the common chapter a more meaningful,
                practical and relevant exercise in the next round of structural
                funds? Unfortunately, in the 1994-99 round, the common chapter
                became an illusion rather than a meaningful exercise. That was
                particularly disappointing for those of us who live in the
                border zone. There is a need for real North/South co-operation
                on transport infrastructure.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Charlie McCreevy, Mr Dermot Nesbitt and I
                were glad to have the meeting — the first Northern meeting in
                sectoral format — in Omagh, not least to mark the fact that
                there will be an office of the special EU programmes body in the
                town. As Mr Byrne said, that office will have a particular focus
                on the cross- border activities of Peace I and on the
                implementation of the common chapter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He is also right in pointing out that it is
                not the first time that there has been a common chapter. I have
                said elsewhere that the previous common chapter was a great book
                but the movie never got made. This time we at least have a
                production system for the special EU programmes body and a
                North/South Ministerial Council with a dedicated sectoral format
                that can consider those issues. I welcome particularly the
                commitment of Mr McCreevy and his colleagues in the Irish
                Government to pursue the common chapter actively and
                effectively. We need to make sure that we are not just making
                commitments that are notionally on a cross-border basis but that
                do not mesh on a North/South basis. It is not just the quantity
                of cross-border activity that counts, it is the quality, and the
                body and the North/South Ministerial Council both wish to see it
                developed effectively.</p>

                budget provisions for 2002 would increase by 9·6%, compared to
                this year’s figure, and for 2003 by 16·13%, compared to this
                year’s figure? Can the Minister explain in detail how he
                arrived at those figures?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The figures for 2001 and 2002 in the draft
                Northern Ireland Budget were based on financial years. Those
                figures do not, therefore, correspond precisely with the budgets
                for the bodies, which are expressed on the basis of calendar
                years. This is not the first time that I have made that point.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any further revisions are subject to
                confirmation by the relevant sector of the North/South
                Ministerial Council. Some adjustments will be made in respect of
                the trade body. There will probably be a reduction of £200,000
                in the amount proposed in the draft Budget. That will ensure
                consistency with the decisions taken at NSMC level. Similarly,
                there will be an increase of probably £400,000 in the
                allocation to the languages body to reflect that body’s
                activities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The future projections are based on the plans
                brought forward by the bodies and approved by the North/South
                Ministerial Council, both in its relevant sectoral format and in
                plenary session. The plans were discussed in plenary forum at
                Dublin Castle in September and again in the various sectoral
                formats, and have been approved by the Northern Ireland
                Executive on that basis.</p>

                Following nomination by the First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister, Mr Dermot Nesbitt and I represented Northern Ireland.
                Mr Frank Fahey TD, Minister for the Marine and Natural
                Resources, represented the Irish Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive Committee noted the papers for
                the NSMC on 9 November 2000. The meeting opened with useful
                updates from the chairman of the board of the Foyle, Carlingford
                and Irish Lights Commission, Mr Peter Savage, and the chief
                executive, Mr Derick Anderson. The chairman outlined the Loughs
                Agency’s progress in establishing subcommittees on shell
                fisheries, marine tourism and finance and audit.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The shell fisheries subcommittee proposes to
                undertake a programme of visits to other shell fisheries on the
                island of Ireland to see the co-ordinated local agricultural
                management systems in operation. It is hoped that the system
                will provide a model on which to base shell fisheries management
                in Lough Foyle and Carlingford Lough. The marine tourism
                subcommittee attended a seminar organised by the Marine
                Institute and the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources
                on grant-aid proposals. The finance and audit subcommittee
                approved the re-prioritisation of in-year expenditure and
                considered the estimated needs for 2001.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Board members have also undertaken
                familiarisation visits to see drift and draft netting, fish
                population counting and fish counters, electro-fishing and
                oyster farming. The chief executive updated the meeting on
                staffing matters in both areas, particularly on progress on
                recruitment in the Carlingford area. He also advised that the
                agency had secured accommodation in Carlingford, which it hopes
                to occupy from 1 December. The chief executive also updated the
                meeting on population, catch and production data for salmon and
                shellfish in both areas, on the extent of seizures of illegal
                nets and, most worryingly, on the level of aggression with which
                river watchers have to contend in carrying out their duties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council then considered and approved a
                number of papers. These were: proposals on consultation with
                fisheries interests in the Carlingford Lough and Foyle areas;
                preparation by the agency of four sets of Regulations on salmon
                carcass tagging to extend protection to migratory salmonids on a
                stretch of the River Mourne, to lift a ban on angling on a
                stretch of the River Foyle, to extend close seasons in both the
                Carlingford and Foyle areas, and to provide for a coarse angling
                licence in the Carlingford area; and a paper bringing forward
                costed proposals regarding grant-aid in the year 2001 for
                aquaculture, fisheries development, marine tourism, marketing,
                training and education, and the use of consultancies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, the Council was updated on the

                that board members have undertaken familiarisation visits to see
                drift and draft netting, fish population counting with fish
                counters, and electro-fishing. When will the Minister, through
                the Council, begin to pursue a policy of banning all forms of
                netting? Is she considering the allocation of funds to begin the
                process of buying out netting enterprises?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister further confirm whether the
                aggression experienced by the river watchers in the execution of
                their duties occurred on the northern or southern shore of the
                lough?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, will the Minister also give details
                of the extent of the problem posed by illegal nets? Can the
                problem be quantified in terms of salmon lost and income lost?</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not sure that the first part of the
                question relates to my report. The aggression experienced by the
                river watchers was in the Foyle area. Two of the agency’s
                river watchers were attacked by a group of men while carrying
                out their duties in the Sion Mills area. The Loughs Agency fully
                supported the officers and asked the police to investigate. I
                know that a private river watcher suffered intimidation in the
                Omagh area and, despite this, subsequently gave evidence at a
                court case in which a prosecution was obtained. I commend those
                people; they do a difficult job, and it was very courageous of
                that river watcher to go ahead with the prosecution despite the
                fact that he had been threatened.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not aware of any plans to ban netting at
                this stage. In answer to the last part of the question, I repeat
                that the aggression occurred on the northern side.</p>

                to provide services and consultation, particularly in the
                Carlingford Lough area? The Minister may be aware that the
                Carlingford Lough Owners Association was promised consultation
                with respect to new developments and matters affecting it. Is
                she aware that a planning application is being made for yet
                another shellfish processing plant, that the association was not
                consulted and only read about it in the newspapers? Will the
                Minister undertake to investigate the matter and see that the
                proper and appropriate consultation will be carried out, even if

                Does the Minister believe that the four sets of proposals for

                to protect future tourism and the other gains that that would

                measures being taken for the protection of salmon in the area.
                The answer is yes. We are preparing legislation on salmon
                tagging, and I am satisfied that those measures will be
                successful and that preservation of stocks, which is of key

                on an all-island basis. For example, we will have the same

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the second part of his
                question, I can tell him that the agency is aware of the need
                for consultation. There are many interests to be taken into
                consideration. Many people want to be consulted and to have
                input into the making of the legislation. The Loughs Agency is
                developing a formal procedure for consulting its customers and
                other parties in the Foyle and Carlingford areas who have an
                interest in its work. As part of the process, the agency
                recently invited interested parties to make suggestions on how
                the agency should establish consultation arrangements in order
                to ensure that interested parties are given the opportunity to
                have an input into the agency’s decision-making process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The outcome of the exercise is that the
                agency plans to establish an advisory forum and focus groups on
                which local fishing interests will be represented. The Member
                will be interested to learn that a consultant has been retained
                by the agency to recruit members independently to the forum and
                the focus groups to ensure that all interests are represented
                and that the representatives are truly independent.</p>

                sure that everything goes well. Can the Minister tell us what
                the Loughs Agency’s proposals are? What promotion will be
                necessary for the development of coarse angling in the

                Council meeting in Brussels, I had discussions with British
                Agriculture Minister, Nick Brown, the other UK Agriculture
                Ministers and the Republic’s Agriculture Minister, Joe Walsh.
                I also had a meeting with the Health Commissioner, David Byrne.
                Members will be aware of the increased level of awareness of BSE
                and heightened public concerns arising from recent development
                in France and other member states.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the light of those discussions and, in
                particular, of the increase in the incidence of BSE in Northern
                Ireland this year, as well as the current climate with regard to
                BSE in other member states, I have reviewed my position on a
                formal submission to the Commission to call for a relaxation of
                the export ban. I have also taken into account concerns
                expressed by other member states about a call from Northern
                Ireland for a relaxation of the ban at this time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have decided, therefore, that it would be
                inappropriate and possibly counterproductive for me to proceed
                with the case at the moment. I am still fully committed to
                obtaining a relaxation of the export ban for Northern Ireland.
                In the meantime, my Department will finalise its proposals in
                light of the consultation exercise and the findings of the
                recent inspection carried out in Northern Ireland by the EU Food
                and Veterinary Office. It will also continue to hold informal
                discussions with the Commission at official level. I will
                consider the action that should be taken in Northern Ireland to
                ensure that we comply with the European Agriculture Council’s
                conclusions and the resultant decision of the Standing

                by highlighting the benefits of traceability, rather than
                doing nothing, as she, in effect, proposes. Now is the time to
                put traceability to the test. In the wake of the earlier BSE crisis,
                Northern Ireland put in place the most sophisticated and
                rigorous tracing system for beef cattle in Europe. As a
                result, Northern Ireland and British beef is now the safest in
                Europe.</p>

                from all quarters, and which I feel instinctively is the right
                advice, was that this is not a good time or a good context
                within which to try to convince the other member states that we
                should have a relaxation of the ban. I agree with the Member
                that we have an excellent traceability system. All those issues
                will come into play when the time is right, but we must remember
                that we will get one shot at this and that we must take that
                shot only when the time is right and when we are going to get
                what we want.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister referred to the increase in BSE
                in France and Germany and also Northern Ireland. What is the
                increase in BSE incidence in Northern Ireland? What is
                responsible for it, and what action is she taking to deal with

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall put the cases of BSE in perspective.
                In 1992, we had almost 500 cases here. That gradually decreased
                until 1998, when we had 18 cases. Last year, we had only six
                cases, but, unfortunately, this year we have had 20. That is not
                a cause for concern, but, at present, people in Europe are
                unable to look at it logically. The epidemiology suggests that
                when it falls to the low numbers, there will no longer be a
                regular downward decline; there will be a bump — an
                irregularity — at the bottom. One will have good years, when
                the numbers are low, and bad years. That is the position.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will continue with the strict controls
                that are already in place. We have the strictest and toughest
                controls in Europe, and I do not intend to have any further
                controls, as they are not necessary. As Mr Savage said, we have
                an excellent traceability system.</p>

                for a relaxation of the ban. The Member, who is on the Food

                want to assure the Member that I have taken every opportunity to
                engage in discussions with the other member states, and in
                particular with France. I have had meetings with French
                officials twice in the past number of months to ensure that when
                we come to put our case we will get their full support, which

                for some time. Does the Minister see that as a danger? If our
                case was right the week before this happened in Europe, it must
                still be right. Will the Government consider doing something for
                local farmers, who now face a serious drop in prices because of

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will not give out the wrong message. As I
                have explained, the decision that I have taken is the correct
                decision. The current situation in Europe is that member states
                are not prepared to listen to rational argument and to our
                strong case. Therefore, it would be foolish in the extreme for
                me to fire ahead on the basis that we can put a good case and
                say, &quot;To hell with the circumstances.&quot; I agree with
                the Member that we have a good case on the basis of our numbers
                and our extremely strict controls. However, I will not put a
                good case at a bad time. Our message is strong, and people will
                hear it when they are in a position to listen.</p>

                deferred only because of the current climate. I still intend to
                submit the proposal to the Commission when the time is right.
                Producers can feel heartened that the proposal will go to the
                Commission, but in the meantime the status quo will be
                maintained. I received £2 million in the Budget for the beef
                quality initiative. I was also allocated £300,000 in the
                monitoring round to kick-start the beef quality initiative,

                decision to apply for special status when she sees the time as

                states to look for support for my proposals. I am waiting until
                we are ready to put the proposal formally — that is the best

                right and we are beginning to move towards the formal proposals,
                I intend to go to the various European countries to speak to
                them. Indeed, the agriculture attachés from the different
                embassies in London are coming to Northern Ireland soon. In
                preparation for putting the case, I am also going over to inform
                them of exactly how good our controls are and how low the

                assure us that the controls imposed on farmers by the Department
                will strengthen our case when it is presented? Secondly —
                perhaps this sounds repetitive — does the Minister think that
                there will ever be a right time to proceed, given the work that
                she has already carried out in this field?</p>

                question. I had hoped that the time was right six months ago.
                The fact that circumstances are not right at the moment is
                beyond my control. However, I am sure that the right time will
                come. The time will come when the panic is over, when our case
                will be even stronger. As people look around Europe and see our
                level of incidence and our controls, compared with those of
                other countries, they will be easier to convince and, in a
                calmer situation, the strength of our case will be noted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am under no illusion that we can get away
                with poor record keeping. If we are to get out of this mess and
                get the ban lifted, we must be sure that we can compete with the
                best, and maintaining proper herd records is essential for that
                reason. Traceability, both pre- and post-slaughter, will become
                even more essential as a result of the latest BSE developments
                in Europe. We are well placed, and that can be seen when
                compared with the records of our rivals. We also have a serious
                problem with bovine TB and brucellosis. Therefore it is
                important for us to keep accurate accounts. Nonetheless, I am

                International des Epizooties (OIE) low incidence terms, that is
                equivalent to 25 per million. Incidence in the Republic is 101
                this year, which is equivalent to 27 per million under the OIE
                criteria. In France, the incidence in the nine years prior to
                2000 was 80. This year alone it is 86, which is a huge increase,
                but still only equivalent to six per million. Our incidence this
                year is three times that of France. Of course, we had an
                incidence of almost 500 in 1992, whereas we now have 20, so we

                under 30 months are allowed into the food chain in Northern
                Ireland. Even those animals have all specified risk material
                removed before they go into the food chain. Therefore all our
                precautions and controls are extremely tough and strict, and

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The European Union has insisted that 2,500
                cattle be tested over the next year, beginning on 1 January
                2001. The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development has
                begun that task ahead of schedule — we are ahead of the game.
                All cattle of over 30 months going into the food chain may have
                to be tested, but as none over 30 months goes into the food
                chain in Northern Ireland, it may not be necessary to test them
                all. Mr Poots may, of course, have some source of inspiration or

                cases have been reported. However, there are 101 cases in the
                Irish Republic, but there is no stir or sense of urgency about
                them. Are people in Northern Ireland and Great Britain protected
                against potentially infected meat from BSE animals from the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The incidence of BSE in Northern Ireland is
                currently 25 per million, while in the Irish Republic it is 27
                per million. Clearly the rate in Northern Ireland is lower. It
                is illegal for any country to sell cattle of over 30 months of
                age to Northern Ireland and introduce them into the food chain
                here. The problem exists across the United Kingdom, and we are
                examining how it might be resolved. The Food Safety Agency is
                immediately undertaking a risk assessment of French beef. The
                over-30-month regulations are being rigorously enforced at meat
                processing plants and by retailers, and all beef for the
                domestic market has to be certified as coming from animals of
                under 30 months. The Commission is being pressed to ensure that
                the compulsory labelling of meat and processed products clearly
                states the country of origin.</p>

                should strike a medallion to be awarded to firefighters and
                support personnel in recognition of the outstanding service that
                they have provided over the past 30 years, deciding instead that
                a corporate award by the Assembly would be more appropriate. The
                Executive also agreed that the Office of the First Minister and
                the Deputy First Minister should investigate whether a state
                award would also be achievable or appropriate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will be aware that, while the
                Executive’s June decision regarding the awarding of medallions
                by the Fire Authority was initially welcomed, firefighters’
                representatives subsequently expressed growing concern that such
                an award was not appropriate. With the agreement of the
                Executive, I discussed those concerns with representatives of
                the Fire Brigades Union, who suggested a number of options. I
                informed the Executive of those views at our last meeting, and
                we decided to adopt the revised proposals that I have just
                announced.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I said to the Assembly in June, many
                people owe their lives to the courage and skill of our
                firefighters and the important contribution of brigade support
                staff. My Executive colleagues and I wish to recognise that
                outstanding service in an appropriate and acceptable way.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Health, Social
                Services and Public Safety Committee (Dr Hendron): </b>I welcome
                the Minister’s statement. Members will be in total agreement
                that the outstanding service of those in the Fire Brigade who
                have so gallantly provided a service to the entire community
                over the past 30 years should be recognised in an appropriate
                and acceptable way. We should also take into account the views
                of the families of those firefighters who gave their lives
                — something I myself have seen in West Belfast. I note that
                the Executive, in reaching their decision on the type of
                award, have taken on board the views of representatives of the
                Fire Brigades Union.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A corporate award from the Assembly is, of
                course, appropriate. However, does the Minister agree that other
                organisations and individuals, with the possible inclusion of
                the Secretary of State himself, may wish to honour the Fire
                Service? It is, of course, a matter for those people.</p>

                the work of the Fire Service over the period in question. It is
                important that we pay tribute to it, and that is why the
                Executive Committee took the decision to ensure that the most
                appropriate award be made. There will be further discussion of
                the issue in this afternoon’s debate. There may well be others
                who wish to honour the Fire Service, but we must consider what
                the Executive feel. The Assembly will also wish to take this
                forward in accordance with its own wishes.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is the Minister of Health, Social Services
                and Public Safety once again being political, brushing such a
                serious decision off onto the First Minister and the Deputy
                First Minister? I remind the Minister that her remit covers the
                Fire Service. The Department should recommend that a state medal
                be awarded to the Fire Service, whose members have served this
                community with great distinction.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What the Member is suggesting is not
                necessarily in order. It is not for a Department or the
                Executive to confer a state award. That is entirely a matter for
                the sovereign, who is the fount of all such awards. Of course,
                it is possible for anyone, including any individual, the
                Department, or the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy
                First Minister, to make a recommendation. I simply want to make
                it clear that the decision would be one well beyond the
                responsibilities of the Assembly. However, I give the Minister
                the opportunity to respond, if she so chooses.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive decided that we needed to
                consider the form that a state award might take and whether it
                is achievable and fully acceptable to the firefighters. The
                Executive will consider the matter again when the work has been
                completed.</p>

                Agreement calls for sensitivity on flags and emblems, may I ask
                whether the Minister is satisfied that a corporate award is the
                best way to ensure that every member of the Fire Service would
                be happy to accept it?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member will be aware of my position,
                which is that any award, at any stage, should be such that all
                who are to receive the award would be happy to accept it. It is
                not for me to say this morning what kind of corporate award
                should be made. I merely point out that the Executive have
                decided that a corporate award by the Assembly would be more
                appropriate.</p>

                on the bravery and commitment of the Fire Service over the
                years. I withdrew my motion on the Fire Service some weeks ago,
                as I had been advised that the Executive would take a decision
                on the matter. I am sorry that the DUP, unlike ourselves, did
                not wait for that Executive decision but relaunched its motion
                for reasons that seem to have nothing to do with the wishes of
                most firefighters. Can the Minister assure the Assembly that the
                matter will be dealt with as a priority?</p>

                speed. I repeat that, although the Executive have decided that a
                corporate award by the Assembly would be more appropriate, it is
                not for the Executive to dictate to the Assembly how that is
                done or the timescale.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Minister has repeatedly said, although
                the Executive may decide that an award would be appropriate, the
                award will not be from the Executive or the Department but from
                the Assembly. The decision is one for the Assembly. If the
                Assembly were to decide — and it might decide such a thing
                today —it would probably be for the Commission to take forward
                the practicalities.</p>

                decided that the Fire Service of Northern Ireland, after working
                through 30 years of terrorism, needs a proper award. A civic
                award would be an insult, and that idea has already been
                rejected by both the Fire Brigades Union and the Fire Authority
                itself. A state award, granted by Her Majesty the Queen, to
                recognise professionalism, bravery and commitment, would be most
                appropriate. Will the Minister, with all diligence, petition Her

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Regulations were laid before the Assembly
                on 22 June 2000. This is the first time that I have sought the
                approval of the Assembly for Regulations relating to social
                security, pensions and child support. It may be helpful if I
                begin with an explanation of why the confirmatory procedure —
                the strongest form of Assembly control over Regulations — is
                being used.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Parity between Great Britain and Northern
                Ireland means not only parity of content but parity of timing.
                The Great Britain Regulations to which the Northern Ireland
                Regulations correspond will have been approved by Parliament
                shortly before they were made, so it is not possible for the
                Assembly to approve the Northern Ireland Regulations and match
                the operative date. The use of the confirmatory procedure, under
                which the Regulations are made and come into operation but must
                be approved by the Assembly within six months of the operative
                date, enables us to do this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not propose to speak on every amendment
                made by the Social Security and Child Support (Miscellaneous
                Amendments) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2000, but I shall, of
                course, be happy to respond to Members’ questions. The
                Regulations correspond to Regulations for Great Britain made by
                the Secretary of State for Social Security following their
                approval by the House of Commons on 8 June and the House of
                Lords on 14 June. Therefore, they are a parity measure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Principally, these Regulations amend the
                Social Security and Child Support (Decisions and Appeals)
                Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1999, which I shall refer to as
                the decisions and appeals Regulations. They also amend
                Regulations on claims and payments, child support and industrial
                injuries. The decisions and appeals Regulations were made under
                powers in the Social Security (Northern Ireland) Order 1998.
                That Order set up a new decision making and appeals system in
                social security and child support. The decisions and appeals
                Regulations provided the detailed framework for an improved
                decision-making and dispute-resolution system, a simplified
                appeals system and the introduction of a modern, accountable
                appeals service. The new system was implemented in relation to
                child support in June 1999, and over the period from July 1999
                to November 1999 with regard to social security benefits.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amendments to the decisions and appeals
                Regulations are purely technical and are intended to improve the
                service to claimants. They are based on the experience of the
                live running of the decision-making and appeals system and are
                all beneficial.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Regulations can be broken down into three
                parts. The first tier deals with decision making, appeals and
                other matters. The changes being made to the first tier aim to
                secure more effective and efficient management of the new
                process. There are three key changes. First, there is a clearer
                definition of official error. The original definition caused
                confusion, and, more significantly, there was the possibility
                that claimants would be penalised where no penalty was intended.
                Secondly, changes are to be made to bridge payment gaps when the
                Department supersedes a decision on its own initiative. Thirdly,
                there is to be clarification of the effective date of a decision
                which replaces an earlier one made by a tribunal or a
                commissioner on disability and incapacity benefits.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amendments relating to appeals, which
                affect the composition of tribunals, striking-out, decision
                notices and time limits are all aimed at approving the service
                for appellants by streamlining the administration of appeals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The other amendments deal with the tidying-up
                of the decision-making process for industrial injury scheme
                benefits. They are designed to ensure that the decision- making
                and appeals principles are adhered to and to improve the
                administration of claims where the entitlement is dependent on
                the award of another benefit. The existing provisions can lead
                to delays in people getting their full entitlement. In future,
                provided people act within a defined time, payment will be made
                more promptly and automatically.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The new decision-making and appeals
                arrangements have already had a positive impact on the way in
                which the agencies and the appeals service handle disputes and
                appeals. However, there is always room for improvement. I am
                confident that the Regulations will help to bring about that
                improvement.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Social Development Committee considered
                this Statutory Rule along with the report from the Examiner of
                Statutory Rules at a meeting on 14 September. The Examiner drew
                the Committee’s attention to his concern about the Rule under
                Standing Order 41(4)(g). The Standing Order requires the

                policy behind it.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Statutory Rule contains some provisions
                that are subject to negative resolution and some that shall
                cease to have effect unless approved by resolution of the
                Assembly — that is, by confirmatory procedure. The Examiner
                thought that that could lead to procedural difficulties and that
                it should be avoided unless clearly contemplated by the enabling
                legislation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1950, the Speaker of the House of Commons
                ruled that it was not appropriate to have both procedures in the
                same instrument. The Examiner recognised that, in the context,
                the enabling legislation in this case intended that these
                Regulations should be subject to the confirmatory procedure, but
                exposed some doubts about its clarity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Social Development Committee has no
                objections to the content of this rule and does not wish to
                delay it. Therefore, it recommends that the Assembly approve it.
                It asks, however, Mr&nbsp;Speaker, that you consider the general
                point raised by the Examiner and make a ruling. I have forwarded
                a copy of the Examiner’s full report to your Office, and I

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In response to the point made by the Chairman
                of the Social Development Committee, I want to say that I am
                aware of the report of the Examiner of Statutory Rules. I have
                considered his views on the inclusion in the same instrument of
                provisions subject to the confirmatory procedure and those
                subject to negative resolution. It is not clear from the
                reference in the report to the 1950 ruling by the Speaker of the
                House of Commons whether that was the House of Commons at
                Stormont or at Westminster. In any event, that was 1950 — we
                have moved on since then.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Prior to 1990, it was the practice to include
                Regulations subject to the confirmatory procedure in a separate
                instrument from those subject to negative resolution. That was
                consistent with the practice in Great Britain. However, the
                Social Security Act 1990 amended the legislation relating to
                parliamentary control of subordinate legislation to allow
                provisions subject to affirmative and negative resolution to be
                included in a single instrument, subject to affirmative
                resolution. That was during direct rule, and the Social Security
                (Northern Ireland) Order 1990 allowed for Northern Ireland to
                make provisions subject to negative resolution that could be
                combined with provisions subject to affirmative resolution and
                for those Regulations to be subject to the confirmatory
                procedure. Since 1990, all primary legislation concerning social
                security, pensions and child support has continued that
                practice.</p>

                the confirmatory procedure and those subject to negative
                resolution. Such an instrument is subject to the confirmatory
                procedure. That means that the reader can find the relevant
                provision in a single set of Regulations instead of two, and
                there is a financial saving. The cost of a single set of

                Regulations is not diminished; it is strengthened. That is a
                proper and effective way to process Regulations, and I recommend

                Secretary of State for Social Security for Great Britain,
                following approval by the House of Commons on 12&nbsp;July and
                the House of Lords on 19&nbsp;July. This is a parity measure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Regulations amend existing housing
                benefit, income support and jobseeker’s allowance legislation
                in three ways. First, they introduce new provisions for students
                who have recovered from illness or are former carers. In some
                cases, students who are ready to resume their studies may not be
                allowed to do so immediately by their educational establishment.
                Often, they have to wait until the start of the next academic
                year. In such circumstances those students who have recovered
                from an illness or who are former carers do not receive
                educational support and are not eligible for jobseeker’s
                allowance or housing benefit because they have not finished
                their full-time courses.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Regulations provide that, subject to the
                normal rules, such students will be eligible to claim jobseeker’s
                allowance and, where appropriate, housing benefit. The period
                during which they will be able to claim benefit is from the date
                of recovery from illness, or the end of their caring duties,
                until the date when they are able to join their courses or the
                start of the next academic year, whichever is sooner. That
                positive support will help those individuals to help themselves.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, the Regulations tighten up the
                definition of full-time student for the purpose of housing
                benefit, income support and jobseeker’s allowance — the
                income-related benefits. It re-emphasises the existing policy
                that those benefits are not normally payable to students until
                they finally complete, abandon or are dismissed from their
                course.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, they make technical amendments to
                provide a better alignment of definitions across all the income-
                related benefits. They make positive progress in maintaining the
                interface between social security and education maintenance.
                They will enable the &quot;recovered ill&quot; and &quot;former
                carers&quot; to claim jobseeker’s allowance and housing
                benefit until they are able to resume their studies.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat. I have some concerns
                about the regulations. I welcome the move to assess modular
                students at the time of their claim, as opposed to the first day
                of their course, but I believe that the restrictions on claiming
                income support or jobseeker’s allowance while registered on a
                part-time basis are too prohibitive. Students are not entitled
                to support from their education and library board as they are
                registered as part-time, yet they are not entitled to jobseeker’s
                allowance as they are classed as full-time for social security
                purposes. That will undoubtedly create another group of students
                who are excluded from any kind of financial support.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also concerned about the Social Security
                Advisory Committee’s recommendations. It pointed out that
                people in full-time education should not be deprived of the
                right to any guarantee of support if their studies are
                interrupted for valid reasons. Those reasons could be other than
                ill health and caring. Consideration could be given to people
                who have had to leave their courses because of pregnancy,
                bereavement or other reasons. I am also concerned about lone
                parents, who lose their entitlement to benefits as soon as the
                youngest child reaches&nbsp;16. The Social Security Advisory
                Committee recommended that entitlement to income support for
                lone parents should be extended while they are in full-time
                education. I also believe that there was not enough consultation
                with student groups such as NUS-USI. To what extent has
                consultation taken place?</p>

                The Social Security Advisory Committee fulfils a role for
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland similar to that for Great&nbsp;Britain. It
                invites views from Northern&nbsp;Ireland when conducting
                consultation on the equivalent Great&nbsp;Britain Regulations.
                The Committee states that corresponding Northern&nbsp;Ireland
                Regulations are to be made and takes into account views
                expressed by any Northern&nbsp;Ireland interests. I emphasise
                that the consultation process was carried out by the Social

                consulted. I will take a look at it again and come back to the
                Chairperson of the Committee about it. With regard to student
                requirements, the regulator’s advice is to keep the student in

                experience to deliver a broad and balanced curriculum. High
                priority will continue to be given to the replacement of rural

                allocated, and the range of pupils that should be included in

                communities, the same criterion will be applied to them as he
                proposes to apply to Irish language schools? If there is an
                intake of 12, will he be prepared to fund such schools, or are
                we going to see a difference in the way that the Minister deals

                fewer pupils than the levels envisaged in the proposed new
                viability criteria for Irish-medium and integrated schools. In
                cases in which we are considering building new schools in rural
                areas, we already use a minimum enrolment of 85 pupils as our
                basic criterion. My proposals for Irish-medium and integrated
                schools will therefore merely provide them with equality of

                educational experience for pupils as is available in larger
                schools. Such schools can require additional support over a
                sustained period to help minimise any educational disadvantages
                to their pupils. A consultation document will be issued early in
                the new year setting out proposals for a new common formula to
                be used in the allocation of resources to all schools, including
                small schools. It will give us an opportunity to deal with some

                there have been attacks on small schools in the past two weeks

                another on the Comhaltas Ghaelscoil Dhál Riada in north Antrim,
                which I visited this morning. It was sad to see children in
                their school uniform unable to attend their school because
                someone thought a cause — whatever that cause was — could be
                served by the burning of a school. It is incumbent upon
                everybody in the Assembly, particularly elected representatives
                and leading citizens in the north Antrim area, to make it clear
                to the people involved in such arson attacks — whether on
                Irish- language schools, Irish cultural establishments, Orange
                halls or church property — that such behaviour is absolutely

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much of that will depend on the nature of the
                review, the terms of reference and what the Executive agree as
                the best way forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Obviously, other Departments have a direct
                interest in educational issues and structures — the Department
                of Culture, Arts and Leisure has a particular interest in
                library services — so the Department of Education cannot act
                unilaterally. Undoubtedly, as we stated in the Programme for
                Government, there is consensus on the need for a wide-ranging
                review of local government. When the Executive decide on the
                terms of reference for that review, we will deal with the issues
                relating to the existing bodies in order to improve our
                education services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have not yet given any consideration to
                payments for school governors. If people wish to make a case, we
                will consider it within the context of a wide-ranging review.</p>

                Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment and the Council for
                Catholic Maintained Schools? Given that it is in the Programme
                for Government and that each ministerial Department will be
                charged to bring forward its review proposals, can the Minister
                state when he will do so?</p>

                will come back to the issue before Christmas. I cannot decide
                that on my own. The review, when it is announced, will have to
                be wide-ranging. We should consider all the bodies within
                education, and we should aim to improve our education system in
                order to direct services straight into the classroom.</p>

                educational perspective, we want a wide-ranging review in order

                of the objectives of the theme is to provide pupils with
                first-hand experience of commerce and industry. The CCEA has
                embarked on a review of curriculum provisions, with a view to
                meeting the educational needs of young people in the new
                millennium. As part of that review, it is proposed to provide a
                specific programme for employability as a statutory entitlement
                for all young people in post-primary schools. There has been
                widespread consultation with employers to ensure that their

                Does the Minister recognise the importance of small businesses

                from the grant culture? Will he consider what steps his

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Links between business and education are
                vitally important. In the context of the review of the
                curriculum, all the matters that the Member raised will be
                seriously addressed. We are working closely with bodies such as
                Young Enterprise, the Northern Ireland Science and Technology
                Regional Organisation, and Industry Matters. Those bodies offer
                a wide range of programmes linking schools with business. Such
                programmes are of great benefit to pupils and teachers and
                undoubtedly deepen their understanding of the world of business.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Business education partnerships play an
                important role in developing local partnerships and provide a
                mechanism whereby schools can make themselves aware of the range
                and nature of businesses in their locality. They make employers
                aware of their role in preparing pupils for life after school
                and maximise the input from employers in such work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The number of women in business is an
                important issue. It is a matter for us but also for trade and
                industry and for the Department of Higher and Further Education,
                Training and Employment. People are focused on the importance of
                the subject. Recently, I was involved in the presentation of an
                ‘Irish Times’ award at the Royal Irish Academy in Dublin, at
                which three pupils from the North swept the board in a chemistry
                competition. Two of the winners were from my constituency, and
                all of them were female, which was an added bonus. It is
                important that we interest everybody, male and female, in this
                matter.</p>

                organisation is available across Northern Ireland? Furthermore,
                will he give special encouragement to schools to come together
                from different backgrounds, particularly from North and South,
                to discuss business enterprise?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Organisations such as Young Enterprise
                provide an important range of programmes that link schools with
                business. It is important that we continue to encourage people
                — not just in schools, but in industry and business — to
                recognise the importance of business education partnerships.
                That battle has been won. Every school that I visit — even
                primary schools — shows an increasing awareness of the need to
                go down that route.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also important that we continue to
                build our links with other parts of this island. Schools should
                maintain contact with schools in other parts of the island so
                that they can learn from their different experiences. Everybody
                agrees that education played a major role in the growth of the
                &quot;Celtic tiger&quot; economy in the South. We have a lot to
                learn. I am convinced that we will continue to build on those
                relationships.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also important that we continue to
                build relationships across the community here in the North. It
                gives me particular pleasure to inform the Assembly that schools
                everywhere are recognising the need to bridge the community
                divide. They are doing that very successfully.</p>

                address the problem of Moneydarragh Primary School at Annalong?
                He is aware that that excellent school, with an increasing roll,
                has been long starved of funding and has not yet received any
                favourable response from the Department. He is also aware that a
                decision must be made quickly, because of local land
                circumstances. At another level, his Department has already
                accepted the need, as a matter of some urgency, for an extension
                to and refurbishment of the Assumption Grammar School in
                Ballynahinch. Can that also be given some priority? Neither of
                those schemes can afford to wait until the review process next

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department’s appraisal work programme
                for the current financial year is fully committed. It will,
                however, consider the inclusion of the Moneydarragh Primary
                School project in its programme of appraisals for 2001-02,
                depending on other competing priorities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand the case made by Mr McGrady in
                relation to Assumption Grammar School, but we all know that
                throughout the North there are many competing priorities for the
                schools capital building programme. We will certainly consider
                Assumption Grammar School in the school capital building
                programme next year, but that will obviously depend on the
                resources available.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If people have been listening to the radio
                and watching the television news recently, they will know that
                there are many demands on our finances for the school capital
                building programme throughout the North. When a decision is
                taken, it will be solely on the basis of educational need, but
                with a view towards fitting in as many urgent cases as we can.
                Since the establishment of the Executive, my views on the poor
                state of our school stock and the need to improve it have gone
                on record. People know the quantity of money that is required to
                do that. We can do only a certain amount in any given year, but
                early next year we will announce the school capital building
                programme, and we will attempt to facilitate as many people as
                possible in the light of the limited resources available to us.</p>

                education for our young people. The Council for the Curriculum,
                Examination and Assessment (CCEA) is currently undertaking a
                review of the curriculum here, taking into account the changing
                needs of pupils, society and the economy in the new millennium.
                The council has highlighted the issue of citizenship education
                as part of this review and has been given approval to begin
                development work on a programme covering education for democracy
                and citizenship. It is proposed that that programme will focus
                on years 8 to 10, and it will cover diversity and
                interdependence, including community identity, conflict and
                reconciliation, and social and civic responsibilities. It will
                also deal with the issue of equality and justice, including
                human rights, inclusion and sustainable development, democracy
                and active participation.</p>

                other things — are fundamental elements of decent living? Does
                he agree that society as a whole would benefit from such an
                addition to the curriculum?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree that our young people would benefit
                from a comprehensive approach to the issue of citizenship and to
                the effective provision of processes to enable young people to
                appreciate their environment. The most important thing of all is
                the valuable contribution that they have to make to the
                community. I have often said that our most valuable resource is
                our children. There is no doubt about that. We have a
                responsibility to provide the best and most wide-ranging
                education that we can.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I said in response to an earlier question,
                our young people are tremendous. The more that I visit schools
                and meet young people from right across the community, the more
                it becomes clear that young people appreciate the transformation
                that our society has undergone recently. They appreciate the
                Good Friday Agreement and understand the challenges that it
                poses, not just for politicians, but for themselves. They have
                risen to that challenge and accepted that the new way forward is
                for them. The more that we encourage that in the school
                curriculum, the greater the benefits will be for all of us in

                last winter. In Belfast, that expansion means an increase of
                three paediatric intensive care beds at the Royal Group of
                Hospitals and two intensive care beds at the Ulster Hospital. To
                complement those intensive care services, high-dependency
                provision is also being increased. At the Royal Group of
                Hospitals, where there are no high-dependency beds at present,
                five will come on stream on 1&nbsp;December. The Belfast City
                Hospital Trust’s existing complement of two high-dependency
                beds is being increased to six, again from 1&nbsp;December, and
                the Ulster Hospital, which had no high-dependency provision, has
                had three high-dependency beds since 1&nbsp;November.</p>

                is happening now. I hope that the necessary measures will be put
                in place now. As well as high-dependency beds, adequate staff
                are required. As the Minister may know, well-trained Filipino
                nurses are working in the Ulster Hospital. Although we

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree that it is a question not merely of

                working hard to ensure that additional staff, particularly
                nursing staff, are available. In the short term, boards have put
                in place a Return to Practice programme under which more than
                100 additional nursing staff will be available. For the
                longer-term, an additional 100 nurse training places have been

                geriatric unit on the South Tyrone Hospital site. Those beds

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The people of south Tyrone will find that a
                strange reply. Last year, we were told that Craigavon Area
                Hospital could cope with the workload previously dealt with by
                South Tyrone Hospital, and it came as some surprise that all our
                beds were used. It is interesting to find that we only have six
                down this year. I ask the Minister to assure to the Assembly and
                the people in south Tyrone that she will re-examine the current
                status of the services that have been temporarily transferred
                see if they can be reinstated, rather than just to provide the
                six beds that she spoke about.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Temporary transfer was made for specific
                reasons, and those reasons have not changed. Specific measures
                have been put in place in Craigavon to tackle winter pressures.
                The capacity of the intensive care and high dependency unit at
                Craigavon Area Hospital is being expanded. There are currently
                four intensive care beds and two high dependency beds in the
                unit, and arrangements are being made to increase that provision
                by 50%, to six intensive care and three high dependency beds.
                Dedicated patient transport vehicles will also speed up hospital
                transfers and discharges.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several strong measures have been taken.
                Boards and trusts have been working hard to ensure that
                contingency arrangements are made for this winter. With regard
                to the long-term future of the South Tyrone Hospital, I have
                made it clear that no decisions will be taken until the
                independent review group chaired by Maurice Hayes has reported.</p>

                First of all, the Minister will remember that she instructed
                John Templeton, the chief executive of Craigavon Area Hospital,
                to rebalance services between the Craigavon and South Tyrone
                hospitals. At present, private clinics such as the Ulster Clinic
                are being used and beds are being transferred from Craigavon to
                them. Can the Minister tell us the cost to the Health Service of
                that? Why are the new theatres in South Tyrone Hospital not
                being used for that very purpose? I am certain that they are
                just as well equipped as the Ulster Clinic, or any other private
                clinic.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms de Brún:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of the measures that were outlined at
                that time, for the responsibilities that Craigavon Area Hospital
                will take on, will be implemented only from 1&nbsp;December.
                However, I must make it clear that the Department has been in
                contact with the board and has emphasised that it wishes to see
                a rebalancing of services between the two hospitals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With reference to the question about the use
                of private facilities, around 57 patients waiting for surgical
                procedures have been identified for possible treatment by the
                board at the Ulster Independent Clinic. The board has also made
                it clear that it considered alternatives to the Ulster
                Independent Clinic. Those were fully explored, and the board is
                satisfied that there was no realistic alternative at the South
                Tyrone Hospital or elsewhere. My Department and I expect all
                reasonable potential options for treating patients in health and
                personal social services facilities to be tested first. From
                conversations that officials have had with the board, I
                understand that the main factor preventing the use of the South
                Tyrone Hospital for those 57 patients has been the need for
                overnight clinical cover for recovering patients.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand that a range of treatments is
                still being negotiated with alternative providers, including the
                private sector, and that the board expects to obtain a
                cost-effective package for those procedures that will represent
                good value for money for the patient and the Department.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is evident from the answer that we are
                paying nurses on the cheap in Northern Ireland, with 13% more
                nurses at D grade than in England. It is clear that that is one
                reason why so many nurses are leaving.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes, there is. It is clear that that is one
                of the main reasons for the nursing crisis and for our having to
                import nurses from all over the world. What will the Minister do
                to ensure that nurses are rewarded fairly for the work that they
                do?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms de Brún:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member has obviously not read the front
                pages of the English newspapers, which tell us of the grave
                shortages of nurses throughout that country, and which slightly
                belie the point he appears to be trying to make. The grading of
                any nursing post depends on the duties of the post; length of
                service, experience and qualifications are not in the agreed
                criteria. Therefore, no direct comparison can be made between
                the numbers of grade D posts in different countries, as the
                number depends on the staffing requirements of individual
                organisations to deliver health care to service users.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The clinical grading system and pay for
                nurses and others working in the system have been addressed in
                the House several times. The four health boards, in partnership
                with employers and staff organisations, are currently developing
                proposals for a new pay system. It will offer staff a more
                attractive career with the potential for better progression,
                greater use of skills, improved status and higher earnings for
                those who contribute most to the service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is proposed that a job evaluation scheme
                will be used to evaluate every post in the Health Service, and
                pay will be awarded on the basis of a job’s worth in fair
                comparison with the worth of other jobs.</p>

                taking folic acid when pregnant or when intending to become
                pregnant. The kind of publicity given to that vital health
                promotion campaign could not have been paid for. Having the

                Northern Ireland hospitals, but those in other parts of the UK
                — stating that many patients contract fatal illnesses while in
                hospital, surely those startling figures make it incumbent upon
                all hospital staff to have the vaccination.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The influenza vaccine is effective in
                preventing influenza, but it will not have any impact on other
                causes of viral illness. It is hoped that there will be less
                staff absence as a result of flu. In any given winter, it is
                difficult to predict how much influenza and other viral illness
                there will be in the community. It is therefore difficult to
                predict the level of staff absence due to these conditions.
                Staff immunisation will reduce staff absence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Scotland, the uptake of vaccinations
                samong health care staff is not monitored centrally. Trusts in
                Wales have not been asked to immunise health workers and are not
                collecting the information centrally. In Northern Ireland, we
                have monitored the uptake of the vaccine, and the boards and
                trusts organised the influenza vaccination programme for staff.
                All HPSS staff were notified of the vaccination programmes by
                several different measures, including advertisements in hospital
                newsletters, personal invitations through clinic lists and
                payslips. We continue to monitor the uptake of the vaccine among
                staff, and boards and trusts have been asked to forward
                information on uptake levels and details of how their
                information and immunisation programmes are being organised and
                promoted. However, it is a voluntary measure. To ensure
                accessibility, immunisation clinics have been organised at a
                variety of locations and times. Some trusts have also organised
                special clinics for night staff.</p>

                impact on other causes of viral illness. It is an important part
                of our efforts to minimise winter pressures from influenza, but
                it is impossible to state exactly what will happen. They are
                precautionary measures. We are taking clear measures, and
                television advertisements and other campaigns were used to
                ensure uptake, because this year the vaccine is offered to the
                over-65s. The uptake is 57%.</p>

                announcements made in July, the First Minister, the Deputy First
                Minister and I had some success in making representations for an
                improvement to the allocation that Northern Ireland received
                under the Barnett formula. We improved our treatment of
                abatement of VAT in spending programmes. We also ensured that
                spending on the London underground would be included in the
                formula for the first time. Those changes were worth some £40
                million extra in each of the three years of the spending review.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the basis of further representations made
                subsequent to the spending review announcement, the Treasury
                also agreed to provide additional common agricultural policy
                funding for modulation payments, amounting to £3 million, £4
                million and £4·5 million respectively in the three years of

                decentralisation of Civil Service jobs in line with the
                commitments made in the draft Programme for Government and in
                the context of an accommodation review. The review will start as
                soon as possible after the receipt of an updated database of
                office accommodation commissioned from specialist consultants.
                The current target for completing the review, as set out in the
                Programme for Government, is June 2001. Pending the outcome,
                opportunities for relocation will be considered as they arise.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for his reply, which
                somewhat subverted my supplementary question. I am glad to hear
                that the office accommodation audit to which he referred will be
                completed by the middle of next year. In coming to his
                conclusions on decentralisation, will the Minister take on board
                the deficit of such jobs in many rural areas and the particular
                requirement to address social need? Following publication of the
                Minister’s report in June 2001, such matters will need to be
                addressed urgently.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recognise the valuable contribution that
                Civil Service jobs make to many locations. We shall take a range
                of factors into account, including the number of Civil Service
                jobs in an area as a proportion of the local workforce, new TSN
                indicators, the regional planning strategy, the effect on
                equality of opportunity and, not least, service delivery and
                business efficiency and, of course, cost. In trying to balance
                all those factors, we want the region as a whole and, in
                particular, the various locations within it, to benefit. We also
                want to ensure that we continue to enhance the quality and

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister agree that Newtownabbey,
                despite being the fourth-largest borough in Northern Ireland, is
                under-provided with Civil Service jobs and has suffered from a
                recent loss of Civil Service accommodation?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Newtownabbey incorporates a large rural
                hinterland, and farmers in that area are to be congratulated on
                forming the highly successful Ollardale co-operative. Given that
                worthy example of self-help, will the Minister undertake to look
                frequently and favourably at Newtownabbey as a rural community
                likely to maximise the benefits that might flow from any
                decentralisation?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be wrong of me to speculate about
                which areas might benefit as a result of whatever new policy
                might emerge from the review. Many areas have already been
                suggested as suitable locations for Civil Service jobs. We hope
                to bring forward a policy that will take account of a wide range
                of factors. I welcome the interest from a large number of areas
                in hosting Civil Service jobs and hope to see that interest
                reflected in the opportunities that might arise from the review.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the basis of the Minister’s personal
                experience in Derry, does he agree that the decentralisation of
                jobs is absolutely critical to the regeneration of all
                communities? Will he redress the disgraceful centralisation that
                took place during the dark years of direct rule?</p>

                about my own constituency. A further 20 Civil Service jobs in
                the pensions branch are to be located there, as a result of
                developments in the treatment of superannuation activities in
                some Departments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Civil Service jobs make a significant
                contribution in any locality. I recognise the strong case that
                many Members make that the benefits should be evenly spread
                across Northern Ireland. I also recognise the difficulties with
                congestion in Belfast. We are trying to bring forward an overall
                review of accommodation strategy. We are bringing forward a
                policy that is about providing the Northern Ireland Civil
                Service with the accommodation that it needs for its business
                and management purposes. We will be glad to ensure that, as far
                as possible, the efficient supply and deployment of
                accommodation helps to achieve other benefits across the region.</p>

                £955, £618, £477 and £1,113 respectively. I understand that
                the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety
                placed advertisements in Irish in a number of newspapers. It is
                for the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to
                answer any questions relating to advertisements placed by her
                Department. The Recruitment Service has received six

                not give the Assembly any figures for the other advertisement
                — is exceptionally high, given that the position has a salary
                scale of £31,000 to £52,000. It is a deplorable waste.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is for each Department, not the Minister
                of Finance and Personnel, to decide what advertising is
                appropriate, according to the needs of the Department. The cost
                of advertising is significant, but if we did not advertise the
                posts — or if we varied the money to be spent on advertising
                according to salary scales — the level of equality of
                opportunity and open access to vacancies would be open to
                greater question. It is standard practice — and there is
                guidance on that — that advertisements be placed in a range of
                newspapers so that they will come to the notice of everyone who
                is eligible to apply.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Recruitment Service has also recently
                launched a website that displays the details of every vacancy in
                the Civil Service, and I hope that it will be widely used. The
                site is useful, not just for people in the region, but for the
                many people who work elsewhere and who might have an interest in
                returning to work here. The service is accessible to people who
                cannot buy local newspapers.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will take questions 4 and 7 together.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The regional rate is levied uniformly at a
                standard rate in the pound across Northern Ireland. Its impact
                on households will depend on the net annual value ascribed to
                each property and on the economic circumstances of each
                household.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The existence of rate rebates, as part of the
                social security system, means that the impact is lessened for
                those in the lower income bands. In that sense, in taxation
                jargon, it becomes more progressive. It is recognised that the
                system can be made more progressive, and that will be considered
                in the proposed review of the rating system, as has already been
                signalled to the Assembly. The setting of the level of and
                increases in the regional rate is scheduled for equality impact
                assessment by the Department of Finance and Personnel’s draft
                equality scheme. That equality impact assessment is to be tied
                into the overall review of rating policy.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister says that he hopes to make the
                tax more progressive. I would prefer it if he recognised that
                the tax is quite regressive. It does not take into account the
                ability to pay and it hits those on fixed incomes, such as
                pensioners.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the light of the regressiveness and
                inequity of this tax, will the Minister assure the House that
                when he comes to reassess the Budget with his Executive
                colleagues, it will not be increased by the proposed 8%, thus
                ensuring that those who are less well off, whose position he
                tacitly recognises, will not be further crippled?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I suggested that at a certain level the rates
                could be seen to be more progressive than at other levels,
                because of the facility provided through the social security
                system. I am not claiming that the rates system overall is a
                progressive tax. When rate rebates are taken into account,
                research shows that the rates become more progressive in the
                lower half of the income distribution and that they are
                proportional for middle incomes and regressive in the higher
                part of income distribution. We are trying to improve the
                fairness of the rate burden on Northern Ireland’s households.
                That is one reason for the rating review.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recent research, based on the continuous
                household survey and the Robson index of deprivation at district
                council level, demonstrates a relationship between the degree of
                deprivation and the domestic regional rate burden per capita in
                district council areas and that the domestic regional rate
                burden per capita generally increases as the level of
                deprivation decreases. Therefore the picture is not as bad as
                the Member has painted it. That is not to say that there are no
                anomalies and inequities in the system that should be examined.
                In particular, I recognise the position of some older
                householders, especially if they are single occupants.</p>

                assure the House that the rating review will take account of
                equality impact assessment so that people will not be in the
                position that they are in at present? It is an unequal system.
                What is the present state of the rating review?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I repeat what I said in the original answer.
                As part of the Department of Finance and Personnel’s draft
                equality scheme, a commitment has been made for an equality
                impact assessment on the setting of the rates. It is sensible to
                tie that work in with the broader rating review. Proposals on
                that review will be brought forward soon. We want to re-examine
                how revenue is taken from Northern Ireland’s population to
                support public expenditure requirements. It is right that we
                make a contribution towards those public expenditure needs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We do not want a situation in which we seem
                to criticise the Barnett formula — as the Member’s Colleague
                did — or where we appear to call for the formula to be changed
                because we want more money from English taxpayers and, at the
                same time, say that extra money should not be raised through the
                rates from the local population. We cannot win both those
                arguments. A review is needed. The review will examine how money
                is raised and how any inequities in the present system might be
                relieved. The review must make sure that revenue is raised, as
                well as dealing with the problems of particular groups.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I trust that the review will take some
                cognisance of the difficulties of town centre traders as opposed
                to those in developments on the edges of towns. I am concerned
                about the equity of the distribution of finances raised from the
                regional rate, given that, in the main, the increases were
                intended for infrastructural improvement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I refer to the answer to Mr McGrady’s
                question about the decentralisation of Civil Service
                accommodation. There is a commitment to e-government in the
                Programme for Government. Therefore it is important that the
                infrastructure for e-government is in place throughout Northern
                Ireland. Will finance be made available for broadband
                infrastructural development throughout Northern Ireland?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member’s supplementary question took
                the scenic route around the points that we passed on the way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the review, we are trying to ensure that
                we have a rates system that delivers money for public
                expenditure services and does so in a way that the ratepayers
                find fair. It is also important that the money be spent in ways
                that the people believe to be fair and equitable. That is a
                constant challenge in our resource and spending planning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member will be aware that there are
                proposed Executive programme funds in the Budget. One of those
                funds relates to infrastructure and capital renewal. We also
                said in the draft Budget statement that telecommunications is an
                area that might be addressed or assisted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member will also be aware that the
                Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment,
                Sir&nbsp;Reg&nbsp;Empey, is sponsoring an information-age
                initiative and has made a commitment to the entire region in

                rateable value caused for small businesses a couple of years
                ago, especially for shops on arterial routes, will the Minister
                bear in mind in this review the regressive effect of the rates
                system, especially on retail business?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The review of rating policy and processes
                that we are talking about is separate from the non-domestic
                revaluation that I announced previously. That work is now being
                undertaken, but the results of the revaluation will not feed
                into rating bills until 2003.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We want to carry out a non-domestic
                revaluation now because we have learnt the lessons from the last
                one. Things had been left so long from the previous revaluation
                that there were considerable swings in the rateable valuation.
                Everybody affected at that time said that future revaluations
                should be regular and timely. We hope to do that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People are already saying that some of the
                last revaluations have been overtaken by developments, not least
                the change in retail patterns. That is another argument in
                favour of a timely non-domestic revaluation.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is an opportunity to bring to the

                that we might have had the opportunity to bring the matter up a
                few weeks ago, but we were unable to do so. However, the
                opportunity has been granted today, and Members have a chance to
                voice support for the Fire Brigades Union, the Fire Brigade and
                those who work therein.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motto of the Fire Service is
                &quot;unitate fortior&quot; — unity is our strength. It is
                appropriate and sums up the motion before us today. It was
                adopted in 1973 when the Belfast Fire Service and the Northern
                Ireland Fire Service amalgamated. The Fire Service has faced the
                worst evils that man could throw at it. Along with the RUC and
                the Army, the Fire Service has borne the brunt of the atrocities
                that occurred during 30 years of troubles. Members will recall
                some of the worst atrocities: the Remembrance Day service bomb
                blast in Enniskillen; the Droppin’ Well at Ballykelly; the
                Abercorn Restaurant; Bloody Friday in Oxford Street; La Mon
                House Hotel in Castlereagh; McGurk’s Bar; the Shankill Road;
                and Omagh. The loss of life at those terrible incidents was
                horrendous, and members of the Fire Service, along with others,
                scrambled through the rubble and debris to find anyone still
                alive. They were also there to give urgent medical attention and
                support to those still alive or close to death. That was life in
                the Fire Service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Men and women from both sides of the
                community served all the people bearing the brunt of terrorist
                attacks, without thought for themselves. Nine members of the
                Fire Service were killed, and thousands more were injured as a
                result of dedication to their job and to their vocation. The
                injuries are not only physical; many members of the Fire Service
                have suffered from post- traumatic stress disorder, and many
                still suffer. That was first diagnosed after the Gulf War and
                the Falklands War, but you do not have to be in the Army, the
                Navy or the Air Force to suffer from post-traumatic stress
                disorder. Some Fire Service personnel are shadows of their
                former selves because of that disorder. Can you imagine the
                effect of carrying dead children out of a bomb site or attending
                to those who have sustained horrific burns, with many others
                blown to pieces? In some of the worst incidents, the only way to
                collect the bodies was with a shovel and a bag. That would have
                a serious effect on anyone’s mind. Many members of the Fire
                Service suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, with little
                or no prospect of getting better. We cannot, and should not,
                forget them. Today we have the opportunity to put things right.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Did the outrages end with the peace process
                and the agreement? The answer is &quot;No&quot;. Statistics show
                that the Fire Service has attended just as many, if not more,
                civil disturbance incidents since 1996. The highest number of
                incidents took place in 1998. Those figures equal the worst of
                the 30&nbsp;years of the troubles. During that time of war and
                savage violence, the Fire Service carried out its work with true
                dedication and loyalty to the whole Province. Firefighters
                served everyone in Northern Ireland, right across the spectrum.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are currently 2,000&nbsp;members of the
                Fire Service. Fifty-five per cent are full-time, and
                45%&nbsp;are part-time. There are also many who have retired or
                who have had to give up service for medical reasons — for
                example, post-traumatic stress disorder. The Fire Service has
                given much, without the financial or manpower resources of fire
                services in other parts of the United&nbsp;Kingdom. Essex, which
                is only 30% of the size of Northern&nbsp;Ireland and has a
                smaller population, has a larger budget, more up-to-date fire
                equipment and more full-time firefighters than
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland and can call on the help of its
                neighbours, Sussex and Suffolk. In Northern Ireland, the Fire
                Service attended almost 10,000&nbsp;more incidents in one year
                than that in Essex. That illustrates the shortfall.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Northern Ireland Fire Service has worked
                above and beyond the call of duty. It is totally committed to
                serving the whole community. It carried out its duties while it
                was under-resourced and sometimes undermanned. It gave best
                value in the past, gives it now and will continue to give it in
                the future. For those reasons, it is important for the Assembly
                to make representations to the Secretary of State for a state
                award.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my discussions with the Fire Service, the
                Fire Authority, other Members and constituents, all have said to
                me that they want a state award that will reflect accurately the
                esteem in which the Fire Service is held. A corporate award,
                perhaps in the form of a stained-glass window in a public
                building or a monument in a public place, would also show
                recognition, but we want a state medal to reflect public
                opinion. We want to see a medal struck by royal warrant that
                could be worn on a tunic in special recognition of all that the
                Fire Service has done. The Secretary of State could make such an
                award under his delegated powers, and we urge him to do so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Fire Brigades Union and the Fire
                Authority are united in the belief that the correct way to show
                recognition is through a state medal. That is something that the
                citizens of Northern Ireland would agree with. I have been
                inundated with requests from constituents who want the Fire
                Service to receive a state medal as recognition. In the 30 years
                of the troubles and subsequently, the Fire Service has shown
                dedication and commitment to the job at hand. Without concern
                for their safety, members have shown singular courage and energy
                in safeguarding property and saving lives with limited resources
                and manpower. Their work has saved countless lives. Today, many
                owe their lives to an unknown firefighter who was simply doing
                his job, without looking for special treatment. They are humble
                men and women doing their best for society. They deserve a state
                metal struck under royal warrant.</p>

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amendment is in keeping with what was
                decided at last week’s Executive meeting. It is also in line
                with the statement that the Minister made this morning. About an
                hour ago, that statement was warmly welcomed on television by
                the Fire Brigades Union. I spoke to some of its members before
                coming into the Chamber, and they warmly welcomed the Minister’s
                statement. Mr&nbsp;Shannon is 100% right when he talks about the
                dedication to duty shown by those people. Some of them have
                pulled people out of burning bars, and it is an awful indictment
                of our society that they have had to undergo such traumatic
                incidents over and above the type of fires that a fireman
                ordinarily has to deal with. Firemen have been left to pick up
                the pieces of some of the most horrific acts of violence. I
                agree that there is a need to recognise what they have done, but
                better terms and conditions would be important steps towards
                achieving that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Shannon referred to the lack of
                numbers. In some cases, fire crews should be strengthened to
                enable them to do their job fully. The amendment will not
                preclude any further award, and it will allow us, as an
                Assembly, to make an award without requiring
                Peter&nbsp;Mandelson’s permission. It will allow us to
                recognise the work that those people have done for this country
                over the years. In that spirit, I hope that the amendment will
                be well supported. We are not trying to score any points, but we
                need to present something that those people can say was awarded
                to them by the Assembly. Whether that takes the form of some
                kind of medal or a scroll is not for me to decide. However, the
                Assembly should institute some such award.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I and, indeed, my party are not normally in
                favour of political backslapping or giving awards. However, we
                believe that this case stands on its own merits. The service of
                the Fire Brigade and the men and women — unfortunately there
                are not all that many women — who risk their life should be
                recognised. If the amendment is accepted, that will in no way
                stop any further award being given by the Secretary of State. It
                would be an award made by the Assembly in recognition of the
                work done by the firefighters of this country. At a later date,
                as was suggested in the Minister’s statement this morning, it
                could be a matter for the Executive, through the Office of the
                First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, to recommend, in
                consultation with the Fire Brigade, any subsequent awards. Our
                positions are probably not all that far apart, but I believe
                that, as an Assembly, we should be allowed to express ourselves
                in favour of the people who elected us and be able to recognise
                those people who have served our community rather than be
                totally dependent on the Secretary of State, who, ultimately, is
                not bound to accept any recommendation that the Assembly makes.</p>

                The Minister told the Assembly in June that many people owed
                their life to the courage and skill of our firefighters and the
                important contribution of brigade support staff. She said that
                she and her Executive colleagues wanted to recognise such
                outstanding service in an appropriate and acceptable way. I
                endorse that statement. It is important that we keep the award
                to the Fire Service separate from the extraneous political
                undertones coming from the DUP. Is the striking of a medal about
                symbolism rather than about honouring the firemen who serve the
                entire community? Is the striking of a medal to the firemen an
                indication that the Fire Service belongs to only one section of
                the community? That would dishonour the Fire Service and make it
                difficult for people from my community to support or join it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have already witnessed a culture of
                discrimination in the Fire Service that made it difficult for
                young Nationalists — young Catholics — to join. It was
                difficult because of the culture that had been created around
                the Fire Service by successive Unionist establishments and an
                attempt to perpetuate — <i>[Interruption]. </i>It is cultural
                discrimination, and when I spoke to the firemen’s union even
                they admitted that over the years there had been an imbalance

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my opening paragraph I asked &quot;Is the
                striking of the medal about symbolism?&quot; If it is, then it
                is a divisive instrument that perpetuates the notion among
                Nationalists that there has been a culture of discrimination in
                the Fire Service. It is as simple as that. That fact was
                acknowledged by the firemen’s union when we had discussions
                with it and it hopes to redress it. The awarding of a medal with
                royal assent will not encourage young Nationalists to join the
                Fire Service, and neither does flying a flag over a fire
                station.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we are to pursue that course, we will
                create further division in the Fire Service. I was asking
                whether the striking of a medal would engender further division
                in an already divided community. We would better serve the
                community by getting behind an award to the Fire Service that
                has the full support of the Assembly, rather than one party’s
                using honour for the Fire Service to promote its own divisive
                political agenda.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have heard time and time again from all
                parties about the need to strike out locally, to cure the ills
                of our Health Service, our education service and other elements
                of our infrastructure. This is a glorious opportunity for us, as
                an Assembly, to strike out on our own and devise some manner of
                rewarding, as honourably and completely as we can, the
                sacrifices that the Fire Service has made over the years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would also like to make a point about the
                culture of discrimination in the Fire Service that is perceived
                by the Nationalist community. I refer to the poor representation
                of women.</p>

                outside influences. This is our chance to honour the integrity,
                loyalty, good work and sacrifices of the Fire Service over the
                years.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the amendment. I would like to
                welcome members of the Fire Brigades Union who are, I think, in
                the Public Gallery. They have spoken to many Members today, and
                I hope that they will find the debate useful. I support the
                amendment, because I feel that the DUP’s motion is restricting
                both the Assembly and the Secretary of State, as my own did some
                weeks ago. However, I hope that the motion will be debated in
                the right atmosphere and that the firefighters of Northern
                Ireland will be left in absolutely no doubt that Assembly
                Members agree that there should be due recognition of the
                dedication, commitment and sacrifice of firefighters, past and
                present, on behalf of all the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When devolution was achieved, the Department
                of Health, Social Services and Public Safety was given the task
                of organising such an award. Accordingly, the Minister issued a
                statement in June that the award would be made. I quote from the
                beginning of her statement:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;I wish to advise Members of the
                arrangements being made to pay tribute to the exceptional
                service of the Fire Service over the last 30 years.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That followed a meeting of the Executive,
                during which the Minister spoke in a way similar to that in
                which she has spoken today, and which underlined the sense of
                appreciation of the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the benefits of devolution is that we,
                as local representatives, could create some sort of appropriate
                award that would not preclude a decision by the Secretary of
                State to make a state award. We should be able to make our own
                decisions. Are we not mature enough to do that?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Fire Brigades Union was supportive of the
                state awards made to the RUC and the prison officers. It was
                felt that, if the efforts of firefighters were to be properly
                recognised, their award should be of a similar stature. I have
                spoken to many firefighters from all over Northern Ireland, and
                they realise that there would be a difference between a
                corporate award and a state one. However, they would like both,
                if possible. These firefighters also said that it would be nice
                to be the first recipients of such an award from the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Firefighting is a dangerous and potentially
                life- threatening undertaking. It is considerably more dramatic
                and varied than, for example, the picture painted by the
                television programme ‘London’s Burning’. There has been
                loss of life and serious injury throughout the brigade’s
                history. In my constituency last week, firefighters arrived at a
                scene to be greeted by two gunmen who would not let them near
                the blaze, despite the fact that things were happening that
                might have resulted in loss of life.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is, I regret to say, a service that the
                public tends to take for granted. Firefighters are not just
                expected to put out fires and rescue people; they also have to
                rescue kittens up trees, free children from railings, help those
                who have been locked out of or inside buildings and aid those
                trapped in the aftermath of a road traffic accident. But for the
                efforts of the brigade, horrors such as La Mon, Abercorn and the
                others mentioned would have been even more horrific. I remind
                Members of the film footage that we have seen over the years of
                the troubles, with buildings crumbling in flames as they did in
                wartime. What was and is the first line of defence called upon
                to try to save both life and property? It is the Fire Brigade.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We, as an Assembly representing the people of
                Northern Ireland, cannot allow their efforts to be overlooked or
                undervalued as we move towards a new future for all of us. Such
                a future has been made possible by the bravery and selflessness
                of the men and women who protected our community from peril. The
                Fire Brigades Union has had meetings with the Minister of
                Health, Social Services and Public Safety. It was encouraged by
                her attitude. Today’s statement shows her prompt action in
                dealing with the matter. She will obviously make significant
                efforts to impress upon the Secretary of State the need to give
                serious consideration to the state’s giving appropriate
                recognition to the firefighters. The Office of the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister will also consider what
                is appropriate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is fully within the remit of the Secretary
                of State to decide whether a state award should be made to the
                firefighters, but if it is decided that an Assembly medal is an
                appropriate award at this time, it will be the first ever. It
                will be locally decided and locally supported and, as such, will
                carry the heartfelt thanks of all the people of Northern Ireland
                with it. In its own way, that could be extremely hard to improve
                on, but a state award would be something that could still be
                considered. I have had many requests from firefighters. They
                maintain that they would be pleased to accept either, although
                more pleased to accept both.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the Minister’s statement will
                be unanimously supported. That will ensure that the Minister,
                the Secretary of State and the Office of the First Minister and
                the Deputy First Minister are all fully aware of the views of
                the Assembly, its Members and the people of Northern Ireland
                whom they represent. Our priority must be the recognition of all
                firefighters, past and present, who have kept our people and
                society safe and protected life and property throughout
                difficult times and against all odds. In spite of other
                problems, such as funding and manpower — and gender issues, I
                have to say — our priority must be the recognition of all
                firefighters who have played their demanding role to help us.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is sad that the DUP cannot put the wishes
                of the firefighters ahead of its own political agenda. I hope
                that they will do that. I hope that all Members will speak on
                relevant matters today, and not use the debate as a vehicle for
                criticism or comment on others. To do so would be to do no
                service to those whom we have come here to support: the Fire
                Brigade, the firefighters, men and women of Northern Ireland.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ervine:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sure that the Fire Brigades Union
                wondered for a moment whether we were the right people to be
                talking about this when we began — or lapsed into — what
                seemed to be a divisive debate. I do not recognise the Fire
                Service described by Mr J Kelly. I could never imagine a
                postcode area where they would not go, or a house or a life that
                they would not attempt to save.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr J Kelly:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was not suggesting that, a LeasCheann
                Comhairle. What I said was that employment levels in the Fire
                Service did not adequately represent the Nationalist and
                Unionist make-up of our population, and that there was a chill
                factor, a culture of discrimination, against Nationalists’
                joining the Fire Service.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ervine:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Against the backdrop of attempting to
                encourage the Assembly, and therefore society, the Member was
                not required to introduce such a negative element, regardless of
                how much he is wedded to that belief.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My understanding of firefighters is that we
                should value them all, no matter where they have served. We have
                seen them coping with terrible circumstances. The morning might
                begin with taking someone who has been decapitated out of a road
                traffic accident. In the afternoon, a child might be found —
                perfect, untouched, but asphyxiated by smoke. A firefighter has
                to carry that child out to all of those who will grieve. Those
                are the normal circumstances of the Fire Service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then, there is the unavoidable accidental
                horror, the avoidable accidental horror and the wanton
                destruction. Our society, unlike many others, has all three. The
                Fire Service is at the front of those who have to go — those
                who go on our behalf. I am pleased that the Minister has
                recognised the Fire Service and that there is recognition from
                all parts of the House. It is vital that the British
                Administration also recognise the sacrifice of the Fire Service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jim Shannon and Danny O’Connor referred to
                resources and to the circumstances under which the Fire Service
                functions. They save the British Exchequer billions of pounds
                under difficult circumstances, never measuring the risk to
                themselves. Some of us who have been close to victims that the
                Fire Service has had to deal with might look at such things
                somewhat differently. Accountants at Westminster look at it on
                the basis of what they have to pay out, for example, to give
                Essex perfect Fire Service cover. Northern Ireland gets the
                crumbs off the table.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our men have been fighting the battle under
                those circumstances for many years. That is bad enough for a
                normal Fire Service. If it is a Fire Service in a place apart
                — Northern Ireland — suffering wanton destruction and the
                resultant horror, how much more significant is recognition by
                that Government of the Fire Service’s dedication under awful
                circumstances? They were under- resourced, but they behaved as
                they were expected to behave. Do we not expect that of trained
                firemen? The Fire Service has served the community above and
                beyond the call of duty, taking into consideration the lack of
                resources. Others, who did not have the same trauma and
                difficulty to deal with, received better treatment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall make one final argument as to why it
                is so vital that there be a state award. Mr&nbsp;O’Connor said
                that his amendment did not preclude what Mr&nbsp;Shannon wanted.
                However, it is also true that Mr Shannon’s motion does not
                preclude what Mr O’Connor wants. There is no reason why the
                Minister could not approach the Secretary of State to make him
                aware of the depth of feeling about this. Meanwhile, back at the
                ranch, we could recognise the value of the work of the Northern
                Ireland Fire Service, even though we have only just assumed
                responsibility for it. The Minister should tell the Secretary of
                State or the Prime Minister that they would be as well to do the
                same — the honourable, decent thing. However, such a scenario
                was not forthcoming. That is a serious disappointment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have only just taken over responsibility
                for the Fire Service. The people who previously had the
                responsibility, and who ought to pay tribute, are at
                Westminster. Northern Ireland is a part of the United Kingdom,
                and the United Kingdom Exchequer benefited from the skills and
                tireless efforts of the Fire Service. It is fundamentally
                important that that recognition be complete, and that both
                Houses recognise the Fire Service. What harm would that do? Who
                would feel insulted? Fire Service personnel of both religions
                and none have risked their life saving others in every postcode
                area. The Fire Service had to deal with road traffic and other
                accidents, as well as the wanton destruction that was visited on
                our society by the troubles, irrespective of who caused it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My support for the motion does not mean that
                I feel wholly negatively towards the amendment. There is
                goodwill on these Benches. I appeal to the Minister to give
                serious consideration to lobbying on behalf of the Northern
                Ireland Fire Service. It would not go amiss and might settle the
                worries of Members who feel — probably wrongly — that there
                is some sinister reason to explain why the Minister is not
                prepared to do so.</p>

                amendment. As Mr Ervine said, we must look at both options.
                However, I would like to know what is meant by these words in
                the amendment:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;to examine any further awards&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want an explanation of what the Executive
                intend to put to the Secretary of State.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Throughout the 30 years of terrorism, the
                people of Northern Ireland had the good fortune to have a number
                of emergency services dedicated to the preservation of law and
                order and the protection of life and property. The exceptional
                dedication of members of the RUC and the suffering that they
                endured have been recognised by the award of the George Cross to
                the corporate body. That award was instituted in 1940 to honour
                great heroism and conspicuous courage. In August, the Secretary
                of State confirmed that approval in principle had been granted
                by the Queen to the award of a special medal to prison staff in
                Northern Ireland. That was also in recognition of the
                professionalism, bravery and commitment of prison staff in
                serving the community over the past difficult, and often
                dangerous, 30 years. That medal, unlike the George Cross, is to
                be awarded to serving and former prison staff who have served
                with the Northern Ireland Prison Service for at least five
                years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today, the Assembly is rightly debating how
                it can properly recognise the exceptional service given by
                part-time and full-time members of the Northern Ireland Fire
                Service. That service has been given over the past 30 years of
                terrorism in Northern Ireland and, indeed, extends to many
                duties beyond those linked to terrorism. Their basic duties of
                attending normal incidents — if one can call them normal —
                of fire and vehicle accidents have been hindered by increased
                call-outs due to terrorist attacks on community and business.
                Their dedication to duty must be rewarded. I am aware, in my
                constituency, of the horrors that part-time and full-time
                firemen have had to face in carrying out their duties. They are
                in action night after night, engaging in hazardous operations
                — many times at the mercy of the elements. Part-time
                volunteers have had to carry on with their normal jobs and
                businesses as well. Some tribute should also be paid to those
                employers who have allowed employees who are part-time firemen
                to go when the call arises.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1954, the Committee on the Grant of
                Honours, Decorations and Medals agreed the issue of the Fire
                Brigade Long Service and Good Conduct Medal, with the approval
                of the Queen. It is awarded for 20 years’ service with good
                conduct. In the same year, another medal was struck, and it was
                to be awarded to members of recognised fire brigades for
                distinguished service. That medal may also be posthumously
                awarded for gallantry, and was named the Queen’s Fire Medal. I
                believe that several officers in Northern Ireland have been
                honoured in that way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any award recognising the bravery of the Fire
                Service must be proper and adequate in status. I believe that a
                civic award is an insult. It has been rejected by the Fire
                Brigades Union and, indeed, by the Fire Authority itself. I
                welcome the fact that the Executive have recognised that a
                corporate award from the Assembly is more appropriate than the
                civic award first proposed. We have all received a note from the
                Fire Brigades Union highlighting the options that are available
                to the Assembly. One of the options that we are considering is
                to pursue corporate recognition within the purview of the
                Northern Ireland Assembly and, at the same time, making all
                possible efforts to achieve full state-endorsed recognition. I
                trust — I wait for the reply with reference to the amendment
                — that that is what is in the minds of those who are moving
                the amendment. Like Mrs Bell, I urge most fervently that the
                First Minister and Deputy First Minister pursue, through the
                Secretary of State, a proper state award for the Fire Service. I
                believe that it can be achieved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A state award granted by the Queen to
                recognise the professionalism, bravery and commitment of all
                members of our Fire Service during the past 30 years of the
                terrorist campaign is, without doubt, appropriate. I regret the
                remarks that we have heard about possible discrimination within
                the service. I am sure that if somebody is standing at a window
                or trapped in a car, the first question asked is not whether he
                is a Protestant, a Catholic, a Nationalist or a Unionist. The
                firefighters do not ask the person, and the person that they are
                helping does not ask them. It does not come into the question. I
                know many brave brigade members from both sides of the
                community, and I have never been aware of any discrimination
                within the service.</p>

                Service as has been granted to the Northern Ireland Prison
                Service. I further urge that the Assembly recognise the great
                service that the Northern Ireland Fire Service has given to the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dallat:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the proposers of the motion have the Fire
                Service and its interests at heart, they will have no problem
                accepting the amendment, because it offers greater flexibility
                than the motion. We are often accused of harking back to the
                past, but it is fair to say that the Fire Service began its life
                following the great fire of London in 1666. That was
                24&nbsp;years before the battle of the Boyne. The Fire Service
                has moved on since then — sometimes the motions before the
                House remain in that period.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nearly 30&nbsp;years ago, I was in
                Foyle&nbsp;Street in Derry while firemen dealt with a fire at
                the City Hotel. I was there not for the excitement but because
                two firemen were trapped inside. I am sad to say that they lost
                their lives. We must be careful not to make political capital
                out of the lives and deaths of firemen. We have a duty to
                respect them, and we have not done that today. The firemen do
                not want the issue to become yet another excuse for secretarian
                politics. They would prefer it to be settled in another way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The House did itself no favours whatsoever
                when news of a medal was first announced. In the mad rush to
                create sound bites and score political points, Members behaved
                in the most disgraceful manner. What a pity it is that those
                Members were not so vocal when the Fire Service was repeatedly
                attacked in their constituencies with stones and bottles. The
                Fire Service was not the issue then, and neither is it now. We
                must bear that in mind.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The decision to honour the Fire Service was
                initiated by the former Minister of the Environment,
                Lord&nbsp;Dubs, and acted upon by the present Minister of
                HSS&amp;PS, Ms&nbsp;de&nbsp;Brún, and there the matter should
                rest. To do otherwise is to do the opposite of what is proposed
                in the motion. No one disputes the great sacrifice and
                commitment to duty of members of the Fire Service. However, the
                issue should not become a political football, because that is
                not in anyone’s interest, and certainly not in the interest of
                the Fire Service. Members may know that the Northern Ireland
                Fire Service is currently experiencing difficulty recruiting new
                members, particularly in rural areas. Emergency calls are
                answered by skeleton crews, and that is of greater concern than
                political arguments about the origins of a medal. If we allow
                that controversy to continue, an even smaller number of
                volunteers will come forward, because when politicians get their
                grubby hands on organisations and politicise them, experience
                tells us that they do those services no favours.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Fire Service does not need such a
                controversial debate. Instead, it needs hard working politicians
                who are prepared to take as many risks in the interests of peace
                as they have done. Society views this type of motion as a
                time-wasting opportunity for gaining political capital at the
                expense of the services that Members claim to represent. In the
                past, another section of the emergency services was used for
                political purposes, namely the police service. Are we going to
                feed the Fire Service to the political vultures as well? I hope
                not.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the amendment. This is a one-off
                occasion, and I look forward to the implementation of the
                Minister’s proposals. I salute the Fire Service for the work
                that it has done, not just over the past 30 years but since its
                inception.</p>

                dedication and sacrifice of the Fire Service have not been
                recognised. It makes me sick sometimes to listen to the likes of

                is too serious for party politics. I remind Mr Dallat that the

                from the SDLP, Sinn Féin, the Alliance Party and the PUP. It
                also met the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public
                Safety, who is a member of Sinn Féin/IRA. Indeed, I spoke to
                the Fire Brigades Union myself today. We are not using this
                politically.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Fire Brigades Union represents 95% of
                uniformed Fire Service personnel and recommends a corporate
                award. It also stresses that it wants to see a state awarded
                medal for the Fire Service. That is the message that the DUP
                got, and I am sure that it is the message that the SDLP and
                other political parties also received — in no way was the Fire
                Brigades Union being political. It represents people of all
                backgrounds, including Roman Catholics, Protestants, those of
                other religions and people without religious belief.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today’s statement from the Minister
                included no com -mitment. She is making it the responsibility of
                the First and Deputy First Ministers to investigate whether a
                state award medal is possible or appropriate. The award of a
                state medal to the Fire Service is important, and I hope that
                the First and Deputy First Ministers will be recommending it to
                the Government and the Secretary of State rather than
                investigating whether it is appropriate or not.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must listen closely to what the Fire
                Service and its representatives want. I have consulted ordinary
                fire officers and the chief fire officer at his Lisburn
                headquarters, and I received a clear message from the latter
                that, while they recommend awards, they also want to be
                recognised with a state-awarded medal. It has been said
                repeatedly today that the Fire Service has served our community
                with great distinction. It has sacrificed a lot, and officers
                have lost colleagues in the line of duty.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Loved ones have lost their husbands and
                fathers because of the dedication with which they served the
                entire community. I find it regrettable that the question of
                discrimination was brought into the debate today. As the hon
                Member for West Tyrone (Mr Hussey) said, Fire Service officers
                never questioned whether a house was Roman Catholic or
                Protestant when they were at the scene. I say to Members who
                talk of discrimination that they should go to a place such as
                Crossmaglen and get a religious breakdown of those at the Fire
                Service station. Then we would know all about discrimination. It
                is ridiculous that the issue was brought into todays debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Firefighters responded to over 31,000
                incidents across Northern Ireland in 1999-2000, rescuing over
                700 people in road traffic accidents and other special service
                calls. In no way are we being political about the issue. It is
                because of the sacrifice, dedication and distinction with which
                the Fire Service has served the community that it should have a
                state-awarded medal. I call on the House to back the motion for
                such a medal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Health Minister’s statement does not go
                far enough. I am getting a clear message from the Fire Brigades
                Union that it will accept nothing less. I call on the House to
                support the motion, and I trust that the views of the Fire
                Brigades Union and all the ordinary fire officers throughout the
                country will be listened to, for they serve the entire community
                and have safeguarded our society over the past 30 years of the
                troubles.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dallat said that certain politicians were
                not quick to support the Fire Service when it was under attack
                from their own community. In this corner of the House, we state
                clearly that we are well aware that the Fire Service came under
                attack not only from the Republican or Nationalist community but
                from Loyalists: we condemn that outright. We condemn those in
                our own community who attacked the Fire Service, for it is a
                neutral service that has served the entire community in Northern
                Ireland. I condemn attacks carried out on members of the Fire
                Service from whatever section of the community they come. After
                all, they were going out to save lives, which is the most
                important thing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion and call on the House to
                do so. Once again, I remind Members to listen closely to what
                the Fire Brigades Union and other members of the Fire Service
                have told us. A state-awarded medal must come as soon as
                possible.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, Madam Deputy Speaker. I
                also welcome today’s announcement by the Minister of Health,
                Social Services and Public Safety, in which she informed the
                Assembly of the Executive’s decision to grant the Fire
                Authority a corporate award. I also wish to express my thanks to
                the Fire Authority and my gratitude for the sacrifice and
                commitment of individual members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Colleague, John Kelly, was not saying
                anything about firefighters discriminating about where they
                went, or about postcodes when responding to fires or road
                traffic accidents. He was pointing out that discrimination has
                been recorded in the employment of Catholics in the Fire
                Authority. The motion tabled by Jim Shannon and William Hay
                shows us exactly where the DUP is coming from. It is clearly
                about marking out Unionist territory. The idea of a proposed
                state award to the Fire Service is about rewarding one section
                of the community more than another, and we cannot allow that to
                happen. The motion shows the DUP in its true-blue colours of
                non-inclusiveness again. The DUP showed it in the Assembly last
                week when it talked about victims. It assumed that some victims
                are better than others, that some families’ suffering is
                better than others. Victims of state violence are of no
                importance to them. We are on the road to equality, whether the
                DUP likes it or not.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must have equal recognition for all in the
                Fire Authority, and the announcement of a corporate award today
                will achieve that. A local award will be acceptable to all, not
                just one section of the community. Mr Shannon said that the Fire
                Service is made up of men and women — sadly, a small
                percentage of women, which is another argument for another day
                — from both sides of the community, and I am glad that he
                recognises that. However, he must recognise that a section of
                the Fire Service will resent the proposal of a state award. That
                cannot be good for staff morale. We have heard throughout the
                debate about funding and staffing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A state award, as proposed by the DUP, is
                about wanting to recognise only the Unionist tradition. There
                are Nationalists in it too. Any award should take account of all
                traditions. Mrs Bell and Mr Ervine said that there were people
                of no religion, and an award should take account of that. An
                award should be acceptable to all sections of the community. An
                award that reflects the ethos of one community cannot, and will
                not, be inclusive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nobody will dispute the service that the Fire
                Authority has given to society, but I want to point out that a
                state award is a British award and will not be acceptable to
                Nationalists in the Fire Service. The Good Friday Agreement says</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;All participants acknowledge the
                sensitivity of the use of symbols and emblems for public
                purposes, and the need in particular in creating the new
                institutions to ensure that such symbols and emblems are used in
                a manner which promotes mutual respect rather than
                division.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The DUP’s motion does not take that on
                board. Where is the sensitivity in the motion? Coming from a
                party that has worked against the agreement, the Executive and
                the notion — God forbid — of equality for Nationalists, it
                is of no surprise to me. The DUP and others in the Assembly need
                to face up to the fact that the Nationalist community is off its
                knees, and it is not going back. It will achieve equality.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A state award will discourage Nationalists
                from joining the Fire Service, but that may suit the movers of
                the motion. My party will not support the motion, but we will
                support the amendment put forward by Mr O’Connor. Unlike the
                DUP, we support equality for all in the community. Go raibh
                maith agat.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Carrick:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The degree of rancour that has been
                introduced into the debate is regrettable. As I read the motion,
                I have some difficulty finding the party political agenda
                referred to by Sinn Féin/IRA and the Member from the Alliance
                Party.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There can be no equivocation, no doubt and no
                prevarication. The amendment proposed by Mr O’Connor smacks of
                an intermediate step. The vast majority of people in Northern
                Ireland have no difficulty in accepting the valour, bravery,
                courage, dedication and sacrifice of the Northern Ireland Fire
                Service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We do not need an intermediate step; we want
                to go for the full thing, which is the purpose of the motion.
                Even to the most casual, impartial observer, it must be obvious
                that members of the Northern Ireland Fire Service have played an
                invaluable, vital and distinctive role in society. Their
                extraordinary and special role over the past 30 years of
                terrorist bombings and mayhem has demanded the highest degree of
                bravery and heroism. Risking life and limb, firefighters never
                shirked from their duty, even in the most horrific circumstances
                or even when they were under physical attack from onlooking
                hate-mongers who associated themselves with sectarian terrorist
                crimes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That commitment and dedication is further
                emphasised when one takes into account the fact that many
                firefighters are part-time, retained firefighters. They did not
                enjoy the same advantages and support that the RUC and the
                Ambulance Service did when responding to emergency calls. In
                response to calls, part-time firefighters had to leave their
                home or place of work and negotiate their way through traffic to
                the fire station, without the help of distinctive sirens or
                signs fitted to their vehicle. Those retained firefighters
                suffered much stress, as did their families, who did not know
                whether they would return home uninjured or return home at all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Despite a campaign by families of retained
                firefighters, that handicap for part-time members of the Fire
                Service has yet to be dealt with. I call upon the chief fire
                officer to adequately and speedily address the issue in
                consultation with retained firefighters. In view of the danger
                that such men encountered and their courage in the face of
                adversity, it is scandalous to deny a state award in recognition
                of the sterling sacrificial service rendered by Fire Service
                personnel in what was in many cases a hostile environment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many of our firefighters have served
                throughout the entire period of civil unrest. We owe those brave
                officers a great debt of gratitude. They bear physical and
                psychological scars, testimony to the horrific and traumatic
                circumstances in which they had to carry out their duties on
                behalf of all of us. We are all aware from experiences in our
                constituencies of many acts of heroism, bravery and sacrifice.
                It is only fitting, therefore, that the brave firefighters, and
                their families, be properly recognised with a state award and
                nothing less than a state award. Anything less for the Fire
                Service personnel in Northern Ireland would be a calculated snub
                for the gallant and brave members of that meritorious emergency
                service.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am rather disheartened by some of the words
                used in the debate. I was surprised that the Executive, and
                indeed the Minister, who is responsible for emergency services,
                should think of making a distinction between the level of
                bravery and the level of award.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is so different about an Indian surgeon
                in Omagh receiving an OBE — a state award? Have the Minister
                and the Executive caved in to the idea that there should be
                various levels of reward for bravery? The Minister needs to
                rethink her position on that subject. She is responsible for
                this emergency service, so how could she suggest that Fire
                Service personnel, who have given great service to every member
                of the community, are not as brave as those in other emergency
                services?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was a devout Roman Catholic who saved my
                brother’s premises when they were petrol bombed. It was an
                equally hard-working and respected Roman Catholic who saved my
                own premises when my car was set on fire at two o’clock in the
                morning. I cannot understand the claims of bigotry and
                sectarianism from the Sinn&nbsp;Féin Benches. However, I see
                the duplicity that they have demonstrated over the past few
                days. It is perfectly all right for Nationalists and Republicans
                to use the state when they are seeking a judicial review in the
                High Court if they think that the state will cave in, but when
                it comes to recognising a state award, the evasion, the
                equivocation and the hiding begins. That has been demonstrated
                here today, initiated by Mr J Kelly and continued by Ms Ramsey
                and others. Indeed, it has been a desperate indication that it
                is not equality that they recognise, but inequality. They are
                almost saying to the rest of the community that if something is
                not Catholic, it should not exist — and that is horrifying.
                The equality laws will be put to good use in my community. I
                will take every opportunity to make sure that the coalition of
                greed that has often denied the Protestant community is
                rectified. I want to make that point clear.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other emergency services have had their
                reward, and those have been mentioned. Why should the bravery of
                someone who releases a young 20-year-old from the wreck of a car
                on the A5 Ballygawley-Omagh road and staunches the flow of blood
                from a severed artery not have equal recognition with the
                surgeon who tenderly sews up that person’s wounds and restores
                him to health? One can be given a state award. Doctors and
                nurses have received those awards, and our police and the prison
                service will receive them. Why not apply equality fully and
                ensure that our gallant Fire Service personnel also receive
                equality of recognition through a state award?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is almost sinful to think that a Minister
                in charge of the Fire Service — a service that all of us
                depend on for life, limb and home — is even thinking along the
                lines that I have heard this afternoon.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also surprised that someone in the SDLP
                whom I respect — Mr Danny O’Connor — should have succumbed
                to Sinn&nbsp;Féin’s duplicity. Some people talked about there
                being no guns inside the door, outside the door or under the
                table but quickly forgot their words. When I respect someone, I
                do not expect him to depart from known and accepted standards. I
                did not expect that from those who can make the distinction, but
                I expect it from those who find it difficult to tell the truth
                at any time. It was almost foreseeable that Sinn Féin would not
                recognise a state award. Over the weekend, they were quite
                prepared to use the state for other legal activities.</p>

                professionalism.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr Shannon and Mr Hay for proposing a
                state award. There should be equality for all, and no
                distinction in what constitutes an act of bravery. Let us be
                fair to the Fire Service.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Davis:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to pay tribute to the Fire Brigades
                Union. Throughout the debate, it has kept Members fully informed
                of what is taking place. I am disappointed that there have been
                sentiments expressed today that have not helped that debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the matter was first raised, I remember
                asking the Minister about a friend of mine from Longstone Street
                in Lisburn who was killed during the troubles. He was blown up
                on the Stewartstown Road. The debate has moved on from that.
                However, when the matter was originally raised with the previous
                direct rule Minister, Lord Dubs, the answer given was as
                follows:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Minister is emphatic that there
                will be no state awards to Northern Ireland bodies&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have moved on a bit — albeit slowly —
                from Lord Dubs’s day. He was emphatic that there would be no
                state award, but we are at long last moving in the right
                direction. Although one can have sympathy with the motion and
                the amendment, I personally believe that the amendment gives
                both. Therefore I do not see any difficulty in our supporting
                the amendment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A fortnight ago, Alliance Party Members
                withdrew their motion because, as I understand it, they wanted
                to talk to the Minister. Eventually, the matter was brought to
                the Executive where it was discussed last week. Arising out of
                that discussion, we had the Minister’s statement this morning.
                It said</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Executive also agreed that the
                Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister should
                investigate whether a State Award would also be achievable or
                appropriate.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am prepared to run with that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been talk today about the Fire
                Brigades Union. It has spoken with me, and I have taken guidance
                from it, as have other Members. Therefore, on the advice that I
                have been given, and because I believe we can achieve it all, I
                support the amendment.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Kane:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I feel privileged to register my support for
                the motion. The unconditional discharge of duties by the
                Northern Ireland Fire Brigade is beyond dispute. In the
                protection of people and property and during periods of extreme
                civil unrest when bombings and violence seemed to reach new
                heights, the officers of the Northern Ireland Fire Brigade were
                there.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A debt of gratitude is felt not only by
                civilians but also by the business community, which stood to
                lose so much as bombers targeted the commercial hearts of towns
                and cities. Without the efforts of the Fire Service, countless
                more properties — on which all communities depended for
                supplies — would have been lost.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The personal risk was and is just as great
                for Fire Service personnel when dealing with emergencies
                unrelated to terrorism. In North Antrim, firefighter Robin Neil
                lost his life when attempting to rescue an individual from a
                farmyard well. He, along with two others, was heroically taken
                by officer Charles McAuley from the well where they had been
                asphyxiated. The three men did not survive, but are we to ignore
                the heroism of the firefighter who lost his life and the officer
                who risked all to save lives?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is the level of risk under which the
                personnel of the Fire Service work. It is the level of risk and
                the willingness to take risks that the motion asks us to
                acknowledge. If we are to demonstrate our coming of age as a
                society, we must commend the work of those who made sacrifices
                and took risks to secure our safety, often at the cost of their
                own life. That sacrifice was made by, and on behalf of, both
                sections of our community.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr Shannon and Mr Hay for bringing
                the issue to the House, and Mr O’Connor for his amendment. The
                amendment is timely, considering the Executive’s decision at
                last Thursday’s meeting, on which I reported to Members this
                morning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased to have been able to attend the
                debate, and I have listened with interest. I support the
                sentiments expressed by members of all parties about the
                courage, dedication and commitment of the Fire Service. We also
                heard about the difficulties facing firefighters in their work
                — some specific examples were given — and the exceptional
                service given by firefighters and their support staff over the
                past 30 years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I said this morning, the Executive have
                agreed that the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy
                First Minister should investigate whether a state award is
                achievable or appropriate. The Executive decided that
                consideration should be given to what form the state award might
                take. The Executive will reconsider the matter when that work is
                completed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reference was made to the British
                Administration prior to the establishment of the Executive. Lord
                Dubs made his position clear on the subject in a radio interview
                on 6 October. Points were also made about value for money,
                comparisons with other services, pay and conditions and other
                practical measures concerned with the Fire Service. The Fire
                Service compares well with other services, as has been confirmed
                recently by the fire inspector’s report. People need to
                realise that pay and conditions of service are not negotiated
                locally. They are agreed by the joint council, which is made up
                of employers and Fire Brigades Union representatives. The Fire
                Brigade is also making every effort on the recruitment,
                retention and the career progression of women.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some people suggested that the Fire Brigades
                Union would only accept a state award, but that was not the
                position presented to me at its October meeting. I was careful
                to listen and record the alternatives that it proposed. An OBE
                is awarded to an individual. Therefore comparisons between
                individual surgeons and what is being suggested in my statement,
                or in the amendment, would be unfair.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This morning, I made a statement that the
                Executive had reconsidered a previous decision on the form that
                recognition of outstanding service should take. I reiterate that
                the performance has been outstanding. The Executive agreed that
                a corporate award by the Assembly would be more appropriate.
                They also agreed that the Office of the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister should investigate whether a state award
                for the Fire Service would be achievable or appropriate, and
                they will consider that again at a later date.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr O’Connor:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members have said that the amendment in
                some way precludes a further award. It does not. The decision
                taken by the Executive last week was that the dedication and
                courage of our firefighters should be acknowledged.
                Mrs&nbsp;Bell rightly said that the Assembly has never made an
                award to anybody, so for the Fire Service to be the recipient of
                an inaugural award would make it even more prestigious. I
                deliberately tried to stay clear of the political points that
                others chose to make, and I tried to be as apolitical as
                possible. I am not trying to cast a slur, as has been suggested,
                on firefighters, or the Fire Brigades Union, by proposing the
                amendment. The amendment allows people to put something in their
                pocket and look for something else.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The award mentioned in the motion is outside
                our gift. It is dependent on the Secretary of State, and he does
                not have to grant our requests. The award stated in the
                amendment is within our gift. It is within the gift of the
                Assembly to create an award that will adequately reward the
                people who have served this country so well over many years and
                in many horrific incidents. Mr&nbsp;Ervine said that the
                amendment and the motion were not exclusive. My amendment does
                not exclude the further possibility of some other type of award.
                However, the motion does not allow the Assembly to make an
                award. We should bear in mind the Minister’s statement that
                the Executive have agreed that the Office of the First Minister
                and the Deputy First Minister should investigate whether a state
                award would be achievable or appropriate.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should bear in mind Mr Davis’s
                reiteration of the statement by Lord Dubs that no state awards
                would be made to Northern Ireland bodies. The important factor
                is to decide whether such a move is achievable or appropriate,
                but such matters should not be aired in public. It is for the
                Minister and the Executive to discuss any such forthcoming
                issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My amendment is an attempt to recognise, in
                an non-divisive way, all those who gave gallant service, without
                discrimination. I recognise the bravery of all those people, and
                we owe them a debt of gratitude. But a debt of gratitude is not
                necessarily enough; we need to create an award that will make
                service members feel that we, as their representatives,
                acknowledge what they have done. We must give them something
                that it is within our power to offer.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the debate, it was difficult to tell
                whether Members were referring to the same amendment and the
                same motion. If Members had listened to Mr Shannon, they would
                know that he did not make any political points in his speech.
                The parties opposite, who lectured us about not bringing
                politics into the issue, did just that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amendment does not go far enough. It
                falls short of an appropriate recognition of the bravery of our
                Fire Service members in Northern Ireland. Members should read
                the Minister’s statement about what she is trying to achieve.
                I remind Members that, a few weeks ago, the Alliance Party
                brought a motion to the House. On the day of debate, it withdrew
                the motion, but it did not give its reason for doing so. It was
                probably an attempt to do some deal with the Minister.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have heard Sinn Féin/IRA go through a
                number of issues today. Nightly, in my constituency, the Fire
                Service is stoned in Republican areas. It is rather sad that we
                have to bring the motion to the House. Had the British
                Government wanted to recognise the service that the firefighters
                have given to Northern Ireland over the years, they could have
                done so. Mr&nbsp;Ervine said that we needed to get the British
                Government on board to recognise properly the job that firemen
                have done. We all know that many areas of the Fire Service have
                been underfunded over the years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is something that needs to be said: we
                have had a terrorist campaign of bombing, burning and shooting
                in the Province for 30 years. Many of the Fire Service personnel
                who were injured in those bombings, burnings and shootings paid
                the supreme price. I do not need lectures from Sinn Féin/IRA on
                how to behave. The Minister seems to forget that the Northern
                Ireland Fire Service has suffered severely over the past 30
                years of violence. We all know that throughout the troubles,
                many of our Fire Service personnel had to retire early because
                of serious injury. In fact, I will go further. Many of them,
                under difficult circumstances, risked their life to save others.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a tragedy that the debate has turned
                the way that it has. Mr Danny O’Connor heard from the union
                representative who contacted him today that there should be a
                state award. I think, Mr O’Connor, that that was made clear to
                you as you spoke to the union representative over the telephone.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Madam Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. The Member should address the Chair.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hay:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There seems to be a problem. I know that the
                Fire Brigades Union met all political parties in Northern
                Ireland, and the message that came across was that the proper
                recognition would be a state medal. That is the message that
                Danny O’Connor, representing the SDLP, got this afternoon from
                a union representative. I would ask Mr O’Connor to state that
                — not now but in the future. It needs to be made clear.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Minister does not have the courage to
                consider a state medal, the matter should be taken out of her
                hands. What is being proposed in the amendment and the statement
                would not be acceptable to the union representatives of the Fire
                Service personnel. I do not believe that the Minister has the
                courage or the strength to take the matter forward in the manner
                that it requires. I ask the Secretary of State to take it out of
                her hands. He should deal with it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have no faith in the First and Deputy First
                Ministers dealing with the matter either. It is wrong for some
                Ulster Unionists to support the amendment, because they know
                that it does not go far enough. They are hoping that the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister will make everything all
                right, but we know that that will not be the case.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members say that we can give an award
                and then possibly look at a state award. The motion asks only
                that we make representations to the Secretary of State for a
                state award. That is all. One would think from listening to some
                of those who spoke on the amendment that we are asking for some
                great task to be undertaken. If we genuinely want to recognise
                the firefighters of Northern Ireland, there is only one way to
                do it, and that is a state award. That is the message from the
                union representatives of the firefighters of Northern Ireland.
                That is the only way in which it can be done.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Minister responsible for the issue
                cannot deal with it, we should get someone else who can — and
                I do not mean the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister.</p>
