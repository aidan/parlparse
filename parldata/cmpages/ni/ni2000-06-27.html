                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That this Assembly notes with concern the
                poor state of the public transport system in Northern Ireland
                and proposes that the Minister for Regional Development should
                urgently implement a comprehensive and integrated public
                transport policy to redress this problem<i>.</p>
                </i></font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a great debate among the public
                about the state of public transport. Over the past week the
                depth of the underfunding crisis in public transport — in
                particular, the railway network — has been brought into sharp
                focus by the media, including the ‘Belfast Telegraph’. The
                severity of the problem has been highlighted, as Members are
                aware, by Translink’s managing director, who has warned in a
                letter to employees of Northern Ireland Railways (NIR) that most
                of the North’s railway network may close down — the
                exception being the Belfast-Dublin Enterprise line — with the
                loss of 700 jobs, because of the gravity of the crisis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This has served to illustrate the gross
                disparity between Government funding of Northern Ireland’s
                public transport system and their funding of Britain’s, which
                is the accumulated result of years of sustained neglect by
                successive Governments, both Labour and Conservative.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Northern Ireland, 30% of households do not
                own cars. The continued fall in the standard of public transport
                provision is an issue which goes to the heart of the core
                principles of social justice and our obligation to create a new
                society rooted in inclusivity, equality of opportunity and
                access as described in the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, the present Labour Government’s
                attitude towards public transport in Northern Ireland is
                particularly disappointing. It is totally at odds with their own
                stated policy and their commitment to ensure that public
                transport becomes a more attractive and accessible option.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government’s White Paper on the future
                of transport, entitled ‘A New Deal for Transport: Better for
                Everyone’ and published in 1998, stated that there was
                consensus for a radical change in transport policy. The Deputy
                Prime Minister and Minster for the Environment, Transport and
                the Regions, John&nbsp;Prescott, said that motorists would not
                be prepared to use public transport unless it was significantly
                better and more reliable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, in the comprehensive spending review
                which followed, no extra resources were provided for public
                transport in Northern Ireland. Public transport is now a
                devolved matter for which the Assembly has responsibility. It is
                the remit of the Department for Regional Development to
                implement for this region a public transport policy which is
                balanced, sustainable and socially inclusive and has clear and
                realistic objectives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department’s draft regional strategic
                framework for Northern Ireland marks an important starting
                point. It acknowledges that a strategic focus is needed for
                future transport development. It correctly recognises that the
                greater travel choice offered by car ownership is not enjoyed by
                all. The lack of a car can contribute to social exclusion and
                reduce access to work opportunities and services, particularly
                for those in rural and disadvantaged urban areas. However, we
                appreciate that there are no easy solutions to this problem. The
                Regional Development Committee has been discussing the issue
                over recent weeks.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Real change in Northern Ireland’s public
                transport system will be achieved only if more money is made
                available and can be allocated within the context of a public
                transport policy which is receptive to other sources of revenue.
                It must also be sustainable and integrated with the public
                transport system on the island as a whole to maximise the most
                efficient use of scarce resources. It is this sort of
                comprehensive and balanced approach to public transport which
                will not only improve the economic regeneration of the region
                but will also — and this is important — protect the
                environment and enhance the quality of life of the population
                generally. We had a better railway system at the start of the
                twentieth century than we have at the start of the twenty-first
                century, because of the number of lines that have been closed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As someone who comes from Omagh, I remember
                when the railway from Derry through Strabane and Omagh to
                Portadown closed in 1964. I contend that that brought serious
                disadvantage to our area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The state of our railway network dramatically
                underlines the extent of the current problem. According to
                several public surveys, customer satisfaction with the quality
                of service still leaves much to be desired. For example, the
                spring independent monitoring update conducted by
                PricewaterhouseCoopers on behalf of Translink revealed a
                decrease in the performance ratings for NIR with respect to
                overall customer satisfaction with both trains and the
                conditions of stations. Trains are now running with fewer
                carriages, and passengers are travelling in overcrowded
                conditions. Although at the moment Translink operates a
                relatively safe railway network, this cannot continue
                indefinitely given the present lack of investment. There is a
                risk to public safety. Recently Translink commissioned a report
                into safety. The reality is that our railways are safe, but only
                because trains move quite slowly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Back in March the British Government
                announced a massive £52 billion investment in Railtrack over
                the next 12&nbsp;years. Similarly, the Government in the
                Republic followed the advice in a report produced for them by
                International Risk Management Devices and acknowledged that
                £500 million was needed to upgrade safety systems on the CIE
                network.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Public subsidies in other EU member states
                are also significantly higher than those in the North of
                Ireland. For example, the level of subsidy in Germany’s rail
                network is more than 10&nbsp;times the amount accorded to NIR.
                There is a glaring gap between the Government’s rhetoric on
                public transport and the reality of the issue. According to
                Translink’s submission to the Northern Ireland Affairs Select
                Committee, Northern Ireland Railways sees only a fraction of the
                financial support given to the privatised companies in Britain.
                For example, in 1997-98 the rail network in Britain was
                subsidised to the level of £33·20 per capita, whereas the
                level in Northern Ireland was £5·50 per capita. Other
                comparisons show further disparities. For example, in 1998 NIR
                received 5·28p per passenger mile, by comparison with Scot
                Rail, which received 22·1p per passenger mile. Railways
                operating in the Cardiff area received 35·8p per passenger
                mile, those in Liverpool 41.5p, and those operating in the Isle
                of Wight 64·5p.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Overall, the public money payable by the
                Government to NIR has declined by 3% in recent years from a low
                base. The impact of this lack of investment upon the rail
                network is far reaching and has serious implications for the
                quality and safety of the service that Translink is able to
                provide. The report commissioned by Arthur D. Little, experts in
                rail safety, which was published in March, contained 121
                recommendations. It concluded that £183 million was needed for
                new passenger rolling stock, trains, repairs to bridges, sea
                defences and new signalling and safety equipment. Almost half of
                the rail network needs to be relaid. The sum of £72 million is
                needed for new trains and six new bridges; other structures are
                needed at a cost of £67 million; and £25·5 million is
                required for the modernisation of signalling equipment, safety
                systems and the upgrading of crossings.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The financial position of NIR is stark.
                Northern Ireland estimates for the year 2000-01 allow only
                £8·27&nbsp;million for capital expenditure. According to
                Translink, it cannot afford to purchase new trains and is
                allowed to spend only £3·4&nbsp;million on the minor
                refurbishment of carriages, which will extend their useful life
                by approximately three years at the most. Taking into
                consideration the withdrawal of trains for repairs — and it is
                Translink’s stated policy to maintain services — this will
                mean running trains with only two or three carriages, instead of
                the normal five, and less frequently. Inevitably, this will
                cause disruption to services and, in the long term, could result
                in the eventual closure of part or the entire rail network,
                except for the Dublin-Belfast line.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The effects of the closure of the railway
                network on Northern Ireland’s overall transport system would
                be enormous. Every year approximately six million passengers use
                the train to get to work. Traffic volumes in Belfast are already
                increasing by 4% per annum. If sufficient investment is not
                forthcoming, thousands of cars will be added to our roads. It is
                estimated that over the next 25 years 70,000 additional cars
                will be on Northern Ireland’s roads if the present trend
                continues. It is estimated that every morning an extra 3,000
                vehicles would be added to the M1, the M2 and the Sydenham
                bypass. Closing the Bangor-Belfast line would add an extra 1,000
                cars onto the roads at peak times.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Closure of the railway network is not a
                viable option. The people of the North of Ireland deserve a
                better deal. The railways task force, which is due to publish
                its interim report in July, can come to no conclusion acceptable
                to the wider community other than to recommend a substantial
                programme of Government investment. This is needed to address
                the public safety requirements and to ensure the survival of the
                network.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although in not quite as severe a crisis as
                that afflicting our railways, Northern Ireland’s bus services
                also suffer considerably from a lack of investment. In recent
                months we have had fare increases of an average of 4·5% —
                almost twice the rate of inflation — and services have been
                cut by 3% or 4%. This increases the sense of isolation,
                particularly in rural areas, among disadvantaged groups, such as
                the disabled, the unemployed, students and the elderly, who may
                not own a car, and causes even more traffic congestion in urban
                areas. Approximately 71% of commuters still opt for a car
                instead of a bus or train.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The crisis in public transport is such that
                we in the Assembly must work with the Department of Regional
                Development and the Executive to face up to the stark reality. I
                hope that when this debate is concluded there will be successful
                negotiations to try to bring about a long-term resolution and to
                develop a strategic framework for public transport in Northern
                Ireland.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr&nbsp;Speaker. Perhaps
                you would confirm that the real nub of this debate — finance
                — cannot be put to the Assembly because of the legislation
                that governs the matter of moneys here.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful to the Member for raising this
                question. It is clear that there is not always a full
                understanding of what matters may be tabled and what matters may
                not. As Members may recall, section&nbsp;63 of the Northern
                Ireland Act 1998, upon which the Assembly is based, makes it
                clear that no sums may be required from the Consolidated Fund
                and that no sums may be appropriated by vote, resolution or any
                other means, except with the approval of the Minister of Finance
                and Personnel. Therefore, in the event of a motion being laid,
                or an amendment to a motion, without the approval of the
                Minister of Finance and Personnel, the Assembly could not vote
                upon it if it would increase a sum that had been appropriated or
                require funds to be brought forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can understand that Members may regard this
                as a restriction when dealing with such a matter, as has been
                said by Mr&nbsp;Byrne. However, it is the legal basis upon which
                we must function. The Member is right to draw it to the
                attention of the House at this time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before we move on, may I draw two or three
                other matters to the attention of the House. All Members will
                have had circulated to them the text of a private notice
                question in the name of Mrs&nbsp;Mary&nbsp;Nelis. Private notice
                questions are taken immediately before the Adjournment debate,
                which under Standing Orders begins at 3&nbsp;o’clock. The only
                way we can square that circle is, in effect, to stop the
                procedural clock at that point to allow that private notice
                question to be taken. It is taken in the usual fashion: the
                question is put, the Minister responds, a supplementary is taken
                from the questioner, and other supplementaries are permitted for
                a time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I mention all this because this is the first
                private notice question we have had, and, of course, it is not
                on the Order Paper. I also want to remind the House that there
                is a statement from the Minister of Health, Social Services and
                Public Safety on the fire service. That will be taken at a
                convenient time, after a number of other debates and before the
                debate on the Equality Commission this evening. The time is
                difficult for me to estimate; it will depend on the rest of the
                discussion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That takes me to the question of timing for
                this debate. At the start it was not possible to indicate
                timings as I did not know how many Members wanted to speak. In
                the course of the proposer’s speech it became clear that the
                number is very substantial. Therefore I have little option but
                to restrict the time available to five minutes for each Member
                who will speak, 10 minutes for the Member who proposed the
                motion to wind up, and 20 minutes for the Minister to respond.
                The Minister will, of course, be given the opportunity to
                respond at the usual point, which is at the end of the debate,
                prior to the winding-up speech.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will have to keep Members to
                five&nbsp;minutes. If more Members come forward they will not
                necessarily be able to speak. I may not even be able to get
                through the list I already have. However, we will do our best.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will know from listening to the radio
                in the morning that traffic is a problem in the Province. All
                will be familiar with Sandyknowes, Tillysburn, the Westlink and
                the M1. Every single morning there are reports of congestion at
                those points.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Traffic conditions are getting worse all the
                time. Car ownership in the Province has increased by 400% since
                1960, and there are currently over 700,000 cars on the road.
                Ninety-eight per cent of goods are moved by road. Those who have
                recently travelled by train will know that most of our trains
                are old, shabby, prone to breakdown and, certainly on the Bangor
                line, extremely crowded. From this one can deduce that transport
                is in crisis, and this has come about as a result of a sustained
                lack of funding over a number of years. When times got tough
                transport was regarded as one area where money could easily be
                saved. We can ask for more money, but, sadly, although there may
                be some relief in the short term, there probably is not much
                more available, so we have to look at other solutions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need a plan, and, indeed, there is a plan.
                A regional strategic framework and an integrated transport
                policy are on the go, and it is to be hoped that they will be
                with us by the end of the year. Of course, there is a price to
                pay, and we and the Minister will, I suspect, have some hard
                choices to make. The regional strategic framework sees a
                settlement network of the hubs of the two cities, Belfast and
                Londonderry, with a series of hubs and clusters — the main
                towns and villages — in a key transport network which will
                link all these areas, allowing people to move from one to the
                other quickly on the key transport corridors and, of course, the
                gateways that lead from the Province, the ports and airports.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the next year there are terms you will
                learn to know and love, because they will govern how most
                Departments will be dealing with regional matters. For example,
                the strategic framework includes planning and housing and social
                development, as well as a number of other areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a need to reduce car usage and
                pollution. Government policy accepts this, as was evidenced in a
                recent report which recommended a 60% reduction in greenhouse
                gases within 20 years. How do we get out of our cars and into
                some other form of transport which is less dangerous in terms of
                pollution? It is very difficult. In rural areas we are, perhaps,
                looking at small buses, a subsidised taxi system or some other
                better way of providing rural transport. What happens to school
                buses during the day when they are not collecting pupils? We are
                paying for them. Could they not be put to better use? In rural
                areas people have to use their cars, but in the Belfast
                travel-to-work urban area it is different.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Here is an opportunity to look seriously at
                some form of public transport. Every day people travel from
                Larne, Antrim, Lisburn and Dromore to work in Belfast, and a
                rail system would be logical; a fast, rapid transport system
                could be provided which would get people to work quickly and in
                comfort, allowing them to leave their cars at the station. This
                happens elsewhere in the United Kingdom and in the Republic, but
                until we introduce a public transport system that people want to
                use, they will not abandon their cars. It is a chicken-and-egg
                situation. The answer is either leasing or some form of
                public/private partnership. That is the way we must go.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr R Hutchinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome this opportunity to speak on the
                steady decline and lack of investment that has become all too
                apparent in the public transport system and the roads network
                throughout Northern Ireland. Roads funding has declined. Real
                public expenditure on transport has fallen at a rate of 14.5%
                over the last five&nbsp;years. Independent analysis has revealed
                an estimated shortfall of £40&nbsp;million per annum in
                structural maintenance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today’s society simply cannot function
                without roads. In the last 10&nbsp;years traffic volume has
                increased by an average 2.8% per annum. This is reflected in
                traffic volumes on many of our roads. This morning I drove the
                A8 Belfast-Larne route, on which traffic varies from over 18,000
                vehicles per day near Corr’s&nbsp;Corner to approximately
                10,500 vehicles per day south of the A757 junction. That does
                not include freight traffic from the ports of Larne and Belfast.
                It is staggering that, by 2005, car ownership in Northern
                Ireland will reach one million. There is a need for an improved
                roads infrastructure and transport system Province-wide.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland has a £13&nbsp;billion
                roads network. That is one of our most valuable assets. Major
                structures such as bridges, which make up 10% of that asset, are
                inadequately funded. The structural maintenance of that network
                is of paramount importance to the economic and social well-being
                of our Province. There is a need to identify, maintain and
                develop our main commercial routes, giving priority to the key
                transport corridors. There is no doubt that substantial
                investment is required in order to promote economic growth and
                to improve road safety by bringing about a reduction of one
                third in the number of fatalities and serious injuries that
                occur on our roads. Higher priority must also be given to the
                needs of pedestrians, cyclists and those using public transport,
                particularly in a climate of spiralling fuel costs and increased
                taxes on car users.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, it makes little sense to encourage
                motorists off the roads and on to an inadequate rail system.
                Lord&nbsp;Dubs, a former Environment Minister, described
                Northern Ireland’s rail system as a complete shambles. Concern
                has grown over declining levels of service across the Province.
                This week’s fact-finding exercise by the railways task force
                will no doubt confirm the public’s lack of confidence in the
                current provision. Miles of track needs to be relaid. Many
                trains are 30&nbsp;years old. It is anticipated that 29 train
                sets are needed to maintain existing services, but by the end of
                next year only 24 will be available, thus resulting in a
                reduction of services and the possibility of line closures.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Talk of the truncation or withdrawal of
                railway lines such as we have had in recent weeks conjures up
                negative images of this important medium of transport and
                reinforces the idea that the public perception of the rail
                system is very negative. A&nbsp;D&nbsp;Little’s safety report
                tells us that the Northern Ireland railway system is just about
                safe. It also says that there is a need for an investment of
                £183&nbsp;million to be phased in —</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. When
                I heard the discussions about this debate on the radio this
                morning I was worried that the issue of whether the DUP is in
                the Executive — and the impact this could have on funding —
                was in danger of obscuring this vital debate on the crisis in
                public transport.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I raised this issue with the Minister of the
                Regional Development Committee at the start of the year. I was
                encouraged to hear that he was initiating a comprehensive
                10-year strategy to tackle the issue of public transport instead
                of the ad hoc approach which has been adopted by direct rule
                Ministers in the past. There is no doubt that there has been
                massive under-investment in public transportation over many
                years. This is in contrast to patterns both in Britain and in
                the South. The draft regional development strategy does not give
                enough consideration to the operating of the railway network, or
                to the provision of bus lanes, bicycle lanes, or park-and-ride
                services. There is an absence of achievable targets for shifting
                transport patterns from cars towards public transport. In the
                urban areas in particular, restrictions on car use would enhance
                the demand for public transport.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The knowledge that car ownership will double
                here in the next 25&nbsp;years should give a sense of urgency to
                this. The free transport system piloted in the Castlereagh and
                Newry and Mourne council areas, and which also exists on the
                North/South line, should be quickly extended to the remainder of
                the Six Counties. Public transport must be easily accessible to
                disabled persons and to parents with small children. Attention
                should be given to the upgrading of rural public transport
                systems in the draft strategy, and any future public transport
                strategy must be integrated on a North/South basis. These
                policies should also take into account the particular
                developmental needs of the west and south of the Six Counties
                — something that appears to be lacking in the regional
                strategic framework.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Cheann Comhairle, the current traffic
                congestion and the anticipated traffic nightmare over the coming
                years dictates that a grooming of the public transport system
                must take place as a matter of urgency. I look forward to an
                imaginative public transport strategy being produced by the
                Minister and to its early implementation. Go raibh maith agat.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome this debate, and I congratulate
                Joe&nbsp;Byrne on putting forward the motion. In his
                introduction he mentioned the needs of rural areas. As somebody
                whose summer holidays used to begin with a trip on the GNR to
                Newtownstewart, I agree entirely with the need for decent public
                transport in rural areas, as found in his constituency.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He also mentioned the needs of deprived
                inner-city areas. He actually left some areas out of the
                equation — areas which are, to some extent, suffering the
                greatest problems of congestion at the moment. I am talking
                about suburban areas like my constituency in South Antrim. It is
                absolutely clear that we will not have a decent system to enable
                people to commute into Belfast from areas like Newtownabbey and
                Antrim unless a decent public transport system is developed.
                There is supposedly a good motorway connecting this constituency
                with Belfast, yet all Members who live in the north or the
                north-west complain about the congestion at Sandyknowes, which
                they experience every morning coming here. These problems have
                been exacerbated by the development of housing in commuter towns
                and in suburban areas without any commensurate increase in the
                public transport infrastructure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have a few suggestions which I would like
                the Minister to consider. He has heard a few other suggestions
                from me and will doubtless hear a few more over the coming
                years. There is a fundamental problem with the way the Treasury
                operates. I know we are not supposed to be talking about that
                this morning, but I will get my cheap jibe in anyway. The fact
                that Translink is handing cash reserves back to the Treasury at
                a time when it cannot buy buses and trains is a scandal. That is
                the only conceivable word for it. It is time that we in the
                Assembly decided whether we have the power to judge those
                decisions. We need to tell the Treasury that we think this is a
                scandal, and we need to do so with a united voice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We clearly need to move much further with
                regard to integration. Combined bus and rail tickets should not
                be too difficult for Translink to introduce. Last week a senior
                officer of the Assembly said to me in Donegall Square that it
                was nice to see a public representative using public transport.
                However, like most of us, I am a bit of a hypocrite because I do
                not use it very often. I discovered last week that to come from
                Templepatrick on a Ballymena express bus and go back to
                Templepatrick on an airbus requires two tickets. One cannot use
                a return ticket on the two different services. It is really time
                that Translink introduced integrated ticketing to include
                railways and all bus services and put an end to this ludicrous
                situation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to stop giving lip service to the
                public transport system and start getting real about the
                problems of private cars. We seem to run frightened of the roads
                lobby, but we need to go out and talk to our constituents. There
                are plenty of houses, I know, within my constituency with two
                cars sitting outside.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The people wish that they did not need both
                the cars — one staying at home during the day for family use,
                and the other being used to get to work in Belfast.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no doubt that until we start to
                provide an element of the stick alongside, and preferably
                slightly behind, the carrot of improved quality of public
                transport, we are not going to deal with that issue. We need
                measures like quality bus corridors, but we also need to tackle
                the issue of congestion charging by parking charges or other
                means. We need to consider some of the ideas that people like
                Transport 2000 have advanced on the issue of out-of-town
                shopping centres and the associated major problems of free
                parking and the destruction of town and city centres.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have one specific suggestion to put to the
                Minister, and I understand that it is entirely within his remit.
                It is time that public transport policy be no longer regarded as
                an adjunct of the Roads Service. It is time for the Roads
                Service to be an agency administering an integrated transport
                policy, or part of an integrated transport policy, for his
                Department. It should not be something in which buses and trains
                are subservient to the car. We need to get the mindset right,
                and Members in the Chamber should start doing something about
                it. If we do not, we will be a little hypocritical in preaching
                at others. We need to set the example.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dallat:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some time ago I visited Berlin. The whole
                road and rail infrastructure was being rebuilt following the
                collapse of Communism in the east. Roads and railways were being
                linked up again to create a modern network, bringing immediate
                economic and social benefits, and protecting the environment
                from the pollution of the past. Above all, the new investment
                was designed to target the social needs of the east, which had
                been so neglected under the communist system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Northern Ireland much has been done since
                the ceasefires. Border roads have reopened, and the new
                Enterprise trains have transformed rail travel between Belfast
                and Dublin, with obvious advantages for the towns in between.
                The City of Derry Airport is slowly but surely building up new
                business which is adding to the value of the north-west as an
                attractive place in which to invest. However, there is a
                downside. Officials from the Department for Regional Development
                are currently touring council chambers showing a set of slides
                to elected members. The slides would be an embarrassment to any
                Government Department. They tell the sad tale of a rail and road
                infrastructure in serious decline and, in some cases, literally
                disappearing. They show rusty old trains, with matching tracks
                and bridges, and roads that are breaking up without the money to
                replace or repair them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Councils are being asked for their views in
                helping to pay for these. Are we back to the tollroads of the
                medieval past, or is someone going to get serious about the
                problems confronting us? Why can Northern Ireland not build up
                its infrastructure that has been so badly neglected under
                30&nbsp;years of direct rule? Why does the Minister for Regional
                Development not have the same vision for the future as the
                people of Berlin? Why is he not sitting down with his fellow
                Ministers in the Executive? Why is he refusing to take part in
                the North/South bodies with his Colleagues from all parties, so
                that, together, we can begin the process of creating a new,
                modern road and rail infrastructure that will give life to our
                economic and social development strategies for the future?
                Instead, he is creating uncertainty by telling us that he will
                resign from his post. Of course, we have now learnt that even if
                he wants to stay the newly appointed &quot;Pope&quot; will sack
                him anyway.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How can this nonsense help the people of
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland, who have a right to expect political
                leaders to rebuild what has been destroyed or neglected? A
                modern transport system is vital to the country’s future. We
                cannot deliver on our promises to target social need, create
                equality or protect the environment if large parts of the North
                are suffering from serious decline. The Belfast to Derry line is
                critical to the success of the North and the north-west. There
                is a strong case for developing fast and modern road transport
                corridors between the west of Ireland and the North. We need to
                do what the people of Berlin did and seriously begin to rebuild
                and develop what has been neglected.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes, there was a time when it was customary
                to boast of the modern roads of the North and to scorn the
                winding, twisty roads of the South. But that is the past.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Republic of Ireland is currently spending
                £2 million per day on roads alone. Most of the money is their
                own; it is not European Union money. They are planning to
                upgrade their railways to the highest European standard, because
                they know that that is the only way to build a modern economy
                — one which addresses social need and delivers prosperity to
                everyone. We can do it too, but we cannot afford the luxury of a
                Minister who is hopping in the corner, or worse still, out in
                the cold. Let us take a leaf out of the book of the Germans or,
                indeed, of the Irish, and get real. We have lived in the world
                of pretence for far too long.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Leslie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the opportunity to address this
                motion. For reasons already pointed out, it is of particular
                interest to myself and anybody living in the North Antrim
                constituency who needs to travel to Belfast. As we look forward
                to the reopening of the Bleach Green line, it would be a great
                shame if the opportunity for a faster rail link to the north and
                north-west — which would appeal to many people — were not
                properly seized because of the poor state of the rest of the
                infrastructure relating to it. However, the possibility of
                greater demand for that service would lead to the prospect of
                extra revenue being generated, which in turn would help ease the
                obvious capital spending problems. Those of us who live north of
                the dual carriageway build line on the A26 are acutely aware of
                the attraction of being able to use the railway as an
                alternative.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I suspect that the Minister, in his response
                to this debate, will be quite tempted to start with the refrain
                &quot;Well, if you have the money, I have the time,&quot;
                because essentially we are looking at a capital spending
                problem. We have to be aware, however, that should more money
                become available for capital spending, there will be immediate
                competition between all the capital spending departments to get
                their hands on it. Therefore the prospects for the transport
                system would be much better if that Minister were present to
                fight his corner in the Executive Committee. For that reason I
                think that it is incumbent upon those Ministers with major
                capital spending programmes to investigate all the avenues of
                private finance to see what can be done to stretch the public
                purse further. The fact that there is a bottleneck of commuters
                coming from the north into Belfast creates an opportunity in
                itself. I believe there is now a sufficient volume of people
                trying to travel in and that there is a commercial opportunity
                to provide an alternative — probably on rails, but possibly by
                bus — that deserves serious investigation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another aspect of the transport issue relates
                to some of the points raised in yesterday’s debate on the
                Industrial Development Board. The Minister, Sir Reg Empey, made
                the point — and it needs to be made again and again — that
                it is not, and should not be, the business of the Government to
                tell business where it should go. Business makes that decision
                for itself. What government can do is to enable people to go to
                where the business, the jobs and the opportunities are, and that
                is a key role of transport policy. Take as an example the world’s
                most successful economy — the United States. Perhaps the
                defining characteristic of that economy is the complete mobility
                of labour. People go to where the work is; they do not expect
                work to be brought to them. We should take the same attitude in
                Northern Ireland. That does not mean that there are not
                opportunities to create work more widely throughout the
                province. I believe that there are. It is a question of being
                able to move the other ingredients that are required in and out
                of those areas. That is the job of transport policy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I wonder whether this Assembly
                should set an example in relation to flexible working hours. In
                other cities where I have worked, that is one of the ways in
                which bottlenecks have been dealt with. There has been a
                willingness, particularly in the service industry, which has the
                scope to do this, to offer people different working days and
                different start and finish times. I have referred to this before
                in debates in the Assembly. The Assembly and its staff
                frequently have to work on Sunday as a consequence of the rather
                optimistic start time on Monday. This causes great difficulties
                for your office, Mr Speaker, and for the Whips’ office. I
                wonder whether the Assembly should not contribute to easing the
                rush hour problems by starting later and finishing later.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hay:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. We were all elected to
                the House a few years ago. Most who came here were councillors,
                and some of us still are. The underfunding of our roads and our
                public transport system is no surprise to councillors. It was
                only when we came here that we realised the seriousness of the
                underfunding. When Roads Service officials came on their annual
                visits to councils we lobbied them for more funding for our
                areas, and rightly so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Roads Service has a budget of £163·3
                million for this year, and that only represents 50% of what is
                needed. That is very serious. We have significant growth in car
                ownership and funding has been decreasing for many years. We
                need to look seriously at the development of our main commercial
                routes and give priority to key transport corridors in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We were told a number of months ago that a
                lot of these projects right across Northern Ireland could only
                be funded by the sale of Belfast port. We should congratulate
                the Minister and his Department. Decisions have not been made on
                Belfast port, but nevertheless work is about to start on some of
                the projects and others are included in the programme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our public transport system is in a serious
                crisis, and the Minister for Regional Development has been
                making the Regional Development Committee aware of the
                seriousness of the situation. He has been to the Committee on a
                number of occasions. Many documents have been drawn up over the
                last number of years on funding public transport. The Little
                report has been mentioned, and it is going to take
                £183&nbsp;million for some of the recommendations in that
                report to be funded. We are now waiting for a report that was
                commissioned by the former Minister, which was a total waste of
                time — we have had enough documents. We know what needs to be
                done, and we can only get a properly funded public transport
                system in Northern Ireland through additional funding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the next months difficult decisions will
                have to be taken on raising additional funds. We will have to
                explore other ways of raising funds, and Members will find that
                to be painful.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I
                wish to speak in favour of the motion. The subjects of roads and
                transport are interlinked with investment, economic development
                services, health, hospitals and equality of access for the
                disabled and the aged, and I make a case for the area west of
                the Bann against a mindset that seems to believe that the world
                ends at the M1.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a need to decentralise, rather than
                centralise, jobs and industry to allow an equal spread of
                investment and jobs right across the area. We face an increase
                in population to 1·7&nbsp;million by 2025. We have one of the
                fastest growing regions in Europe and the most youthful
                population in Europe, with an estimated increase of 180,000
                persons by 2025. An additional 100,000 jobs will be required.
                There will also be a corresponding demand for services,
                infrastructure, jobs, housing and hospitals. The number of
                vehicles will rise to over one million by 2025, with an
                accompanying impact on the environment, traffic congestion and
                the quality of life. Traffic in Belfast is rising by 4% year
                after year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the west, the strategy for development is
                relevant to a cross-border area of around two million people.
                Indigenous industries such as agriculture and textiles have been
                eroded. Local jobs are needed to counteract this with
                development hubs at county level. We need investment in
                infrastructure as the car is a necessity in rural areas. There
                is no choice. No other type of transport is available, and it is
                unlikely that there will be any in the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While bids for funding have been made for
                railways, there are no railways in the west. My Colleague
                Pat&nbsp;Doherty has been working to try to develop something of
                this nature via the South. If jobs are not to be located
                locally, can we have the option of the west as a commuter belt?
                Is this what we want: a region in the west that is dormant, and
                another in the east that is overdeveloped? Or do we want a
                society where people have real choice and equality?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fermanagh’s seriously underfunded roads
                budget for both maintenance and major projects — although we
                have had no major projects there for many years — is
                £150,000. This compares with about IR£8 million per year for
                Cavan, which is just across the border. Fermanagh has more miles
                of roads than any other of the six counties. All we are asking
                for is our fair share — that is all that we expect. There are
                cross-border strategic gateways and corridors that could be
                funded collaboratively with the Southern Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, we need to achieve a balance
                of sustainable development through a strategic approach to the
                future. Fundamental to the overall success of a regional
                development strategy is the need to develop a modern integrated
                transport network. It is important that this strategy provide,
                through implementation of ‘Shaping our Future’, a balanced
                spread of development that meets the needs of everyone, east,
                west, urban and rural.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister for Regional Development, Peter
                Robinson, broadly endorsed the strategy published in ‘Shaping
                our Future’, but he needs to ensure that it will be
                implemented equally across all the areas, east and west.
                Although he does not sit in the Executive, I ask him, since it
                is his job, to ask those in the South for any funding he can
                obtain. Councillors are making similar types of bids.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is the direction in which we should be
                going. We should be looking for funding from any source that can
                help us to provide gateways and corridors which access border
                and cross-border areas that are relevant to us all and which
                will make the budget go that much further. Go raibh maith agat.</p>

                talking about minutes, but hours. Worried parents did not know
                where the children were. There were also stories about
                overcrowding and serious delays, sometimes on a daily basis, and
                about the lack of communication with passengers when problems
                arose.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The most important criticism is the serious
                compromise to the standards of safety posed by outdated,
                outmoded rolling stock that has been running longer than 99% of
                the cars on our roads. Is it any wonder that thousands of
                commuters travelling from Bangor to Belfast every day prefer to
                use their cars, rather than public transport? You have only to
                look at the Bangor road at rush hour to see the result — cars
                bumper to bumper, traffic jams and many of those cars containing
                only the driver. There is something wrong with our system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Roads Service is building a cycle lane on
                the Bangor-Belfast road, and I welcome that. However, those
                cyclists will soon be wearing oxygen masks as they travel up and
                down the road.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we talk about the need for better public
                transport I do not need to remind anyone of the dangers that
                traffic congestion poses in terms of road accidents, fatalities
                and the devastating effect that it has on the environment. We
                need a major injection of funding for all public transport
                systems. I am not just referring to the Bangor to Belfast line.
                We need to open up other routes, reinstate old routes and have,
                as has been suggested, integrated transport networks, integrated
                ticketing, innovation, and new ideas coming into this system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The public must be encouraged to use public
                transport. It should be fast, efficient, clean, cheap and
                accessible to all — a simple recipe. The use of European funds
                has been mentioned, but I believe that our public transport
                system should have the support of direct government funding.
                These matters should not be left to Europe alone. It is true
                that, when it comes to public transport, the continental
                Europeans understand people’s needs. I was in Barcelona
                recently and I took a train at 11.30 pm. It was packed with
                young people, and classical music was being piped to them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why do we always have to accept second best?
                We deserve better. This issue undoubtedly unites the Assembly.
                Our Regional Development Minister has the power and the ability
                to do something fast and do something now. Let us go for it.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.30 am</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairman of the Regional Development
                Committee (Mr A Maginness): </b>Undoubtedly, public transport
                has been the Cinderella of Government policy for the past three
                decades. When we look at how public transport has been treated
                — the severe underfunding — and at the result of
                under-investment, in terms of road congestion and severe
                transportation problems, we see a baffling history of neglect on
                the part of Government. We see how short-sighted Governments
                have been in relation to public transportation. Public
                transportation was starved of adequate funding. It was by
                deliberate Government choice. It was not accidental — it
                happened because Governments wanted it to happen. Governments
                emphasised the private motor car at the expense of a proper
                public transportation system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have an opportunity to put right that
                historic wrong, given our new Assembly and Administration. We
                can create a state-of-the-art transportation system — the most
                modern public transportation system in this part of Europe —
                if we put our minds to it and if we get the necessary funding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have heard about the underfunding of our
                transport system. We know that it will take at least
                £183&nbsp;million to bring our railway system up to an adequate
                standard. We need at least another £40&nbsp;million for new
                buses and we need more money on top of that. We have a real
                problem with funding, but it can be done if we bring an
                imaginative approach to the whole problem of transportation.
                That is the task that the Department for Regional Development
                should set itself to, ably assisted by the Regional Development
                Committee, and I hope we can persuade the Administration to
                provide the necessary funding. If we do not do that we will
                create an even worse situation in the future. We need a good
                public transportation system because it is pivotal for economic
                growth in our society. It is not a luxury, an add-on or an
                extra. It is vital to economic growth.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I am disturbed by a number of
                things. First, the European money that has been earmarked for
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland does not seem to include an allocation for
                transportation, whether public or otherwise. I view that matter
                with grave concern. Secondly, the inherent conservatism in the
                Regional Development Department in relation to dealing with the
                problem is also of concern. Thirdly, I regret the fact that,
                under present accountancy rules in the Department of Finance and
                Personnel, moneys are clawed back from Translink — that is
                absolutely and utterly wrong.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need a novel approach to those accountancy
                rules and a more imaginative attitude to the whole question of
                leasing, which is vital to the development of our system. The
                task force has blighted the development of our public transport
                system. I shall end by saying —</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Could the Assembly give the Member leave to

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No, it would not be correct to say that the
                Assembly may give such leave. The decision on time allocation
                was made at the beginning of the debate, and we must stick to
                it.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Davis:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I should like to begin by congratulating the
                Minister on the start that he has made in his Department. As
                previous Members have said, given the lack of Government funding
                over the past few years, it is good to see a home-grown Minister
                in that Department.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I should like to endorse the thrust of the
                motion, particularly its emphasis on the integration of
                transport, not only so the left hand knows what the right hand
                is doing but to anchor transport within a holistic approach to
                regional development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A transport debate may not set the Assembly
                alight in the way that other issues can, but it is an essential
                element in realising the goal of a more prosperous Northern
                Ireland that pays ever more attention to the preservation of
                natural habitat. Over the past few years, Northern Ireland has
                had to cope with the twin problems of a decline in our
                traditional industries and the effects of terrorist violence on
                economic investment. Diversification will counter the worst
                effects of the former, and we trust that we shall see a
                permanent end to the latter one day soon. However, if our
                inherent disadvantages as a peripheral region of the United
                Kingdom and the European Union are to be minimised, local
                industry’s competitive costs must be maintained. An aim, for
                which the realisation of an efficient transport network is key.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should value the integration that already
                exists between the bus and rail networks under the Translink
                umbrella. I dread mainland privatisation being visited on us
                here. The bus and rail systems must be built up to improve the
                use of public transport, and improvements to the road network
                should not be seen as an alternative to public transport, but as
                complementary to it. In particular, I am conscious of the
                Belfast metropolitan area’s poor performance with
                park-and-ride schemes compared with the performances of cities
                of a similar size elsewhere in the United Kingdom. I hope that
                the Department at least, will look at parking provision at
                railway stations so that an entire journey need not be made by
                car.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like other Members, I have priorities for
                transport spending, and I realise that there is no bottomless
                pit of resources. As we all know, in my area of Lisburn we have
                been very supportive of alternative funding mechanisms to pay
                for necessary improvements. We can no longer expect the public
                purse to provide all the improvements we wish to see. Companies
                in Northern Ireland must provide cheap, quick access for
                business to ports and airports to facilitate the import and
                export of goods and raw materials, particularly from east to
                west. The easiest access to ports and airports is also essential
                if we are to enhance Northern Ireland further as a tourist
                destination.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In particular, we should be paying more
                attention to the role of our ports and airports in addressing
                the economic, transport and environmental needs of the Province.
                To make the best use of them we need to see more integration
                between travellers and public transport systems. For instance,
                although the main airport at Aldergrove is well situated in
                terms of the economic hub of Northern Ireland, it is poorly
                served by public transport. Equally, roads and rail links to our
                main ports are in need of further improvement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sure we would all encourage the wider
                use of the public transport network. However, I am glad that
                there is at last a growing realisation in Government circles
                that the needs of rural and urban areas are different. I am
                convinced that through increased integration and more use of
                private finance, Northern Ireland can maintain its economic
                progress and meet the needs of its rapidly growing population.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion, and I trust that the
                Department will pay full attention to the views expressed by the
                Members here today.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Carrick:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The subject matter of the motion has been
                much reviewed. There have been at least five reports since 1995.
                We have had ‘Transportation in Northern Ireland: The Way
                Forward’, which was followed by ‘Developing an Integrated
                Transport Policy’ in 1997. In 1998 we had ‘Moving Forward’,
                a Northern Ireland transport policy statement, ‘A New Deal for
                Transport: Better for Everyone’, and then ‘Shaping our
                Future’, which also refers to transport issues. There have
                been many fine words and, of course, many laudable objectives,
                and the problems have been well and truly identified.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nevertheless, public transport in Northern
                Ireland is still in a state of crisis, and as the motion before
                us says, it is in a poor state, no matter how you look at it.
                The infrastructure is poor, existing roads need upgrading and
                trunk road links are required. There are 210 miles of track that
                need to be upgraded — the system is now reduced to five lines.
                There are 58 railway stations and halts that need to be
                upgraded, and additional premises are required. I welcome the
                investment in the A1 outside Banbridge. I thank the Minister for
                that but remind him that a railway halt is required at Craigavon,
                and station improvements are needed at Portadown and Lurgan.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Not only is there poor infrastructure; there
                is also poor equipment. Due to chronic under-investment the
                railway system is literally falling apart. One only has to look
                at Northern Ireland Railways’ background information to the
                railways task force to have that confirmed. The position is
                dire. Safety is at risk, and it is imperative that we do
                something and do it soon.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As well as poor infrastructure and poor
                equipment, there is also poor service. I have complained about
                unreliability — trains arriving late and not being able to
                make the connections — and dilapidated furnishings. Some of
                the trains are dirty, and there are timetabling problems. All
                these issues have to be addressed. Of course, people in rural
                areas do not have these problems because there are no trains
                running in some of those areas. The people there are
                disadvantaged.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There have been five important transport
                publications by the Government, and there is another one in the
                making. All have identified the need and concluded that further
                substantial investment is required. For instance, the 1998
                document ‘Moving Forward’ noted that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;substantial further investment will be
                needed in the strategic roadwork in the first quarter of the
                next century.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are now in the next century and still we
                need to get the funding in place. The underlying thrust of the
                motion is that additional funding is required. Doing nothing is
                not an option; we must move from policy into reality. An
                integrated, sustainable transport strategy will only succeed
                when viable, efficient, alternative modes of public transport
                are available, and this will only come about with substantial
                investment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are, of course, a number of other
                contributory factors which, if implemented, will assist in the
                delivery of an integrated sustainable transport system.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.45 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A fundamental part of the strategy should be
                to reduce the need to travel by planning developments closer to
                services and amenities, by using brown-field sites and by
                encouraging a willingness among employers to accept, and indeed
                promote, flexible working arrangements, including working from
                home.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The key to improving public transport systems
                is the funding issue. The 1998 ‘Moving Forward’ document
                refers to better buses and services, better railways, better
                transport for tourism, better movement of goods, better taxis
                and better access to transport by air and sea. This cannot
                happen without substantial investment. We have thought about
                this, written about it and spoken about it — it is now time to
                act.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Chomhairle. In
                addressing this issue, it is clear from the comments made today
                that there is considerable common ground between all of the
                parties on each side of the Chamber. We are clear on the
                problems that we must address. We are of the view that we are
                adequately served, at present, by the continuing development and
                expansion of our seaports and the international and regional
                airport system. It is when we come to the question of the road
                infrastructure and the rail systems that we can see the
                consequences of years of neglect and underfunding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister for Regional Development has
                recently commented that the transportation system is simply
                unacceptable. Whether or not this is the first occasion, I want
                to state publicly my agreement with that view. The
                infrastructural deficiencies are strangling our economic
                potential, and that has been commonly reflected in all of the
                contributions this morning. We are all only too aware of the
                significant capital funding and revenue issues that arise while
                we are discussing adequate responses to this. The Minister has a
                genuine difficulty in formulating an effective response within
                the spending limitations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problems in our public transport systems
                are longstanding. In my view, they emerge from the old Stormont
                regime. There was an inadequate pattern of regional development
                policy at that time. That is clear when we consider the history
                of the development of the motorways. However, that is in the
                past. Consistent underfunding and under-resourcing during the
                subsequent period of direct rule has exacerbated these problems.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If all parties indicate a common assessment
                of the problems, and given the effective capping of capital
                investment by the British Treasury, then new thinking is
                required. I urge the Minister, as my Colleague did, to
                acknowledge the unacceptable nature of the public transport
                system. He should be prepared to engage in some lateral and
                innovative thinking. I urge him to take an early opportunity to
                meet with his counterpart in the Irish Government, to discuss a
                partnership approach and a strategic development plan for a
                public transport system for the entire island which would serve
                the interests, economic and social, of us all. Such a creative
                and innovative approach would provide unique and effective
                leverage to access the European Union funding that has been set
                aside for this specific policy area. I urge the Minister to
                consider that. That is not meant to be provocative. It is meant
                to be a reasonable, legitimate and constructive suggestion about
                how we can resolve this problem, which, we all agree, is
                strangling our potential for growth. Go raibh míle maith agat.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr B Hutchinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many points have been covered today, and I do
                not want to reiterate them. I do, however, want to lend my
                support to some of them, particularly those that Mr&nbsp;Ford
                made. There is no question that we need an integrated transport
                policy; the question is how long we have to integrate it so that
                we can meet the objectives and have them written into Assembly
                policy. We need to focus on a ten-year period for achieving
                this, but we could make a start, and quite quickly too, as
                David&nbsp;Ford said, with ticketing. Mr&nbsp;Ford came up with
                the good example of the Ballymena express at Templepatrick, but
                this is not just about buses. We should also be able to get a
                ticket that can be used on buses and trains. If those were
                dovetailed, it would be quite good.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Little report talked about needing
                investment of £183&nbsp;million. What shocked me about that
                £183&nbsp;million is that it was for safety measures alone. To
                improve the railway system overall, we need £300&nbsp;million,
                not just £183&nbsp;million. That is a point we need to look at.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I talked to a colleague of mine from
                Coleraine who travels by car and by train. He tells me that if
                one travels from Coleraine to Belfast, it takes two hours or
                more on the train. The same journey can be done by car in one
                hour and twenty minutes. I do not know whether that involves
                breaking the speed limit or not, but at least it is in the
                comfort of one’s car. He also tells me that the train is cold,
                damp, unattractive and uncomfortable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We continually talk about wanting to get
                people out of cars, but how can we do that? We need to have
                attractive alternatives. I suggest that we need adequately
                funded public transport. We need priority bus lanes and
                dovetailing timetables so that public transport can work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In south Belfast a few weeks ago, Translink
                decided to introduce new bus stops and a new timetable. The new
                timetable showed the new bus stops, but the old ticket prices.
                People got irritated when they found out that they were going to
                have to pay another 20% per ticket. Also some of the timetables
                were old ones, so people were at the wrong places at the wrong
                times. These are just some examples of the problems. There are
                things that we can do at the very beginning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also need to do something about our
                airports. It has been said that our airports are strategically
                placed in economic terms, particularly Aldergrove. However, to
                get from Aldergrove to the city of Londonderry, I understand, is
                difficult. If one wants to get to Belfast, one can go by the
                airbus, which is quick. The Minister needs to talk to the
                management of the airports to find out if they are prepared to
                pay some of the costs. I think that they would be interested in
                looking at the costs and at putting some of their money into a
                rail link. We could have rail links with, for example,
                Londonderry airport and also the airport at Belfast harbour. We
                need to pursue those sort of things that would not just help
                businessmen, or the people who live in Northern Ireland, they
                would also encourage tourists — many tourists find it hard to
                get around the Province.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is an interesting debate, and I thank Mr
                Byrne for bringing it forward. Some Members seem to want to use
                this debate as a &quot;whinger’s charter&quot;. I refer in
                particular to Mr&nbsp;Dallat’s very poor and inept
                contribution. He seeks to blame the Minister for the problems
                that the railways and roads have had over the years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We might as well blame Minister&nbsp;Rodgers
                for the BSE crisis, Minister&nbsp;Farren for the tuition fees,
                and Minister Durkan for the lack of money from the British
                Exchequer. I do not intend to go down the same silly line as
                Mr&nbsp;Dallat. It is time that he got real, grew up and moved
                away from council-chamber politics. He should realise that he is
                now in a place where he can make decisions, not just whinge and
                moan about what is going on.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to back up what we are saying today.
                We can tell our local newspapers that we spoke in support of
                public transport, but did we? Do we support public transport?
                Are we prepared to put it on the record that we will not take
                the money that John&nbsp;Prescott will allocate to Northern
                Ireland for its railways and distribute it to health, education,
                agriculture or some other budget? Are we prepared to earmark
                that money for the sole purpose for which it was intended, or
                are we prepared to let it be diverted to other areas? Do we make
                a statement today but not back it up? I believe we would be
                failing in our duty if we were to do that. It is evident that
                public transport needs massive investment — £2&nbsp;billion
                over the next 10&nbsp;years for the railways alone — and one
                would then have to look at the bus service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have a lot of space in Northern Ireland
                for the development of our roads and public transport. We cannot
                do without the roads network. Another £200&nbsp;million a year
                is needed to maintain our roads in their current condition —
                never mind carry out major improvements. Are we prepared to pay
                for this? Are we prepared to do what is required, or are we
                going to sit back and blame the Minister? There is a saying in
                our part of the world that you cannot whistle without an upper
                lip. The Minister needs the money if he is to deliver a good
                rail network and a good bus service, not only for taking
                children to and from school, but one which will be used by
                people travelling back and forward to work. If you want decent
                roads throughout the Province, the Minister needs the money to
                implement this. <i>[Interruption]</i> He definitely can whistle.
                I welcome the commitment to major safety improvements and the
                undertaking that the railways will not operate unless they are
                safe. Safety issues are important and the general public may
                feel that our railways are unsafe. They are not what they should
                be, and we need to look at safety management, safety culture,
                operations, structures, the permanent way, signalling and
                telecoms, level crossings and engineering. All these matters
                need to be dealt with and improved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to find out how much terrorism
                has cost the railway service over the years. I vividly recall,
                morning after morning, switching on the radio to hear that the
                Belfast to Dublin line was not running that day because either a
                device had been planted at Killeen or the trains had been
                attacked at Lurgan. Various attacks have been carried out over
                the years, and I would like to know how much it has cost to
                replace all the buses that were burned out during riots in
                Belfast and other places.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would also like to know if this task force
                serves a useful purpose. My Colleague indicated that there have
                been five reports over the last five years — it is not reports
                we need, it is action. Does the task force serve a useful
                purpose, or did the previous Minister for Regional Development
                introduce it as an excuse not to make the decisions that needed
                to be made?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to support the motion, but we need
                more than that: we need the money to back it up.</p>

                (Mr&nbsp;P&nbsp;Robinson): </b>Many points have been raised
                during the debate. If I cannot touch on all of them in the
                course of my response, I shall, of course, do so in writing. I
                welcome this debate and am grateful to Mr Byrne for availing of
                the opportunity to raise this issue and start a debate in our
                community as a whole about this vital issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is common ground among all Members. We
                have inherited a transport system that is in an appalling state.
                I am determined to bring about major improvements in public
                transport and to provide Northern Ireland with the system that
                it needs and deserves. Substantial additional resources will be
                required. Members will play an important role in ensuring that
                public transport receives the necessary share of the Northern
                Ireland cake. I will return to the matter of resources later.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I want to differentiate between
                funding for buses and for trains. Bus transport receives a
                relatively low level of subsidy, whereas rail transport requires
                to be heavily subsidised. This is the case, not just in Northern
                Ireland, but in Great Britain, the Republic of Ireland and
                throughout Europe. My Department gives grants to the bus
                companies to cover fuel duty payments and 50% of the cost of new
                buses. Our aim is that vehicles be replaced as they reach their
                target replacement ages: 12 years for coaches, and 18 years for
                buses.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over a period this would give average fleet
                ages of six and nine years respectively, which would be similar
                to the English average fleet age target of seven and a half
                years. Our problem is that currently we do not have sufficient
                resources to grant-aid bus replacements at the rate needed.
                Consequently, the bus companies have to keep buses in service
                long after they reach their target replacement age. This is
                clearly unsatisfactory in terms of customer comfort and bus
                reliability. In the current year my Department has only £1·7
                million for bus purchase grants, while over £20 million would
                be needed to meet our objective. That gives some idea of the
                shortfall.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Turning to the more intractable problems of
                the railways, I am sure that all Members have known for some
                time that the railways face serious problems. The release of the
                A D Little review of railway safety last March brought home the
                scale and immediacy of these problems. Briefly, the review said
                that while Northern Ireland Railways was currently operating at
                not unreasonable safety risk levels, an estimated £183 million,
                plus or minus 30%, would be needed over the next 10 years to
                maintain safe operation. The review went on to say that most of
                that £183 million — £117 million, to be precise — would be
                needed in the next three years. To put these sums in context for
                Members, last year Northern Ireland Railways — <i>[Interruption]</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last year Northern Ireland Railways received
                grants and subsidies of just under £20 million. Now we are
                looking for £117 million over three years. Obviously, if we are
                to keep the current railway network operating, the Assembly will
                have to allocate substantial extra resources to it. I will come
                to the Member’s point in a minute.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When my predecessor, Mr Adam Ingram, was
                presented with the A D Little report last March, he decided to
                establish the railways task force to identify the costs and
                benefits, both monetary and non-monetary, of a range of options
                for the future of the railway network in Northern Ireland. I
                suspect that Adam Ingram was wearing his finance and personnel
                hat, rather than his regional development hat, when he devised
                those requirements. Be it Adam Ingram or Mark Durkan, the
                Minister of Finance and Personnel would require any Minister to
                make a business case for any proposal they were bringing forward
                that required such substantial finance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The work of the task force includes a
                large-scale public consultation exercise, which is currently
                under way. There have been some complaints about the limited
                period allocated for the consultation exercise, but Members
                should realise that the task force must complete its work in
                time for its conclusions to be considered in this year’s
                spending review.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The stark reality is that if we do not
                succeed in obtaining more resources for the railways in the
                spending review, then a large proportion of the railway network
                will close down in a piecemeal fashion. Northern Ireland
                Railways has repeatedly said that it will not run trains unless
                it is satisfied that it is safe to do so. It has my full support
                on that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unless more resources are allocated to
                improve the infrastructure of the railways, it will become
                unsafe to run trains on many lines. Unless Northern Ireland
                Railways can purchase new trains, the level of service will
                deteriorate as old trains repeatedly break down and are taken
                out of service permanently. The motion calls for a comprehensive
                integrated public transport policy to be implemented. I am in
                complete agreement with this sentiment, and I will explain the
                steps I am taking to deliver such a policy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The preparation of the regional development
                strategy is nearing completion. It has become clear that the
                provision of a modern, sustainable, integrated transport system
                which will facilitate the rapid, efficient, predictable and safe
                movement of people and goods is a key factor in the successful
                implementation of the strategy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Within the Department for Regional
                Development I have established a dedicated regional
                transportation division which is tasked to formulate a 10-year
                regional transportation strategy. I agree with Mr&nbsp;B
                Hutchinson’s remarks. It is essential that we do this on a
                10-year basis, which gives us the opportunity to implement
                decisions taken by the Assembly. The transportation strategy
                will set out a bold vision for transport, including the expected
                outcomes and the necessary steps required to achieve these. The
                strategy will serve as a daughter document to the regional
                development strategy. Subject to the ultimate approval of the
                Assembly&nbsp;— and necessary resources — it will have the
                potential to transform transport in the region, to get the
                public back on public transport and to provide a modern
                integrated transportation system that will strive to rival the
                best in other comparable regions of Europe.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have alerted the Regional Development
                Committee to the fact that a sum in the region of
                £2&nbsp;billion over the next 10&nbsp;years — additional to
                the wholly inadequate current budget of just over
                £200&nbsp;million per annum — will be required to transform
                transportation in the region. This is in the context of a
                comprehensive presentation which I gave to the Committee on
                14&nbsp;June. My Department will happily provide copies of this
                to Members on request, particularly to those who are seriously
                interested in tackling these important issues. I have allocated
                significant departmental resources to service the railways task
                force established by Adam Ingram. Some 21&nbsp;sub-committees
                are working on the completion of an interim report, which I will
                receive at the end of July.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the future of railways let me
                be very clear. I have a presumption towards rail. It is an
                important strategic regional asset, but I will not compromise on
                the safety of the travelling public and Northern Ireland
                Railways employees. Either the Assembly will decide to have a
                modern and positively subsidised rail service that we can all be
                proud of, or we will, de facto, end up dramatically curtailing
                that network. The days of indecision are over. The
                A&nbsp;D&nbsp;Little review simply confirmed what we have known
                for years. It is time to put up or close up. For our part we
                will ensure that the Assembly has the earliest opportunity in
                the autumn to consider the importance of the railways task force
                interim report. I trust that the remarks made in support of rail
                in the House today will, by that time, have been translated into
                practical action.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will respond to some of the comments made
                during the debate. Mr&nbsp;Byrne, happily, set the scene so well
                in moving the motion that he has enabled me to leave out many
                elements of the transport issue as he had already covered them.
                He made a strong case. He outlined a history of neglect which
                many Members have agreed with. Under both Labour and
                Conservative Governments, the money that should have been going
                into our public transportation system has gone elsewhere. Now we
                face the consequences of 30&nbsp;years of neglect of the system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I acknowledge the important role that the
                Assembly Committee responsible for the scrutiny of the
                Department for Regional Development has played in regard to this
                issue. I trust that it will continue to do so as we deal in
                detail with transportation policy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member referred to the possibility of an
                additional 70,000&nbsp;vehicles being on our roads over the next
                25&nbsp;years. It is going to be something like 10 times that.
                It will be about 700,000. In the next 20&nbsp;years we expect
                the number of vehicles on our roads to double. If people
                consider that there is congestion now, then let them imagine, as
                the Member for North&nbsp;Down did, what congestion will be like
                in the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McFarland referred to the congestion
                problems that presently exist. He also wisely related the issue
                of transport to the regional strategic framework. He pointed out
                the conundrum that we all face in wanting to get people out of
                their cars and onto public transport, but that they are not
                going to get onto public transport until we provide them with a
                comfortable, regular and dependable service. That requires
                funding. The Member for East Antrim, Mr Roger Hutchinson,
                brought us back to road issues. He was right to do that, because
                the majority of our public transport users use buses and the
                road system and that, therefore, is a key and vital issue. It is
                an issue that must figure prominently when it comes to the
                necessity for funding. He mentioned one of my predecessors, Lord
                Dubs, referring to the shambles. I do not think that a much more
                appropriate word could be found for what exists, although I can
                imagine the effect that it had in the Department when he used
                the term.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the railways, the Member for
                East Antrim was right to say that the trains are 30&nbsp;years
                old, that in many cases the lines need to be relaid, and that if
                this did not happen, a reduction in services would result.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the debate. I also welcome the
                £15&nbsp;million for the A5 road. The SDLP and its cohorts in
                Sinn Féin grudgingly did not acknowledge it. They said it was
                only a line on the map. I welcome the provision of the Toome
                bypass. I further welcome the fact that the A5 is to include the
                Strabane bypass, the Newtownstewart bypass and the Omagh
                throughpass, which were all predicted not to happen. Thank
                goodness for a progressive Minister.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad that I gave way. <i>[Laughter]</i>
                I shall be quite happy to give way again if anybody else wants
                to make similar comments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member for South Antrim, Mr Ford, made a
                very useful contribution. I agree with him entirely that, on one
                hand, I am looking for more funds for railways and buses in
                Northern Ireland, and, on the other hand, through the Chancellor’s
                initiative £25&nbsp;million is being clawed away from the
                Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company and Translink. It
                just does not make sense, and clearly that issue needs to be
                addressed. However, I think that the Member will recognise that
                the emphasis of the Chancellor’s package was one of putting
                money into roads. The whole emphasis of what I am doing is on
                telling people that we need to get off the roads and into public
                transport. Mr Ford also gave me a very good cue when he referred
                to quality bus corridors.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the early hours of this morning, while the
                Member was still in his bed, I was travelling by bus along a
                quality bus corridor. I recommend it to all the people on the
                Saintfield Road. The Saintfield Road is the fourth busiest road
                into Belfast, after the two motorways and the Sydenham bypass.
                We had a very smooth run on the most up to date transport in a
                new, quality bus lane. I hope that the public will take
                advantage of this method of getting into Belfast cheaper and
                faster than by car. That is the only way that we are going to
                get people onto public transport.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thought that some of Mr Dallat’s remarks
                dragged the debate down a little, and I will leave them to the
                side. However, I will deal with his comments relating to
                transport and the comparison with the Irish&nbsp;Republic.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Proportionately, I wish I had the resources
                to put into public transport and roads that my counterpart in
                the Irish Republic has. Do not take the colour coding as being
                indicative of anything else, but I am green with envy at the
                funds that are available. It is probably the kiss of death to
                have a Sinn&nbsp;Féin Member saying that he agrees with me
                during the course of the debate and I will probably be
                cross-examined by my party leader afterwards.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Dallat raised a number of issues
                about public expenditure. In the Irish Republic, public spending
                is supplemented by European structural funds, and a substantial
                amount of money comes in from the private sector. If I had had
                more time I would have gone into that issue and how it has
                contributed to our situation in Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards the issue of being in the
                Executive, let me make it clear to Members — and I know they
                like to make party political points — that the neglect that we
                have had for 30&nbsp;years comes as the result of Ministers who
                were in joined-up Government. It did not help them in the past.
                Perhaps we need somebody outside the Government blowing the
                whistle, saying what needs to be done on the railways and not
                being compromised by loyalty to other Colleagues in the
                Executive. Perhaps Members should rejoice in the fact that they
                have a Minister who is not tethered by responsibilities to
                Colleagues in an Executive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of my Colleagues asked a question about
                the cost of terrorism. Apart from the emotional cost to the
                staff and employees of Translink, £300&nbsp;million has been
                lost as the result of the destruction of buses, trains, and bus
                stations. That is without even touching on the issue of the cost
                of disruption and the loss of money that would have come in
                using those services. That money would pay for
                A&nbsp;D&nbsp;Little, and you would have plenty left over to buy
                buses as well. It is an important matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issues involved are complex, and the cost
                implications are considerable. The immediate public transport
                funding problems can only be solved by increasing the public
                expenditure allocation from the Northern Ireland block. In this
                year’s spending review I am seeking an additional
                £250&nbsp;million for public transport, and that will be
                necessary for each of the next three&nbsp;years. Expenditure on
                this level will enable us to start improving public transport
                from its current poor state, and set us on our way to providing
                a public transport service of a standard which the people of
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland desire and deserve.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Within weeks the United Kingdom Government
                will announce the 2000 spending review figures, which will
                likely signal a significant increase in funding for transport.
                There has been press speculation that up to £140&nbsp;billion
                will be made available over the next decade, half of which might
                come from the private sector. It is essential that we advance
                the Northern Ireland transport agenda in tandem with any new
                priority in Great Britain. We must insist that Northern Ireland
                at least receives the Barnett hypothecation. Northern Ireland
                must secure the maximum possible benefit from any such public
                expenditure decisions taken at national level to advance
                transport. On the assumption that the Barnett hypothecation can
                be secured for Northern&nbsp;Ireland, those funds must be
                allocated for the purposes envisaged and not diverted elsewhere.
                This autumn we will begin to rectify the years of
                under-investment in transportation and we will thereby
                reinvigorate our railways, modernise our bus fleet and services,
                and improve our strategic roads network.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After reading the motion, it is clear that
                the proposer has managed to get round the constraints, which you
                referred to earlier, about financial matters. That is because
                the motion contains a commitment to follow a comprehensive and
                integrated public transport policy. The commitment is contained
                in the word &quot;implementing&quot;. The motion does not ask
                for the preparation of a policy because the Member knows we were
                preparing it. It does not indicate anything about an amount of
                money because the Member knows that. It calls for
                implementation, which is the putting in place of financial funds
                to allow the Minister to carry out the task.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Byrne:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to thank everybody who has
                spoken in the debate. I think there is a consensus of support
                for the sentiments of the motion. There is no doubt about it,
                every one of us here and the wider public are extremely
                concerned about the current state of the public-transport
                system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A number of common themes have run through
                the debate, the most important being public safety. Many
                referred to the Little report and the areas of concern it
                flagged up. Translink have stated that on the Bangor to Belfast
                line, trains that should be able to do 70&nbsp;miles an hour
                currently cannot travel at that speed for safety reasons. They
                are currently restricted to doing 50&nbsp;miles an hour, and by
                the end of next year, if there is no new investment in that
                line, that speed will be reduced to 30&nbsp;miles an hour. That
                is the extent of the crisis on one line. Our railway network is
                small — we have railway lines from Derry to Belfast, from
                Belfast to Bangor, from Larne to Belfast and the southern line
                to Dublin — and if it were to be reduced further, it would be
                a joke.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Public transport is currently very much in
                vogue. Members and the public at large are talking more and more
                about the quality-of-life issue; they are talking about the
                environment, and they are talking about traffic congestion.
                Several hundred thousand new cars are going to be adding to this
                congestion over the next 20 years, especially in the Greater
                Belfast area, and so I am glad that this sort of debate is now
                opening up and that we are beginning to focus on the real
                issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As someone who comes from a constituency that
                has no railways whatsoever, I could be asked why I get involved
                in such a debate. I am the regional development spokesperson for
                my party, and there is an onus on all of us to consider the
                problem throughout Northern&nbsp;Ireland and not just in our own
                home patch.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland’s economic potential was
                referred to by a number of Members, and I fully agree that if we
                are going to develop this regional economy, then having an
                adequate, integrated public transport system is essential.
                Inward investors are greatly influenced by communications and by
                transport networks, and those of us who live 75&nbsp;miles from
                Belfast know the handicap of having a poor transport system in
                our part of the region and appreciate how that affects us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A number of Members, including the Minister,
                made reference to the regional development strategy. This is the
                most crucial issue that has been raised in Northern Ireland over
                the last 10&nbsp;years. We are beginning to look at the future.
                ‘Shaping Our Future’ is the phrase that was used on the
                original document. There is an onus on the Department and its
                civil servants to listen to the issues and the concerns of
                elected representatives, be they councillors, Members of this
                Assembly or, indeed, MPs. Reference has been made to this
                dichotomy between bus and rail. Many Members, including
                David&nbsp;Ford, mentioned the fact that there needs to be a
                common ticketing system between rail and bus services —
                something which should certainly be feasible, since Translink
                owns and manages both. I hope that that is something they could
                introduce.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jane&nbsp;Morrice mentioned the problems that
                passengers have on the railways, and I fully endorse her
                comments. Many people have said that timetabling is difficult
                and that there is no co-ordination between bus and rail. Again I
                hope that this is something Translink could improve upon.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However we need to pay tribute to Translink,
                who have been operating for 30&nbsp;years with very little
                public investment. They have been doing a stitch-up job in
                managing to keep a system going despite 30&nbsp;years of the
                troubles, during which buses and trains were bombed. We should,
                therefore, pay tribute to the Translink staff who managed to
                keep a public transport system going through the bad times.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been much discussion about funding,
                and we all recognise that massive public investment will be
                required to address the needs of the public transport system. I
                contend that, in the past, Ministers in charge of Northern
                Ireland’s public transport did not fully reflect the concerns
                and wishes of people who wanted to see greater investment in it.
                We now have a new devolved Assembly, and this is something that
                Members will have to face up to.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Robinson is the Minister with the
                luxury of this job, and no doubt he will be the person who will
                have to lobby strongly for the necessary investment. The
                Regional Development Committee is convinced that we need
                investment in public transport, but we do not have executive
                authority. It is the Executive Committee and the individual
                Ministers that have to make the case and lobby for this funding.
                I hope that that will happen and that the funding will be
                achieved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A number of Members mentioned the many
                reports on transport that have been produced, and I fully accept
                that. Mervyn&nbsp;Carrick said that there have been five reports
                since 1995. One could almost say that we are suffering from
                &quot;reportitis&quot;, since there have been so many. But every
                Member is looking for action.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is remarkable that the only part of the
                railway network that has improved has been the Belfast-Dublin
                railway line — the Enterprise. It has received substantial
                investment over the past 10 years. The moral is very clear: if
                there is adequate investment in the railways and buses, more
                people will use them. With the necessary investment, there is
                the potential for more people to use public transport. People
                need to be encouraged to get out of their cars and use public
                transport, but they will only do that if the alternative meets
                their needs and is attractive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all know — this is especially true of
                those of us who live in rural areas — that the public
                transport system is inadequate. For many years I have commented
                about five bus fleets — education and library board buses —
                that are largely idle. They are only used in the mornings and
                evenings, and it seems to me that this is rather wasteful.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A number of Members, including Mitchel&nbsp;McLaughlin,
                mentioned North/South co-operation. That is one of the benefits
                of real co-operation on an economic and social level. We cannot
                run our public transport in isolation, especially those of us
                who live in the border areas. There needs to be greater
                co-ordination between services in the Republic of Ireland and
                Northern Ireland so that they complement each other, and it will
                require much greater collaboration to realise that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amount of resources required is probably
                our biggest challenge, but since Mr&nbsp;Prescott is the Deputy
                Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and since the Labour
                Government regard the use of public transport — the previous
                Government’s policy favoured road transport — as a desirable
                policy, we should be able to make a strong case. I hope that the
                Minister can get together with other Ministers in the Executive,
                including the Minister of Finance, Mr&nbsp;Durkan, and make this
                strong case. We are all looking for equality of treatment, and,
                if the application of the Barnett formula is around 40-1, surely
                we can make that case.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The European Union was referred to in the
                context of the structural funds, which are extremely important.
                The Belfast-Dublin railway line was upgraded largely because of
                European structural funds, and I believe that the Belfast-Bangor
                line is going to be improved with 75% grant aid from them. I
                hope that there can be some examination of the transitional
                programme’s application to Brussels, something else that will
                require the presentation of a strong, co-ordinated case. I thank
                Members for their support.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That this Assembly welcomes the Ulster Cancer
                Foundation’s document ‘Cancer Services — Invest Now’ and
                urges the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety
                to implement, as a matter of urgency, the recommendations
                contained in the report.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">May I start by saying that a delegation from
                the Ulster Cancer Foundation successfully lobbied at Westminster
                last week, and were promised support for the document that we
                are now debating. A delegation will make a presentation to our
                Health Committee tomorrow. However, we thought it appropriate to
                debate this motion today so that all Members can hopefully
                express their support for the funding needed for cancer
                services. I am delighted, as co-chair of the cross-party group
                on cancer issues, to present this motion today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the Ulster Cancer Foundation’s offices
                some weeks ago we had the public launch of the document ‘Cancer
                Services — Invest Now’. It was a moving experience for all
                who attended. Among the speakers, who included Assembly Members,
                were patients and carers who told their own stories and
                experiences about when their cancer was diagnosed. From their
                contributions, it was obvious that early diagnosis and treatment
                was vital, and that it was also necessary to have greater
                support and more information.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was made clear that proper financial and
                manpower resources are dangerously — and I use that word
                deliberately — inadequate for the prevention and treatment of
                the many types of cancer that are prevalent in Northern Ireland
                today. It is widely expected that deaths from cancer will
                outstrip those of Northern Ireland’s other killer, heart
                disease, in five&nbsp;years time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cancer is a condition feared by many, and
                with good reason. One in three people will be diagnosed with
                some sort of cancer; one in nine before the age of 45. More
                males than females die from cancer, and one of the reasons for
                this is the reluctance of men to go to clinics, which could lead
                to early detection and successful treatment — a publicity
                campaign some months ago illustrated that point. Statistics are
                sometimes misleading, but unfortunately those stating that we
                have had 8,700 new cases and approximately 3,700 deaths from
                cancer each year are facts, and if the situation is to change,
                it is likely that it will not be for the better.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the risk of being overdramatic —
                although for the numbers of Members presently in the Chamber it
                may not be too overdramatic — there is not a Member here today
                who has not, or will not, experience one form of cancer either
                personally or through their family or friends.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This was also the case at one of the first
                meetings of our cross-party group, when each of us gave our
                reasons, based on our personal stories, for supporting the
                Ulster Cancer Foundation, which has given 30&nbsp;years of
                commitment, help and direct support to cancer sufferers and
                their families. I know that other organisations are also engaged
                in similar work, and credit must be given to them as well, since
                without them, even more research and equipment would be needed
                than is the case at present.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I come now to the terms of the motion. The
                document ‘Cancer Services — Invest Now’ is a response to
                the recent report by Dr&nbsp;Henrietta&nbsp;Campbell, ‘Cancer
                Services — Investing for the Future’. The Ulster Cancer
                Foundation’s report was drawn up in association with leading
                cancer clinicians such as Prof&nbsp;Roy&nbsp;Spence and
                Prof&nbsp;Patrick&nbsp;Johnston from Belfast City Hospital’s
                cancer centre, from cancer units and from the excellent patients’
                forum of the Ulster Cancer Foundation itself. It heartily
                supports the Campbell report’s major recommendations, but
                states that investment for the reorganisation and development of
                cancer services should happen not in the future, but now. This
                opinion is based on the day-to-day knowledge and experience of
                clinicians and on research which clearly points out that
                patients living in the United Kingdom have approximately a
                20%-30% worse survival rate than their counterparts living in
                countries such as Switzerland and Holland and the USA.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The objectives of the Campbell report are
                also welcomed, and it is acknowledged that these major changes
                would result in significant benefits for cancer patients,
                including, among other things, on-site access to a full range of
                acute services and a high-quality patient environment, something
                which is extremely important. Many aspects of the report are
                being implemented, but there are still problems with the proper
                training of staff and with providing specialists in, for
                instance, chemotherapy treatment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also a clear need for more
                oncologists for actual diagnosis. There are 10 oncologists
                rather than the 20 or 30 necessary to enable the number of
                patients we have here to be dealt with expertly and quickly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Great strides have been made in the reduction
                of deaths and in the increase of successful outcomes in breast
                cancer cases, and work is being done on the early detection of
                other common cancers such as stomach and prostate. The most
                common type is, of course, still regrettably lung cancer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Resources must be ring-fenced. I know that
                the Minister is aware and supportive of this, but expert staff
                and resources must be put into the new cancer centres as quickly
                as possible to save lives. We cannot afford to wait. It is
                estimated that proper implementation of the Campbell report will
                require £24&nbsp;million instead of the current
                £13·9&nbsp;million. Such an increase, although massive at
                first sight, will be well worth it for every family in the
                Province.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Such investment would directly save lives and
                improve the situation for cancer sufferers. That is the bottom
                line of which we must never lose sight. I hope that Members will
                support the motion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have said enough about what is happening,
                but it would be fitting to end my address by stating the
                conclusion of the Ulster Cancer Foundation’s document ‘Cancer
                Services — Invest Now’:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;It is no longer acceptable for us as a
                society to accept a situation where a set of diseases that
                affects one in three of our population and results in the death
                of one in four people is not adequately resourced and tackled in
                order to bring our survival figures for cancer up to those seen
                in the best European countries such as Switzerland and Holland
                or indeed that seen within the United States. It is therefore
                imperative that we as a society speak out about the inadequacy
                of resourcing, both in terms of personnel, and the provision and
                development of this clinical service for patients until such
                time as this issue is properly addressed.&quot;</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairman of the Health, Social Services
                and Public Safety Committee (Dr&nbsp;Hendron): </b>First, I
                would like to thank Mrs&nbsp;Eileen&nbsp;Bell and
                Mr&nbsp;Paul&nbsp;Berry for bringing this most important subject
                before the Assembly<b>.
                </b>
 Mr&nbsp;Michael&nbsp;Woods, the chief
                executive of the Ulster Cancer Foundation, who is sitting in the
                Gallery, has given many years’ service in the fight against
                cancer and is about to retire. I know we all wish him well.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have no doubt that every Member welcomes
                the Ulster Cancer Foundation’s document ‘Cancer Services —
                Invest Now’. We most certainly urge the Minister of Health,
                Social Services and Public Safety to implement as a matter of
                urgency the recommendations in the report. I would like to thank
                the Minister for being here for the debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The facts are there for all of us to see. The
                professional experts and statisticians have spoken and action is
                needed now. Furthermore, I guess that every Member has someone
                in his immediate or extended family who has cancer or who has
                died from it. Therefore, we can no longer be complacent. The
                Ulster Cancer Foundation, Action Cancer, MacMillan Cancer Relief
                and similar organisations, all deserve our thanks. I cannot help
                but think of Dr&nbsp;Gerry&nbsp;Lynch who worked for so many
                years in Belvoir Park Hospital — it used to be called
                Montgomery House. He played a major role there and has himself
                succumbed to cancer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A key concern of patients is waiting time and
                the uncertainty that produces. I am not just talking about
                waiting time for the first appointment but about the time spent
                waiting for test results, for further appointments and for
                treatment to start. The Calman Hine Report, to which
                Mrs&nbsp;Bell has already referred, was the first major report
                in these islands that attempted to draw the various strands of
                cancer, diagnosis and treatment together. It was a major report
                and it led to a re-organisation of cancer services throughout
                the United Kingdom. Following that, our own Chief Medical
                Officer, Dr&nbsp;Ella&nbsp;Campbell, produced her report, which
                has also been referred to. Many of her recommendations have been
                or are being implemented.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Belfast City Hospital as everyone knows
                is to contain the main cancer centre for Northern Ireland and be
                supplemented by four cancer units. Patients should be managed by
                multi-disciplinary cancer teams. That is a key point in all this
                re-organisation. That was the reason the move was made to
                Belfast City Hospital, and those who had loved ones treated in
                Belvoir Park Hospital felt very strongly about that. Indeed, at
                one time I supported retaining all the services at Belvoir Park,
                but I was wrong. The experts on the subject were totally
                correct, so services including radiotherapy and chemotherapy,
                are to be situated at the City Hospital. Its cancer registry, on
                which there has been a major move forward, is to be adequately
                resourced. It is only in recent times that we have had a
                register of cancer in Northern Ireland and, indeed, on the
                island of Ireland. Dr&nbsp;Anna&nbsp;Gavin is leading on this.
                Since we now have a standardisation of the figures for cancer,
                proper comparisons can be made with the figures of other
                countries.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to cancer research, Members will
                know that last year a memorandum was signed at Stormont by the
                then Health Minister, George&nbsp;Howarth, the Republic’s
                Health Minister, Brian&nbsp;Cowen, and by the Secretary of
                Health from the United States.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr&nbsp;Ric&nbsp;Klausner, Director of the
                National Institute for Cancer at Bethesda in Maryland, played a
                pivotal role in these matters as did
                Prof&nbsp;Patrick&nbsp;Johnston, professor of Oncology at Queen’s
                and Prof&nbsp;Roy&nbsp;Spence, senior cancer surgeon at the City
                Hospital. I am delighted to see the Minister of the Environment
                here, Mr&nbsp;Sam&nbsp;Foster, as he was a spokesperson for
                health at that time. He and I played some small role in
                promoting that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While this development is to be warmly
                welcomed, we must nevertheless face the fact that the amount
                currently spent on cancer services in Northern Ireland is around
                £13·9 million, yet it would take about £24 million per year
                to provide the type of services needed. I agree with the
                conclusions in the Ulster Cancer Foundation’s document, and
                this point was also made by Mrs&nbsp;Bell. It is no longer
                acceptable for us as a society to accept a situation in which so
                many people are dying of cancer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must bring our survival figures for cancer
                up to those in other countries such as Switzerland, Holland and
                the Unites States of America. Prevention is better than cure and
                early diagnosis usually leads to a much better prognosis. In
                comparison with cardiovascular disease, it is projected that
                within the next five years cancer will be the biggest killer in
                our society.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Health Promotion Agency and health action
                zones must be properly resourced to teach our children and young
                people to have a healthier lifestyle. Much will be said over the
                coming months about health action zones. Each child and young
                person should be encouraged to know and understand the European
                code against cancer. It should be mandatory in the education
                system that each child be taught the cancer code. I pay tribute
                to our Chief Medical Officer, Dr&nbsp;Etta&nbsp;Campbell, in
                whose annual report a lot of these matters have been
                highlighted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Apart from genetic factors, smoking is by far
                the biggest cause of cancer in Northern Ireland. Excess and
                persistent alcohol intake is another factor. Research throughout
                the world has consistently shown that increasing your daily
                intake of vegetables and fresh fruit results in better health. I
                do not have a share in the production of fruits and vegetables,
                but five portions of fruit and vegetables, in whatever
                combination, on a daily basis can play a major role in cancer
                prevention. That point is accepted round the western world and
                parents should emphasise that to their children. For years,
                cereals with high fibre content have also been known to help
                prevent cancer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then we have the sun and suntan. A
                dermatologist in the Belfast City Hospital gave a talk one time
                on the subject of melanoma and the many deaths that result from
                melanoma in Northern&nbsp;Ireland. Years ago we remember people
                in movements in the United States of America saying &quot;Black
                is beautiful&quot;. In relation to melanoma, white is beautiful
                and people should remember that. I have never seen a happy face
                lying in the sun on my many holidays. I would love to elaborate
                on that point, but I am sure that I would be ruled out of order.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Obesity is another factor, and we need to
                limit fatty foods. Physical activity on a daily basis is very
                important. These points are all known. Young people nowadays do
                not participate in enough physical activity. Certainly, families
                that queue up for burgers and such rubbishy food — and I have
                been guilty of this many times — are preparing their children
                for atherosclerosis in their coronary arteries in later years.
                They are also setting up the conditions for cancer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At least two out of three cancer-related
                deaths are preventable. I said at the beginning that action is
                needed now. I know the Minister wants to do everything she can,
                but I do implore her to take that action and to make sure that
                the necessary resources are ring-fenced.</p>

                the Member winding-up and for the Minister. That will keep us
                within the two hours allocated for this debate.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Foster:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also a member of the all-party group on
                cancer care, and I am keen to contribute to the debate as cancer
                care is an issue of the utmost importance to us all.
                Responsibility for cancer care falls to the Minister of Health,
                Social Services and Public Safety. As future funding for health
                has yet to be decided by the Executive, I wish to make it clear
                that I am speaking from the Back Benches as a Member for
                Fermanagh and South Tyrone and not as a Minister or a Member of
                the Executive Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In spite of the research and technical
                advances, which have been made in almost every other area of
                medicine, the stark fact remains that cancer affects one third
                of the local population and results in the death of almost one
                person in four. The death rate from cancer in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland has almost tripled since the state was
                founded in 1921 and has even doubled since the introduction of
                the National Health Service. In the past 30&nbsp;years we could
                have argued that we were at war with terrorism. It is now time
                to declare a new war on cancer, which will soon be the biggest
                killer in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Northern Ireland more people are killed by
                cancer in one year than have died during the past 30&nbsp;years
                of the troubles. Each year three thousand seven hundred people
                die due to cancer. If you break this figure down it is the
                equivalent of 308&nbsp;people dying each month, 71 each week and
                10 each day. That is frightening — in fact, it is terrifying.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As many of you know, I was my party’s
                former spokesman on health, and I was also a member of the
                Health Committee in the Northern Ireland Forum. During that
                period, I was directly involved with Prof Roy Spence, Prof Paddy
                Johnston and Dr Joe Hendron in securing a tripartite agreement
                with the National Cancer Institute in the USA and with health
                representatives in the Republic of Ireland to initiate greater
                awareness of cancer and to promote excellence in cancer care in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My involvement increased my admiration for
                the tremendous work of Prof&nbsp;Spence, Prof&nbsp;Johnston, Mr
                Michael Wood and his colleagues in the Ulster Cancer Foundation.
                I am well aware of the competing claims from various sectors for
                public funding but I believe that the case made by the Ulster
                Cancer Foundation report is very well founded.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Everyone accepts that there is presently no
                cure for every case of cancer, but there is a great deal of
                evidence which shows that survival rates could be much improved
                if we funded and provided services and facilities flexible
                enough to meet the ever increasing demands. Service provision
                will be expensive, and the implementation of the report would
                require that we almost double the current spend on cancer
                services from £14&nbsp;million to £24&nbsp;million per year.
                However, the implementation of the report would, if we go by
                evidence from America and some European countries, result in a
                20% to 30% improvement in survival rates. From a political,
                social, medical and moral perspective that would indeed be money
                well spent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Questions will be asked about where the money
                might come from. The Chancellor, Gordon&nbsp;Brown, received
                over £22&nbsp;billion from mobile phone licences. If that money
                were directed into cancer care in the United Kingdom there would
                be no great problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ulster Cancer Foundation is not calling
                for money to fund cancer services from other parts of the health
                budget to facilitate this but is, in fact, calling for an
                increase in the block grant from Westminster. As things stand,
                and in the continuing absence of further funding, it is
                calculated that in a decade cancer could be the number one
                killer in Northern&nbsp;Ireland, responsible for almost
                30&nbsp;deaths in every hundred.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As an Assembly, we cannot, we should not, and
                we must not accept a situation where a set of diseases, known
                under the common name of cancer, continue to either kill or
                seriously impair an increasing number of our population. The
                motto of the Ulster Cancer Foundation is &quot;from care to
                cure&quot;. The Assembly cannot provide the cure for cancer but
                we do have the responsibility for ensuring that cancer services
                are given the highest possible priority in the allocation of
                funds to provide the necessary care. I am pleased to support the
                motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr R Hutchinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the debate on this timely and very
                important issue. I support the motion and thank the Members for
                bringing it to the House. Unique is the man or woman who can
                stand here today and say that he or she has not been affected by
                cancer in some way whether through personal experience or the
                loss of a loved one. We have heard how one in three people can
                expect to experience cancer at some time during their lifetime.
                Given such alarming statistics, 36 of the 108&nbsp;Members in
                the Chamber can expect to have first-hand experience of this
                illness at some time during their lifetime.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One in four of the population will die from
                this disease. This is the reality that we must seek to confront.
                In my constituency of East Antrim, as in others, the death toll
                is rising on an annual basis. Between 1993 and 1995, 1,827 new
                cases were reported in the Northern Board area; 816&nbsp;deaths
                were confirmed, and concern is growing. By 2007, cancer will
                have overtaken heart disease as the number-one cause of fatality
                in Northern Ireland. I am glad that much progress has been made
                in recent years to break down the wall of silence that
                previously surrounded cancer and cancer deaths.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">MacMillan Cancer Relief, with its open-space
                campaign, pointed the way towards identifying a need to talk,
                and thankfully we are doing that here today. The Ulster Cancer
                Foundation’s ‘Invest Now’ campaign has much to recommend
                it. However, while promoting itself as a comprehensive document
                is not a solution to providing a better oncology service in
                Northern Ireland, it is a tentative first step in the right
                direction. The document is a broad overview of the optimum
                funding that must be secured to ensure an equity of access to
                high quality care for all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The document raises many questions which must
                be answered. How much of the money will go towards primary care?
                How much has been earmarked for palliative care? How many posts
                is it anticipated that this additional money will fund? What is
                the intended timescale for phasing in these appointments? The
                need exists not only to treat the number of new cases arising in
                the population more quickly, but also the number of prevalent
                cases — that is the number diagnosed in previous years who are
                still alive. What percentage of the funding will be used to
                allow these patients to have treatment near their homes? Each
                year more people are surviving due to new treatments, but many
                may need help in coping with the psychological and physical
                aspects of life after being diagnosed as having cancer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In our race to find the ultimate cure, we
                must not forget those who have fought this battle and won. One
                key concern people have is waiting time. I want to see this
                money invested in the re-design of services to meet the needs of
                patients, to reduce waiting times for referral, investigation
                and treatment and to tackle head-on the shortage that presently
                exists in the number of specialist medical and skilled nursing
                staff in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Calman Hine Report of 1995 agrees with
                the Ulster Cancer Foundation’s recommendation for a cancer
                centre plus four cancer units based on the view that
                specialisation will improve outcomes. However, we must ensure
                that all four units receive an adequate share of the funding and
                that training initiatives are put in place to provide the
                necessary skills for doctors, nurses and other professionals
                allied to medicine. Northern Ireland is well below its European
                counterparts in standards of care and rates of survival, all too
                often ranking alongside eastern block countries. By supporting
                this motion today we can as least begin to redress the balance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion.</p>
                <i>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr O’Connor:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I too support the motion. The statistics are
                that in Northern&nbsp;Ireland, one in three people will get
                cancer; one in four will die from it; and that 3,700 deaths per
                annum are cancer related.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We in Northern Ireland are disadvantaged. Our
                survival rate is between 20% and 30% lower than countries such
                as France, Holland and Switzerland. We are supposed to be part
                of the developed world, yet we still rank alongside Latvia and
                Poland when it comes to cancer treatment. We are not as advanced
                as we like to think.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Campbell report, which Dr Hendron
                mentioned, proposes a regional cancer centre and four cancer
                units. Today we are thinking about a regional cancer centre
                based at the Belfast City Hospital. Although I support the
                motion, I question the necessity to have everything in Belfast.
                Only 20% of the population live there. I am concerned about
                putting a regional cancer centre in the City Hospital to the
                detriment of the rest of Northern Ireland. Cross-border
                co-operation is increasing. Perhaps there is potential for an
                all-Ireland centre of excellence, possibly in Armagh. We could
                charge the Southern Government for treating their cancer
                patients. That would help subsidise cancer services in our own
                area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cancer-related expenditure is
                £13·9&nbsp;million when we really need £24&nbsp;million.
                Three years from now we will need £31&nbsp;million to
                adequately resource cancer treatment. The projected spend for
                the next three years does not come near to meeting those
                requirements. Throughout Britain, less than 1% of the drugs
                budget is spent on cancer drugs. Taxanes have had considerable
                success in stopping cancers. In particular, combinations such as
                Taxol plus platinum are very effective in arresting ovarian
                cancer. The cost is £1,500 per treatment, and normally eight
                treatments are required, so it costs £12,000 to treat one
                patient.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We only have 10·5 cancer surgeons. We really
                need 25. Are we going to continue to sell the people of this
                country short? We were elected to deliver. As Mr R Hutchinson
                and Mrs Bell said, everyone has a relative or friend who has
                suffered or died from cancer. We need to deliver. People’s
                lives have to be worth something. If we continue to underfund
                this service, people will not get the treatment they need. Every
                year 3,700 people die from cancer in this country. That is more
                than the number of lives lost in the whole 30 years of the
                troubles.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Environment — I know he was
                speaking in a personal capacity as the Member for Fermanagh and
                South Tyrone — said that there is a lot of co-operation. The
                point I want to get across is that Dr Hendron and Mr Foster’s
                tripartite agreement to improve the situation in Northern
                Ireland is all well and good but if the money is not there to
                deliver the services, that is where it hits home. Those 3,700
                people are being sold short. The Minister said that not all
                cancers are curable, and we accept that, but much can be done to
                relieve suffering and many people can be cured.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Colleague, Dr&nbsp;Hendron, mentioned
                problems resulting from smoking, alcohol and diet. I am not very
                qualified to speak on that matter because I am a smoker.
                However, socially disadvantaged areas tend to have a greater
                proportion of people who smoke, drink and have poor diets. When
                we talk about targeting social need, we need to consider those
                people at the end of the social scale who have poor diets and
                who do smoke and drink more heavily than people on higher
                incomes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister has just left, but there are
                also a number of environmental concerns which need to be
                considered. Several questions were raised concerning emissions
                from Sellafield. We have heard about emissions such as sulphur
                dioxide from power stations. All these emissions are
                carcinogenic. These problems need to be investigated; our people
                cannot continue to be pushed aside.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We were elected here to deliver and if we
                cannot deliver an extra £10&nbsp;million this year — which is
                a tiny proportion of our whole expenditure for Northern Ireland
                — then there is something drastically wrong with us. I think
                there will be very few dissenters here on the question of making
                the extra money available. The Minister will have plenty of
                support in the House if she takes this forward to the Executive,
                which I hope she does. Finally, 41% of men and 36% of women will
                get some form of invasive cancer. It could be me, it could be
                any one of us. The decisions that we take now are going to
                impact upon what may, or may not, happen to ourselves. I urge
                people to support this motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a Member of the Assembly cross-party group
                on cancer care, I support the motion. Like my Colleagues, I urge
                the Minister to act on this issue as a matter of urgency. I want
                to congratulate the Ulster Cancer Foundation for persisting with
                its message. The increased awareness of the issues involved is
                very valuable and is an important part of learning how to tackle
                the problems. The foundation’s document ‘Cancer Services:
                Invest Now’ is an agenda for action which none of us, and I
                repeat, none of us, can afford to ignore.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The statistics have been mentioned over and
                over again in this Chamber. Whether it is one in three, or one
                in four, the fact is that each of us will be touched by this
                terrible disease at some time. More than 8,000 people in
                Northern Ireland and their families are affected by cancer every
                year — there are more than 8,000 deaths in a year. What I like
                to do often is to compare our situation with that of our
                European neighbours and the rest of the world.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we consider the survival rates then all we
                can do is bow our heads in shame. The survival rate in the
                United Kingdom is 20% to 30% worse than that in Switzerland, or
                Holland, or the United States. We have just 10&nbsp;consultant
                oncologists, whereas other European countries would have
                30&nbsp;oncologists caring for that size of population. What are
                the problems, and how do we go about resolving them? Obviously,
                as we have seen from the figures, there is a lack of funding and
                resources, a lack of medical oncologists, a lack of
                multi-disciplined teams, an inability to access — and quickly
                access — new drugs, and a lack of structure for clinical
                funds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Current spending on cancer services is
                £13·9&nbsp;million but the services require some
                £24&nbsp;million, perhaps even £30&nbsp;million. An extra
                £10&nbsp;million at least is definitely needed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to conclude on a note of optimism.
                Yesterday, President Clinton and Prime Minister Blair announced
                a medical breakthrough which, believe it or not, has been ranked
                alongside landing on the moon and the creation of the wheel in
                terms of the impact it will have on society. What happened
                yesterday was tremendous and I am slightly surprised that it has
                been bypassed in a blink of an eye. As a result of the discovery
                it is said that our lifespan will increase by 25&nbsp;years as
                of yesterday. There might well be an element of hype in its
                presentation, but I think that we have turned the key and opened
                the book of life. Through this discovery I hope that scientists
                will be able to find cures for the major diseases facing society
                today. I hope that a cure for cancer will be top of the priority
                list.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Carson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some words strike terror in people’s hearts
                and none more so than the word cancer. It is one of the most
                dreaded words in our language and is on a par with what
                tuberculosis was in the 1930s, ‘40s and ‘50s. Cancer
                engenders a fear of the unknown, a fear of the treatment
                involved, a fear of surgery, of chemotherapy, of radiotherapy
                — and perhaps of the possibility that there might be no cure.
                Tuberculosis was eliminated by penicillin and people hope for a
                similar cure for cancer. Cancer is the second largest cause of
                death in Northern Ireland, cardiac problems being the first. It
                accounts for 26% of all deaths. Statistics show that this
                disease is on the increase. It shows no sign of decreasing,
                mostly due to the ageing population and our lifestyles. Northern
                Ireland is an example in Europe of poor health and
                under-resourced services. I wonder if the underresourcing is a
                consequence of direct rule and the lack of funding for research
                a result of no direction from locally elected people. It might
                be the case.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Assembly Members must take responsibility to
                ensure that adequate funds are found to deliver the necessary
                service. At the moment, there are only 10 oncologists in
                Northern Ireland and we are told that we require 30 to provide
                effective treatment. To have more oncologists we need more
                money. At the moment there are only 10 oncologists in Northern
                Ireland, but we are told that 30 are required to ensure
                effective treatment of the community.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Expenditure is currently £13 million, but we
                should be spending £24 million. Every area of the Health
                Service is competing for funding, but it is clear from what we
                have heard that more money is needed for cancer services. In
                Northern Ireland we are privileged to have a centre of
                excellence for cancer research in Belfast City Hospital. The
                excellent pioneering research of its staff must be commended.
                If, however, they are to continue the work of finding a cure for
                this dreaded disease, they will require additional funding. I am
                encouraged by yesterday’s news, which Ms Morrice mentioned,
                that the Genome Project has successfully mapped the human
                genetic code. It is to be hoped that this will provide an
                important step forward in the search for an eventual cure for
                cancer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any advance in medicine has a financial cost,
                and it is clear that the projected figures for the financing of
                Northern Ireland’s cancer services fall short of what is
                necessary. As our population lives longer it is clear that our
                lifestyles must change. Public education is required on an
                ongoing and urgent basis, especially with regard to smoking,
                sunbathing and our national food habits. A change of habit may
                help reduce the incidence of cancer, but this is not enough. A
                concerted effort must be made by the Department of Health,
                Social Services and Public Safety and by all agencies to
                eradicate this disease. This requires extra financial input for
                all cancer services — education, research, staffing, training,
                and modern facilities. We must see that this is available. I
                support the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Boyd:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regrettably, due to poor diet and under
                resourcing of services, Northern Ireland has the worst cancer
                survival rates in Western Europe. One in three people will
                develop cancer in their lifetime, and one in four people will
                die from it. Sadly, both old and young have lost their lives
                through cancer. It can strike anyone at anytime. The worst
                survival rates are for Ulster men — just over half with the
                most serious cancers are still alive after one year, and 80% of
                our lung cancer patients die after a year. These are the worst
                figures in Europe.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In a recent report the Chief Medical Officer,
                Dr Henrietta Campbell, said that most cancers were preventable
                because lifestyle factors played an important part in their
                development. Tobacco-smoking and an unhealthy diet are
                responsible for two thirds of all cancer deaths. In Northern
                Ireland smoking claims 3,000 lives every year and causes
                illness, suffering and hardship to thousands more families. It
                is the single greatest preventable cause of ill health in
                Northern Ireland. Ulster people spend a staggering 55% more on
                cigarettes than the average for the United&nbsp;Kingdom as a
                whole. A 1998 survey revealed that households in Northern
                Ireland spend £8.50 a week on smoking, a massive £3 more than
                the UK average. Sadly, more children and young people are
                starting to smoke every year; recent research for Northern
                Ireland shows that 18% of teenage boys and 34% of teenage girls
                now smoke.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a responsibility, particularly for
                elected representatives, to reduce smoking and save lives.
                Smokers also have responsibilities to people who do not smoke.
                There are a small number of people who smoke in the corridors of
                this very Building which has a non-smoking policy. More funding
                must be made available to help educate the public, particularly
                young people, about the dangers of smoking. Such measures
                include controls on tobacco advertising, tough enforcement on
                under-age sales and changing attitudes to smoking through a
                major campaign. Attitudes and behaviour need to change to
                encourage a healthier lifestyle. In addition, increased funding
                is clearly required as a matter of urgency to combat cancer as a
                whole.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Four key steps need to be taken in order to
                tackle the disease. We need to put in place the best
                preventative measures; we need to provide the best treatments
                available; we need to ensure that people with cancer are given
                the highest standard of care and attention at all stages of
                their illness; and we need to invest in high quality research
                and development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Northern&nbsp;Ireland approximately
                8,700&nbsp;people develop cancer each year, and around
                3,700&nbsp;deaths from cancer occur each year. Cancer currently
                accounts for approximately 26% of all deaths in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland, and this trend is increasing. It is
                projected that in the next five to seven years cancer will be
                the biggest killer in our society. By 2007 it is likely that
                cancer will overtake heart disease as Northern&nbsp;Ireland’s
                number one killer. This is as a result of our ageing society as
                well as improving outcomes for people with cardio-vascular
                disease. Therefore cancer and its treatment will become a major
                burden on society for the foreseeable future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need an extra 140&nbsp;specialist nursing
                staff plus a range of new screening and education programmes. We
                already have some of the best clinicians, surgeons and
                oncologists, but they need resources and finances to carry out
                the necessary treatment. Prof&nbsp;Patrick&nbsp;Johnston, Head
                of Oncology at Belfast City Hospital, has stated that we need to
                increase the number of oncologists from 10 to 30. The current
                spending for cancer services in Northern&nbsp;Ireland is
                approximately £13·9&nbsp;million per annum. However, in order
                to provide the type of service that is required, funding of
                approximately £24&nbsp;million per year is needed. That is
                almost double the amount currently allocated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Great Britain just 95p per person is spent
                on anti-cancer drugs. In Germany it is £6·24. The critical
                issue of funding for cancer services highlights graphically the
                current folly of public funds being used foolishly by the
                Department. I refer to the United Kingdom taxpayers’ money
                being wasted by the Sinn Féin Health Minister. Much needed
                health funding is being spent unnecessarily on the Irish
                language. It must also be highlighted publicly that the amount
                of resources which are being used up due to paramilitary
                beatings and shootings could otherwise be directed to cancer and
                other much needed services if these illegal activities did not
                occur. We heard pleas for public funding in the debate on
                transport, which is a very worthy case. However, there is no
                greater case for increased public funding than that of cancer
                treatment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to publicly thank the various cancer
                charities for their tremendous fundraising work and for the help
                that they provide to those who suffer from the effects of cancer
                or whose families are affected. Society owes them a great debt
                and we, as elected representatives, must continue to support
                them in every way possible.</p>

                Services — Invest Now’ and urges the Minister of Health,
                Social Services and Public Safety to implement, as a matter of
                urgency, the recommendations contained in the report. That is a
                recommendation that we can all support. Indeed, Members have
                unanimously supported the motion and the call for a substantial
                and significant financial contribution to cancer services in the
                Province.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cancer will touch most of us, if not all of
                us, at some time in our lives. Some Members mentioned that their
                families have been affected by it. Indeed, my family has been
                touched by it too. If we do not develop some form of cancer it
                is highly likely that a loved one or a close relative will. Some
                of us have watched family or friends suffer and perhaps even die
                from this illness. Consequently most of us are only too well
                aware of the traumatising nature of this disease.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ulster Cancer Foundation’s report ‘Cancer
                Services — Invest Now’ is welcomed by everyone in the House.
                It is sad that there is an ever growing need for such services.
                Sadder still is the fact that the Ulster Cancer Foundation had
                to produce this document calling for adequate funding. It felt
                it had to because it is impossible to provide an efficient and
                effective service with the present inadequate funding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fact that the Ulster Cancer Foundation
                felt constrained to produce this report is an indication of its
                concerns. Cancer is a disease which crosses the boundaries of
                class, colour, race or creed. Young and old can all be affected
                by it. The document outlines the very frightening statistic that
                there are 8,700&nbsp;new patients every year and that 41% of
                males and 36% of females will develop some form of cancer at
                some stage in their lives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are about 20&nbsp;people in this
                Chamber at present, and if one in four were to die from cancer,
                then there would be five people who would not be in this Chamber
                in one year’s time. These are startling statistics, but they
                bring home how cancer will affect us. As other Members have
                pointed out, there could be 35 to 40 Assembly Members who could
                pass away from cancer, but that does not mean that they will.
                Rawls’ theory of justice states that the only fair way to make
                a decision or choice is to do so in the &quot;original
                position&quot; where we know nothing about our status or
                abilities. The layman’s interpretation is that those who
                participate in this debate may not necessarily get cancer, but
                there are those in this Chamber who will.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should put ourselves in the position of
                the people who will, or could, be cancer sufferers, and, if we
                do that, then we will hit upon what this debate is all about. It
                is essential that we do so and then ask ourselves how we would
                like to be treated. What drugs would we like to be made
                available? What standard of care and research would we expect or
                want to have been done? If we were to place ourselves in this
                position, I believe that we would all reach a similar conclusion
                — that we would want the maximum standard of care, the maximum
                standard of drugs, the maximum standard of research and the full
                implementation of Henrietta Campbell’s report entitled ‘Cancer
                Services — Investing for the Future’.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion is explicit and refers to a matter
                of urgency. I hope that all Members have either read, or have
                some knowledge of, the document and will be well aware of its
                recommendations. The Ulster Cancer Foundation calls for the full
                implementation of the ‘Cancer Services — Investing for the
                Future’ report, which is concerned with the reorganisation and
                improvement of services. There is no doubt that the Minister,
                the Department, and all of the elected representatives support
                the ethos of the report, but we need more than words, we need
                urgent action, and we need money — the words that were used
                earlier during the transport debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The document states that the current spend
                for cancer services in Northern Ireland is approximately
                £13·9&nbsp;million. This is grossly inadequate to provide the
                type of service required. The foundation suggests that in order
                to have an effective and adequate service, at least
                £24&nbsp;million a year is needed, but the Government’s
                allocated funding falls well short of that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The foundation also highlights the fact that
                as treatments become more complex, the required spend will most
                likely need to be significantly increased. In just a few years,
                it is likely that cancer will become the major killer in
                Northern Ireland — overtaking heart disease.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The concluding statement of this document is
                particularly significant, and I reiterate it and firmly support
                it. Its ethos is that it is entirely unacceptable that we, as a
                society, must accept such grossly inadequate resources to combat
                cancer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The United Kingdom has long prided itself on
                its western civilised status, and yet statistics reveal that the
                survival rate in Northern Ireland over the past five years was
                approximately 20% to 30% worse than that of Holland or France.
                Cancer survival rates for the UK have been consistently low and
                are comparable to countries in the previous eastern European
                block. When we consider those figures, it gives us an idea of
                how bad the incidences of cancer are in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, statistics tell us that the
                problem will only get worse. Now is the time for action to
                reform and improve cancer services in Northern Ireland.
                Inadequate funding will be the direct cause of death of the many
                patients who, with improved facilities — doctors, drugs and
                research — may have survived their illness.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At this juncture I will highlight the wider
                issues involved when Ministers take decisions about life and
                death, and it is important to bear in mind the human rights and
                European context. The impending implementation of the Human
                Rights Bill and its effect will mean that we must consider the
                convention rights when passing any Bill or making any decision.
                Possible litigation could arise out of a Minister’s decision
                if it were allowed, or if adequate funds were not provided, that
                would be a violation of Article&nbsp;2 of the Convention — the
                right to life.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In a recent case the European Court of Human
                Rights held that Governments have a positive duty to protect
                life and a duty not to make decisions that will cost the lives
                of those that they have a duty to protect.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no direct analogy to illustrate the
                problem of inadequate funding, but many human rights experts
                feel that it is only a matter of time, and considering the state
                our health service is going through, the scale of potential
                litigation would be wide and far reaching. That aspect should be
                considered carefully when any decision is made.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, I call for all Members to
                support the motion and I would urge the need for increased
                funding. I would remind Members that this issue potentially
                affects approximately 40% of our constituents. Consequently, we
                have a duty to use our position to urge the Department to make
                the only realistic option available and implement, as a matter
                of urgency, the recommendations contained in the report.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCarthy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion brought forward by my
                Colleague, Mrs&nbsp;Bell. I pay tribute to all the organisations
                in Northern Ireland that have been working tirelessly for many
                years to combat this most terrible of diseases.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is extremely sad to remark that with so
                much time, effort and money being utilised in research,
                treatment and provision, Northern Ireland still has an
                unacceptably high incidence of cancer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have said, on many occasions that the
                incidence of cancer in people living on the east coast has been
                higher than the national average. Some people might attribute
                this to the radioactive material that has been, and still is,
                discharged into the Irish Sea by the British Nuclear Fuels Ltd
                at Sellafield. If those discharges are causing, or partly
                causing, the unnaturally high level of cancer in this region,
                that dangerous operation should cease immediately. The concerns
                of my constituents in Strangford must be addressed now, as this
                problem has been ignored by the authorities for far too long.
                People have a right to know what is causing the appalling
                increase in the number of cancer incidents in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A recent report shows that Northern Ireland
                has the worse cancer survival rates in western Europe. That is
                totally unacceptable, but genuine efforts are being made to
                redress the situation. The Chief Medical Officer has stated —
                and this has been said already — that most cancers are
                preventable. Tobacco smoking and an unhealthy diet are
                responsible for two thirds of all cancer deaths. Surely, with
                regard to those two particular areas, much more should be done
                through education and by cutting back consumption of tobacco
                products. Efforts have been made, and are continuing to be made,
                to reduce the level of tobacco advertising, but we must go much
                further. Tobacco is a deadly drug. How does the Government deal
                with other deadly drugs? The answer may lie there.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister, in her recent reply to my
                request to fully implement the Ulster Cancer Foundation
                document, stated her Department’s commitment to the Campbell
                Report. She also informed me of the provision of a further
                £8&nbsp;million for the improvement of cancer research and
                treatment services in addition to an extra £7&nbsp;million
                provided last year. The money is most welcome, but more is
                needed. The Minister also said that she wished to see more
                specialist staff, oncologists and nurses being introduced into
                this branch of the health service. I reiterate the urgent need
                for the authorities to face this disturbing problem, but at the
                same time recognise the strain currently placed on the Health
                Service. The people of Northern Ireland must receive the best
                cancer services possible and we in the Assembly must not fail to
                provide them. I appeal to the Minister to adopt the Ulster
                Cancer Foundation document. I support the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr J Kelly:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A LeasCheann Comhairle, I support the motion.
                I should like to say at the outset that I congratulate and thank
                Eileen&nbsp;Bell and Paul&nbsp;Berry for bringing this motion
                before the House. We must also congratulate Michael&nbsp;Wood,
                who is in the Gallery, for the tremendous work he and his
                colleagues have done in promoting the Ulster Cancer Foundation,
                and of course, Prof&nbsp;Roy&nbsp;Spence and
                Prof&nbsp;Patrick&nbsp;Johnston.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A LeasCheann Comhairle, I have been in a
                cancer hospital both as patient and visitor, and it would be
                remiss not to pay tribute to those in the medical profession —
                nurses and doctors — who service that most sensitive area of
                hospitalisation. At this juncture we should also pay tribute to
                the hospices for their tremendous work in caring for people in
                the last weeks, days or hours of their lives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was not here yesterday, a LeasCheann
                Comhairle I was at a funeral. A young woman of 55 died on
                Saturday after battling cancer for a year. It occurred to me
                that, within the last 18&nbsp;months, I have been at
                11&nbsp;such funerals of young women within a 20-mile radius who
                have been afflicted by the dreadful disease, cancer, and who
                have died from their affliction.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One cannot help but notice the sorrow and
                hardship that the loss of a mother brings to her young family
                and husband, and the community in general. Echoing what other
                Members have said, there is no doubt in my mind that cancer is a
                growing killer in society. Cancer literally eats away at lives
                throughout the community. It eats away at those upon whom the
                community depends so much — young mothers who, perhaps having
                reared their children to school-going or university age, are
                taken away from them by this disease.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jane&nbsp;Morrice has mentioned the genetic
                breakthrough we read about this morning, which was compared to
                man’s landing on the moon for the first time. Yet already
                controversy is arising from the billions spent on coming to what
                we hope will be an extremely worthwhile genetic breakthrough.
                Indeed, other medical people question the wisdom of this
                expenditure when we do not yet have a solution to simple
                problems like the pollution of water.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, we cannot be begrudgers, and we must
                welcome this breakthrough and hope that it will not be
                misdirected for commercial reasons or at disadvantaged people
                perhaps found to be genetically imperfect. I felt we might put
                down a marker on that. As I said, we support the Ulster Cancer
                Foundation report, and we are convinced by the argument that
                cancer is the greatest killer in society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have a number of concerns about the
                approach taken in the document. Our first relates to the
                somewhat narrow focus on the requirements for the curative
                service, and while we do not wish to downplay the importance of
                these services, we should all remember that most cancers are
                preventable diseases, resulting from the material, environmental
                and lifestyle factors already referred to. We do not believe it
                is enough simply to note the rising number of cancer cases and
                then to ask for adequate curative services in response. A more
                long-term but effective approach would be to concentrate on the
                question of why the rates are rising, and what society can do to
                halt, then reverse this trend.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Resources will need to be divided evenly
                between curative and preventative services. Moreover, we do not
                believe that responsibility for tackling cancer and other health
                issues should be confined to the Health Service. All Government
                agencies should be required to take responsibility for the
                health impact of their policies, and that goes back to the
                argument on the environment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also note that the report, whilst it takes
                note of Campbell’s recommendation to develop
                multi-disciplinary teams, emphasises the number of consultants,
                oncologists and surgeons required. So, we are saying to the
                Minister, and to you, a LeasCheann Comhairle, that the response
                to the cancer service is to &quot;invest now.&quot;</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly lacks fiscal autonomy, and we
                depend on the block grant allocated by the British State to the
                Assembly and subsequently to the Department of Health, Social
                Services and Public Safety. We believe that it is only by
                instituting democratically controlled tax-raising powers that
                services such as this will be provided with the financial
                resources required. Nevertheless, we hope that this report will
                provide further pressure for the provisions of adequate funds to
                invest in services essential to our community’s well-being.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A LeasCheann Comhairle, I hope my comments
                will be taken in the spirit in which they are meant, and that is
                with the desire to do everything possible to rid society of the
                scourge of cancer. We applaud the Ulster Cancer Foundation again
                for putting its case so clearly and we earnestly hope that this
                document will have the desired effect of leading to improved
                cancer services in the area. Thank you a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr William McCrea:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I believe that this subject deserves the
                support of every Member of the Assembly. I appreciate that the
                Chamber is not full because of the staggered lunch arrangements,
                meetings, and Members attending different functions. However, I
                genuinely believe that there is unanimous support for action to
                be taken as suggested by the Ulster Cancer Foundation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to express my appreciation to
                Michael Wood, Director General of Ulster Cancer Foundation and
                the other members of that organisation for their presentation
                and the copy of the report given to each Member. I trust that
                Michael knows that his excellent service has been deeply
                appreciated and will be appreciated in the coming years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would also like to thank Mrs Bell and Mr
                Berry for bringing forward the motion because it is important
                that we discuss a matter that is causing great concern. Many
                people fear even the mention of the word, and when they feel ill
                and go to the doctor, one of their fears, if they cannot
                attribute the pain or the sickness to any other disease or
                sickness, is that the doctor will say it is cancer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many people fear the mention of the name, and
                many fear even to talk about the disease because they want to
                close their eyes, somehow, to the reality of their sickness, or
                to the pain that it will cause to their family circles. However,
                I believe that whenever the doctor does diagnose cancer that
                does not necessarily mean that the next word is death.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is right to say that, because of the
                excellent scientific advances, many cancers can be cured and we
                would urge people to help doctors in the early diagnosis of the
                disease. This is one very important point: we should urge people
                to get tests done rather than carry a cross on their shoulders
                about what it might be. They should get treatment as quickly as
                possible.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are alarming statistics in the report,
                but statistics do not do justice to the individual stories of
                pain and suffering behind them, and I say that as someone whose
                father-in-law and mother-in-law were both diagnosed as having
                cancer inside a matter of days. My wife and our family circle
                nursed them as best we could, ensuring that they spent the rest
                of their days comfortable, and with a meaningful life until it
                was in the purpose and plan of God to call and take them home.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are talking here about something that
                affects every grouping. The age or the sex of a person means
                nothing. Every group in society, and nearly every family in
                society, can, at some time, put a hand out and touch someone,
                among their loved ones, who has suffered from cancer, and
                sitting here today, not one of us knows exactly what that word
                might mean to us or what such an experience might mean to our
                families.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are talking about something that is very
                real, not something imaginary. We are facing a great reality.
                The other reality is that we need resources to fight this
                disease, to get the necessary research done that will enable
                scientific and medical progress. Some people do not have access
                to particular drugs because they are very costly. People have
                come to me about the drugs they need, or believe would help.
                Some are told that in their cases, they might not be of great
                help, or because of uncertainties some are denied them. If
                cancer comes to our homes or family circles, we will want to
                ensure that everything humanly possible is done to save the life
                or lives of our loved ones.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank my Colleagues and Friends in the
                Assembly for moving this motion. I trust that we have
                highlighted a very human problem today and, indeed, that action
                will be taken and the financial resources made available to let
                our people live.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hussey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate those who have brought this to
                the attention of the House. The motion has been well and widely
                debated. We are talking about ‘Cancer Services — Invest Now’.
                We can all concur with the remarks made by Dr&nbsp;McCrea that
                cancer does not necessarily mean death, though too often it
                does. Through the provision of services we may be able to ensure
                a higher survival rate, and that is vital. If one life can be
                saved, a good job will have been done today by this Body.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not want to broaden the issue too much,
                but I do want to move to one small area of prevention. Causes
                have been mentioned such as smoking and radon gas et cetera. A
                small reference was made to the large amount of money that was
                brought in by the sale of mobile telephone licences while there
                is concern about the possible effects of mobile phones. I
                request that the Minister, in addition to this motion, take
                serious note of the House of Commons Science and Technology
                Committee’s Report of 22&nbsp;September 1999. It was the ‘Scientific
                Advisory System: Mobile Phones and Health’. If there is a
                means of prevention, that report should be taken into account in
                the considerations that the Minister will be making.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I refer to one of its recommendations:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We recommend that the Government
                ensures that a higher priority is given to a research programme
                into the health impacts of mobile phones&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One does not want to scaremonger, but it is
                highlighted that much research is needed in that area. I do not
                want such research to detract from the immediate investment in
                cancer services to prevent deaths, if possible. I support the
                motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Health, Social Services and
                Public Safety (Ms de Brún): </b>Go raibh maith agat. Fáiltím
                roimh díospóireacht seo agus gabhaim buíochas leis na
                Teachtaí a bheartaigh ar an ábhar seo a thógáil. Tá mé
                sásta a fheiceáil go bhfuil an t-Uasal Michael Wood i láthair
                agus ba mhaith liom an deis seo a ghlacadh le buíochas a
                ghabháil leis agus le Fondúireacht Ailse Uladh agus leis na
                heagrais dheonacha eile a d’obair go crua thar na blianta in
                aghaidh na hailse.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome today’s debate, and I thank the
                Members who have raised the issue and brought it before the
                House. I am also glad to see that Mr&nbsp;Michael&nbsp;Wood is
                present, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank him,
                the Ulster Cancer Foundation and the many other charitable
                organisations that have worked throughout the years, with the
                services, in order to tackle this terrible disease.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I firmly believe that people here are
                entitled to internationally accepted standards of treatment and
                care. I welcome the report from the Ulster Cancer Foundation, an
                organisation which has provided much needed care and support for
                cancer patients for many years. It also provides resources for
                research and has funded the cancer registry. I am glad that the
                Ulster Cancer Foundation’s report strongly supports, and
                endorses, the recommendation of the Campbell Report on the
                reorganisation of cancer services. These services have changed
                out of all recognition over recent years. Indeed, the Cancer
                Foundation notes, as have Members during the debate, that many
                aspects of the Campbell Report are being implemented. Cancer
                units have been developed in our area hospitals where patients
                with more common cancers are being treated by specialist
                multi-disciplinary cancer teams.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, Belfast City Hospital and the
                Royal Victoria Hospital have been developed as a regional cancer
                centre. In line with the Campbell recommendations, radiotherapy
                and chemotherapy services, currently provided at Belvoir Park
                Hospital, will be relocated to the Belfast City Hospital. This
                will result in a state-of-the-art oncology centre, which will
                include the latest facilities and equipment. Work on this
                project is on course to be completed by 2003, and there is no
                doubt that this will be a world-class facility.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The new oncology centre is being developed as
                a public and private partnership, and we expect the preferred
                tender to be announced in the near future. In conjunction with
                this, a new day hospital for people with cancer will be
                established in the existing Tower Block, and it is expected that
                this will be funded by my Department on approval of the final
                business case.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the course of the debate much mention
                has been made of the number of oncologists, and, indeed, there
                has been progress, and further progress remains to be made.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the time of the Campbell Report there were
                only eight oncologists, and it was recommended, at that time,
                that this figure be increased to at least 13 by 2005. Currently
                there are 14 oncologists in post, with plans to increase this
                figure to 22 by 2005. However, there is a world-wide shortage of
                trained oncologists. These specialists take a number of years to
                train, and this raises difficulties in attaining the number we
                would wish. It is not simply a matter of resources.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Furthermore, while it is vital that we have a
                sufficient number of oncologists, a quality cancer service
                depends on having a wide range of other staff, including
                specialist surgeons, physicians, pathologists and nurses. In the
                debate questions have been asked as to why everything is in
                Belfast, but what I want to see is a network of care that
                ensures that people, no matter where they live, have access to
                good quality care and this network must encompass the cancer
                centre, cancer units and primary care. I recognise, as does my
                colleague Sam Foster, the pressure on the public purse and,
                obviously, any increase in the block fund would be very welcome
                indeed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As many Members have indicated, there is no
                doubt that every one of us in this room felt a personal impact
                as a result of this terrible disease and the toll that it takes.
                I am very aware of the toll for cancer sufferers, their
                families, carers and those throughout the service who work
                closely with them. I also pay tribute to the courage shown by
                all of those people who are battling against cancer. We need to
                do all we can to provide the best possible level of support. We
                all know someone who has suffered from cancer, or who has died
                from cancer. I can attest to that as it has been the case in my
                own experience recently. People do survive this disease and go
                on to live meaningful lives. Again I can attest to this from my
                own family. The courage people show in coming through this acts
                as a beacon to others going through times of difficulty. I also
                hope that people realise that Irish speakers are not immune to
                cancer and that people from all parts of our society suffer
                equally from this disease.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been mention of the ‘Eurocare
                Study’; this was an important study which revealed that there
                were great variations in outcomes from cancer treatment
                throughout Europe. What the study actually showed was that
                outcomes in England and Scotland were not significantly
                different from the European average. Irish cancer registries
                were not included in the study, however we have no reason to be
                complacent. I want to see cancer outcomes in our country being
                similar to those achieved in Switzerland, Holland and the USA.
                This will depend not only on having high-quality cancer hospital
                services but also on having excellent linkage and support for
                primary and palliative care. I fully support the work of the
                National Cancer Institute, the establishment of the important
                linkage between cancer specialists in Ireland and the USA. That
                is already bringing benefits to patients, as oncologists and
                specialist nurses on both sides of the Atlantic collaborate in
                caring for patients with cancer. It has also facilitated the
                collection of information on cancer incidences and outcomes on
                an all-Ireland basis through the cancer registries.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also recognise that the death toll is
                rising, and this is why we must direct our energies to
                implementing preventative action as well as ensuring good
                quality primary, acute and palliative care. The percentage of
                funding going into the various sectors will, in many cases,
                depend on local need, and I think that this will be best
                determined at local level.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also fully aware of public concern about
                radioactive waste, leakage and pollution, and this is an issue
                that needs to be kept under close scrutiny.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I certainly support the focus on prevention
                and education, and I would like to see this kind of initiative
                developed on an all-Ireland basis. Indeed, I think there is a
                need for a greater focus on prevention, particularly on
                initiatives to reduce tobacco smoking — another point that
                Members frequently mentioned during the debate (including those
                who recognise they need to give up smoking). Last year, my
                Department provided £0·5 million for smoking cessation
                programmes, including a major publicity campaign. Programmes for
                this year are currently being evaluated, and this will inform a
                strategy and action plan on smoking, which we hope to publish in
                the autumn.</p>
                <i>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cancer treatment waiting times are an issue
                of great concern. I am determined to reduce the length of time
                cancer patients have to wait for outpatient appointments. I am
                pleased to announce that a target of two weeks will be
                introduced for breast cancer patients from 1&nbsp;August. I
                intend to extend this target to other cancers within 18-24
                months. Tackling our waiting list problem is a priority issue.
                There can be no overnight solutions. Long-term strategies are
                required. The same applies to in-patient waiting times. I intend
                to bring forward in the near future a regional waiting list
                action plan, which will put in place the necessary strategies to
                reduce unacceptably long waits for all treatments, including
                cancer treatment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note the important point that early
                diagnosis is essential. To ensure that, public and professional
                education is vital. The new breast cancer waiting time target,
                which I have just announced, will be accompanied by guidance on
                early diagnosis of this disease. Further guidance will follow in
                the next 18-24 months.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all welcome the success of the human
                genome project. I have no doubt that, within our lifetime, this
                will result in the development of completely new ways of
                preventing and treating cancer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To come back to the question of funding, we
                need to ensure that allocations are such that the general health
                of our population is improved and, specifically, that we have
                funding to tackle this particularly terrible disease. I support
                the Ulster Cancer Foundation’s wish for an adequately
                resourced cancer service, as do we all. Many of the required
                changes will take time to implement, because of the need to have
                adequately-trained and skilled staff in place. This year, an
                additional £8&nbsp;million has been provided for cancer
                services, on top of the additional £7&nbsp;million last year.
                That shows the priority that we attach to this vital question. I
                am confident that the new funding will make a substantial
                contribution to the continuing development of our cancer
                services. I want to ensure that, in the years ahead, cancer
                services have and retain a high priority within my Department.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Everyone will be very pleased — although,
                as I am in the Chair, perhaps this should be regarded as being
                off the record — to hear your announcement of a two-week
                target for breast cancer, and also the considerable increase in
                the number of oncology specialists, which should be a tremendous
                improvement.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Berry:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Members for their kind words about
                Eileen Bell and myself. While we accept those kind words, I feel
                strongly that it was our duty to bring forward this motion and
                back the Ulster Cancer Foundation document. At the outset, I
                commend the tremendous work carried out by Mr Michael Wood and
                his staff at the foundation. There is no doubt that they have
                carried out tremendous work, over a number of years, in an
                effort to defeat this serious disease.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Few issues in modern society are as emotive
                as cancer. The very word provokes fear and worry on a
                considerable scale. Such statistics, if they are to be believed,
                do not present a very encouraging picture. It is clear from what
                has been said that Members have studied the Ulster Cancer
                Foundation’s report, and I want to make some further points
                with regard to that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all have a one in three chance of getting
                cancer. One in four will die from cancer. About one in nine are
                diagnosed with cancer before the age of 45. Men are more likely
                to die from cancer than women, and men are more likely than
                women to develop invasive cancer. Jim&nbsp;Shannon,
                Rev&nbsp;William&nbsp;McCrea and Derek&nbsp;Hussey have all made
                it very clear that cancer does not just affect the elderly. It
                happens to young people, to the middle aged and to many other
                people. When I went on a tour of Belfast City Hospital this
                really hit me. There is a perception in Northern Ireland that it
                is mainly women who get cancer. From the evidence in this book,
                it is quite clear that cancer affects, not only women, but men
                and young people. When I visited Belfast City Hospital I looked
                at one ward in the cancer unit, and I saw in front of me only
                young fellows, around my own age, who were all being treated for
                that terrible illness.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is extremely important that cancer is
                diagnosed early. This point has been raised several times. While
                recognising that there are many problems with data — in terms
                of determining if there is a real increase or simply better
                quality data — the figures present adequate evidence of a
                major health problem in this country. Perhaps what is most
                alarming is that the survival rate in Northern Ireland is not
                only very low in comparison to other countries, but also in
                comparison to the United Kingdom as a whole. While recognising
                that there are heavy demands on the taxpayer’s money across
                all levels of the Health Service and that we will never
                eliminate this terrible disease, or deaths from it, we should
                not be deterred from making a case for proper investment in this
                particular area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now is the time for us, as elected
                representatives, to lay down some markers as to where money
                should be directed in this country. We should not be deterred
                when we are confronted with the reality that efforts to prevent
                and cure cancer have been intensified as well as increased.
                There is a very real success story and many people, who in the
                past would have died sooner, are now able to live longer. Others
                whose quality of life would have been very much poorer now have
                an enhanced quality of life, thankfully. Research into both
                diagnosis and the forms of treatment has greatly improved. Today
                we aim to demonstrate to the Assembly that it is essential that
                the ‘Cancer Services – Invest Now’ is not merely heeded
                but, more importantly, becomes part of the planning within the
                Health Service and that it is catered for within the allocation
                of resources.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, having laid down the foundation,
                there has been very little progress towards getting the
                structure in place. That failure has been due to the lack of
                resources. Some may be tempted to think that this report does
                not matter too much since cancer treatment is ongoing. Others
                may be tempted to think that this is simply another reminder of
                the importance of the Health Service to all of us. This is not
                the case. The reality is illustrated in the following ways.
                First, cancer patients are being denied access to the very drugs
                required for their treatment. This is the equivalent of having a
                car without wheels. Secondly, there is a shortage of specialists
                to treat cancer patients.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That shortage is directly attributed to the
                lack of funds to employ specialists’ time. An injection of
                resources would increase the number of cancer specialists. That
                is necessary to meet current demand. Cancer patients are being
                denied access to high quality treatment when they need it
                because there are not enough specialists to deal with them.
                Thirdly, there is a very real need to ensure that the Campbell
                report is fully implemented. Until that is done, we will
                continue to have a less than adequate health quality cancer
                service. I have listened very closely to Members today. I
                listened closely to my Colleague Mr&nbsp;Roger&nbsp;Hutchinson
                as he enquired about where the money would be allocated. Only
                the Ulster Cancer Foundation can lay that out, as it has
                specific areas to allocate to. I have no doubt that the points
                that the Member raised will be taken on board by the Ulster
                Cancer Foundation when it goes to lobby the Health Department.
                The Member made very good points about primary care, palliative
                care, the shortage of specialist medical and nursing staff, and
                the need to reduce waiting times for patients. These, and many
                other issues, need to be addressed in the field of cancer
                services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All Members taking part raised very important
                points. Can we expect the taxpayer to keep on picking up the tab
                for providing medical services for those who show no interest in
                their own lives and who do not look after themselves? Members
                have mentioned the problems of smoking and alcohol abuse, and
                how people should try to help themselves more. They are very
                valid points and are very controversial matters in themselves.
                However, there is a need to remind people that certain
                activities can increase the likelihood of developing cancer. It
                is important that the message &quot;Look after your health
                before you have to be looked after&quot; continues to go out.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are many areas where the people of
                Northern Ireland can help themselves, but we must also commend
                the work of other cancer organisations across Northern Ireland
                and, indeed, the UK. We welcome this report, and it has been an
                honour to bring it forward today with Eileen&nbsp;Bell, but I
                must also pay tribute to Macmillan Cancer Relief. It has also
                contributed to the cancer services and in the effort to defeat
                this terrible disease over the years. It must be brought to
                Members’ attention that Macmillan Cancer Relief has invested
                £5 million across the four board areas in recent years. That
                includes specialist cancer and palliative care nurses. That is a
                great grant scheme available to cancer patients, which must also
                be supported. Members, and the Department of Health, must look
                carefully at, and listen clearly to, what has been said today.
                Waiting times must be dealt with, and proper information must be
                supplied to support cancer patients. Support, with the
                opportunity to talk to cancer patients, is another important
                issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have no doubt that every Member in the
                Chamber has had loved ones and relatives who have died because
                of this terrible disease. There are also Members who have had
                family members who, thankfully, have been successfully treated
                because of early diagnosis. We do not want to be scaremongers,
                but I believe that supporting this motion welcoming the Ulster
                Cancer Foundation’s document ‘Cancer Services — Invest Now’
                will go a long way in defeating this terrible disease.
                £13.9&nbsp;million is currently spent on cancer services. There
                is a need for £24&nbsp;million to bring services up to proper
                standards, and I believe that the Health Department must find
                that money urgently. Then, there will be light at the end of the
                tunnel for the people of Northern&nbsp;Ireland who are suffering
                because of the terrible disease of cancer, and also for their
                families.</p>

                question to the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment
                under Standing Order 20. Before I call the Minister I would like
                to explain how private notice questions, PNQs, are to be
                handled, since it is the first time that this matter has been
                dealt with in the House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A PNQ must be tabled in the Business Office
                before 10.30&nbsp;am on a Monday in the week during which an
                answer is sought. In accepting the question, the Business Office
                will consider three important issues: the urgency of the subject
                in question; the scale of importance to the public in having an
                answer; and whether sufficient notice has been given to the
                Minister to enable him or her to respond.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The question will be taken immediately before
                the start of the adjournment debate on Tuesday of that week. At
                that time I will call on the Minister to provide an answer. At
                the end of the answer I will call the questioner to pose any
                supplementary, and other Members may also indicate their
                intention to pose supplementary questions. However, given the
                limited notice of these questions I will be paying close
                attention to the relevance of any supplementary to the subject
                matter of the initial question. I will stick very firmly to
                that. There will be no excursions into matters that do not
                relate to this question. I will rule out of order any question
                without a direct and clear relationship to the original
                question.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In total I would expect to dispose of these
                matters in 15 to 20&nbsp;minutes, although in future it might
                not be unusual to take two or more PNQs together. In the case of
                the question before us, I am grateful to the Minister for
                agreeing to respond against quite tight time constraints and
                also given the lack of precedent for how these matters are to be
                handled.</p>

                I wish to thank the Minister for his answer. Is the Minister
                aware, and he has touched on this in his answer, that there was
                to have been an announcement on 12 May on a possible takeover of
                Transtec by another company, and if that is the case, can he
                state that the jobs of the 300 workers employed in the Campsie
                factory will be safeguarded?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot confirm that that announcement was
                due on 12 May but what I can say is that I am aware that
                intensive negotiations are currently ongoing with a very
                reputable automative industry company that would instil
                confidence in us that they are very significant players in their
                field. As you know, the Ford Motor Company is also the principal
                customer at Campsie and the receivers, Arthur Andersen together
                with the IDB, are rigorously pursuing the negotiations. These
                negotiations are at an advanced stage, but we cannot say for
                certain when there will be a result. Similarly, it would be
                wrong to go further than to say, as I did in my original answer,
                that, should the negotiations proceed well, there is certainly a
                possibility of retaining a majority of those jobs, but this is a
                private, commercial set of transactions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The IDB could well be involved and stands
                ready to assist with the objective of ensuring that there is a
                viable manufacturing unit on that site. As Members are probably
                aware, the product made is cylinder heads for the Ford Motor
                Company, and the particular vehicle or engine for which these
                cylinder heads are being made is enjoying extremely buoyant
                market conditions at present. The potential exists therefore for
                a satisfactory outcome, but I would not wish to mislead the
                House by saying that we could guarantee that all the jobs would
                be secured. It is entirely a matter for the negotiations, but
                the IDB stands ready to assist in achieving the most positive
                outcome possible for that plant.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hay:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for taking time out
                today to answer a number of our questions. There is deep
                uncertainty in the Londonderry area concerning the Campsie site
                and the employment of the 300 workers in that factory. I have
                two questions for the Minister, the first relating to the
                £7·5&nbsp;million grant aid that the company has already
                received. Where has that money come from? The other issue is the
                £139&nbsp;million the company currently owes to creditors. How
                much of that money is owed to creditors in Northern Ireland?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister, who has been very exact
                on the issue raised in the House today. I must remind him,
                however, that the sooner the uncertainty over the company in
                Campsie is brought to an end, the better for the workforce. I
                express my thanks to the Minister and his Department for the
                work they have done in attempting to salvage the company in some
                way.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The hon Member for Foyle will be aware that
                the administrative receivers, Arthur Andersen, are in charge of
                the company. The question of its creditors and how much is owed
                in Northern Ireland are matters exclusively for the
                administrative receivers at this stage. As far as grant aid is
                concerned, quite obviously assistance was forthcoming from the
                Industrial Development Board in the form of selective financial
                assistance to provide for capital equipment and training when
                the subsidiary was established.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member will also be aware that, because
                of the high-tech nature of the processes and the significant
                quantity of automation installed at the time of the project’s
                inception, a great deal of technical difficulties were
                encountered. The workforce was unused to these processes, and,
                indeed, litigation between the company and the suppliers of
                certain equipment is ongoing. The matter is currently before the
                courts, and it is not possible for me to elaborate on that, but
                that shows and demonstrates the depth of the difficulties
                surrounding this particular project. With regard to the total
                number of creditors, the Member will be aware that there is a
                subtext, in that a Department of Trade and Industry
                investigation is currently being conducted by independent
                inspectors into the affairs of Transtec plc, concentrating on
                the accounting treatment of a claim by the Ford Motor Company
                against Transtec.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot prejudge the outcome of that
                investigation as it is sub judice, but Members will see at a
                glance that a significant number of complicated issues surround
                it. As to the need for a positive, satisfactory and early
                outcome, I fully appreciate the difficult situation in which the
                workforce finds itself. That having been said, there is a lot of
                work on the shop floor now. As I said in my original answer, the
                workforce is currently operating under the same terms of
                contract that it had when Transtec was in charge of its affairs.
                So the position of the workforce has not materially changed
                since the administrative receivers were appointed.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can the Minister elaborate on that? This is
                not just about the future of the workforce. Because this company
                is in receivership, those working at the plant have been denied
                mortgages when they have given the address of their employer.
                They are also having other financial difficulties because of
                this.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can sympathise with the position in which
                many workers find themselves. This is not unique, I regret to
                say. I know from local government experience that when people
                are on temporary contracts, mortgage lenders and other finance
                houses take a very sceptical and jaundiced view of them,
                because, not having permanent, guaranteed employment, their
                income stream cannot be guaranteed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The position is only resolvable with
                confirmation that agreement has been reached with a potential
                purchaser. Regrettably, as long as this company remains in
                administrative receivership, I do not see any solution to the
                problem. The basic problem is that mortgage lenders and finance
                houses do not regard people who may currently be earning
                satisfactory wages as being in long-term employment. They will
                not adjust their attitudes until the jobs are confirmed when the
                company passes back into private hands.</p>

                for his comments. Does he envisage a gap between Transtec and
                the new negotiations that he is involved in? Are the jobs that
                he has saved existing jobs, which will not be re-advertised?
                Will the owners employ the existing workforce if the
                negotiations are successful?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not quite understand what the Member
                means by a gap. This is the subject of a private negotiation.
                Since the company went into receivership, those employed on that
                date have had their contracts of employment adopted, on behalf
                of the company, by the administrative receiver. Those who were
                previously working at Transtec have had their contracts adopted
                by the administrative receivers. They remain employees of the
                company and continue to be employed under the same terms as
                before. The administrative receiver is liable for
                post-employment wages and salaries.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The most likely outcome, though I can not
                guarantee it, is that a significant number of employees would be
                retained by the new purchaser, depending on the contract that
                that company may have with the Ford Motor company. This is a
                competitive industry, based on supply and demand, and with more
                than one supplier in the EU. It is most likely that the
                contracts of the existing workforce would be adopted, but I
                cannot give any guarantees as it is a private matter.</p>

                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government should facilitate and support
                the arts and culture but not be interventionist. It is
                imperative that artists, musicians, writers and others feel that
                the Government are there to assist and enable their work, but
                not to dictate on its content or ambition. That is a primary
                principle. A vital element of the success of art and culture has
                to do with the marketing and promotion of the work of writers
                and artists. It is vital that the Government do what they can to
                provide for the industry — related and infrastructural aspects
                of cultural endeavours.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What do we mean when we talk about arts,
                culture and leisure? What is the connection between them? An
                oft-quoted definition of culture is &quot;what people do when
                they do not have to do anything.&quot; Is the answer to fill
                time, to leave something behind, to influence the world, to
                define oneself in any of the many activities which fall within
                the categories of arts, culture and leisure? Clearly economics
                in life is important, but that is not the only, or even the most
                important, dimension.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The other elements, the things we do when we
                do not have to do anything, are what feed the spirit of our
                society and our people. Without them there would be no society
                and, therefore, no economy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a central element of our policy that
                money devoted to these areas is not allotted on the basis of
                patronage or charity, but is a key investment in our future.
                That is the bedrock of the SDLP’s policy in this central area
                of human existence. The pay-off from this investment is not to
                be measured in &quot;across the counter&quot; economic terms but
                in the terms of the growing health of society and in its
                capacity to know itself and to relate to the external world.
                Since we are dealing with Northern Ireland, a central element of
                our approach must be the acceptance that we deal not with a
                single culture but with many different strands of experience,
                bound together for better or worse. A central objective must be
                the reconciliation and integration of these different strands,
                not with a view to blandness, but to maximise the tension of
                creativity as well as the creativity of tension. By using art to
                tell our story we must not admit the unmentionable. If we do so
                we have failed our people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important to define precisely what we
                are talking about. There are two fundamentally opposing views of
                art and culture. One sees the artist sitting high on a hill
                above the people, bestowing works and representations upon the
                many, who are taught not to question. The other approach is
                founded on the belief that each human being, citizen, or
                individual has a capacity for creativity and that together we
                have ownership of this collective imagination. This is the
                democratic view, and it should not surprise anyone that it is
                the view of the SDLP. Art and culture are the vehicles of
                reconciliation between our divided peoples. These fields give
                the greatest opportunity for challenging the prejudices,
                stereotypes and mutual incomprehension which lie at the heart of
                the fear which has gripped this society for generations. We need
                to create symbols and representations of what is common between
                us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As far as the arts and disability are
                concerned, one in six people in Northern Ireland has a
                disability. There is a lack of good training to enable disabled
                artists to become facilitators. More role models are necessary
                with whom disabled people can identify, and facilitating
                workshops is one way of achieving this. At present, people have
                to travel outside the UK to find suitable training. Funding to
                support artists to undertake this training is limited, and
                disabled artists are not even given the same importance as other
                artists when they are applying for funding. At present, there is
                a limited number of disabled artists, approximately 20,
                practising in Northern Ireland, and with regard to arts
                programmes, they tend to be the same people. However, this will
                change if more workshops are offered to disabled groups and day
                centres, although the problem of participation still depends on
                the provision of accessible arts centres. A change of attitude
                towards disabled people is needed by everyone.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is necessary to include disabled people at
                the planning stages of programmes. The best scenario would be to
                have a disabled person on each regional arts committee, acting
                as a voice for the disabled. That would bypass problems of
                access and participation at the planning stage, rather than
                their encountering frustration when the programme begins.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With respect to arts and education, we
                believe that the process of cultural rejuvenation must begin
                with education. The subject of segregated education has been a
                great bugbear in this society for many years, and although there
                has been some movement, there has not been enough.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But perhaps we have been putting the cart
                before the horse. Perhaps, what we need to do is take a leaf out
                of the Good Friday Agreement and approach this issue initially
                within the separate communities. We propose that the preliminary
                stage of the desegregation process should be a presentation, in
                the education system, of the culture of the &quot;other&quot;.
                We believe that it is vital that the youth of each community
                initially be confronted with the culture of the
                &quot;other&quot;, so that curiosity, interest and, ultimately,
                understanding can be created among our young people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We propose a policy of adopting artists in
                residence in each of the three levels of education with a strong
                emphasis on choosing artists from a different tradition, to
                challenge and stretch the perceptions of our young people. This
                might be approached on an experimental basis to begin with but
                with increasing ambition as it develops. Younger children might
                be exposed to the experiment for, say, two weeks per annum in
                primary school, one month at secondary level and, perhaps, up to
                six months at third level.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the matter of financial support for the
                arts, we in the SDLP favour the widest possible support for the
                arts, with particular emphasis on community and minority arts
                endeavours, as well as supporting the existing commitments to
                theatres, galleries and other centres of cultural life. We also
                favour the introduction of an expanded range of tax incentives.
                Although we do not raise our own taxes now, it is to be hoped
                that we will do some time in the near future so that there will
                be funding, allocated from private sources, for the assistance
                and promotion of the arts. Such a measure would greatly assist
                the important work being done by the action business body. It is
                important that the imperative to involve the business community
                in the artistic life of our society be approached from the
                perspective of demonstrating to the entrepreneurial community
                the enormous benefits which can accrue to business from a
                society whose social health is underwritten by a healthy
                cultural life.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the besetting fears of the artistic
                community is the financal insecurity associated with the
                creative life. To give an example, one of the great success
                stories of our neighbours across the border has been the
                introduction of tax exemption schemes for creative artists
                introduced by a former Finance Minister. This visionary proposal
                has not only had the benefit of facilitating the level of
                cultural expresion in Southern society, but has also attracted
                creative artists from all over the world to Ireland, where their
                presence contributes enormously to the culture and economic life
                of that society. We propose the adoption of a similar policy. We
                propose the introduction of an art and architectural tax or
                levy, currently in place in various European countries and the
                United States, to enable local authorities to have funding
                autonomy for cultural projects in their own areas . This would
                work on the basis of a levy of, say, 1% on all public
                developments, which would be used to fund the provision of local
                art works in appropriate local contexts, including such
                developments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another aspect of the cultural life of the
                Irish Republic which we might profitably examine is the story of
                the National Theatre Company, based at the Abbey Theatre in
                Dublin. This theatre, although admittedly patchy, has
                nevertheless provided a showcase, not merely for established and
                emerging writers, but for views of society which might otherwise
                have no means of expression. It has provided a guiding light for
                Southern society’s cultural growth, which is fed into other
                disciplines and media. This is something that we should seek to
                emulate. We should encourage the Lyric Theatre to develop its
                central role in sustaining and developing local artists and
                writers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We might also take a leaf out of the Republic
                of Ireland’s book with regard to supporting the indigenous
                film industry. The Southern policy of strong state support and
                tax incentives has resulted in a spin off for the Irish economy.
                Good films require good stories and top-class writing. We need
                to provide seed capital to enable producers to take the kind of
                risks which are essential if this society is to be provided with
                reflections of itself which match the quality of those produced
                in the rest of Europe and in America.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This should improve dramatically with the
                current £65 million budget available to the Department of
                Culture, Arts and Leisure and should be seen as a one-off boost
                for the infrastructural side of the industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must also build on the achievements of the
                Northern Ireland Film Commission and extend its ability to fund
                and oversee the development of a strong indigenous industry.
                Perhaps it is necessary to develop a more corporate identity and
                modus operandi for this body to enable it to compete in the
                present cut-throat world of international movie making. This
                will not happen unless strenuous efforts are made to upgrade the
                technical infrastructure and provide the highest quality
                personnel. For example, the establishment of a high-tech ultra
                modern digital mastering facility and the training of talented
                people to run such a facility would add enormously to the
                attractiveness of Northern Ireland as a centre of excellence in
                this field.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the last three years productions spent £6
                million in Northern Ireland. This figure will rise as interest
                grows in the natural locations and skilled crew that Northern
                Ireland has to offer a creative film maker.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SDLP believes that much improvement could
                be made by emulating the cultural strategies of our neighbours
                in the Republic. This can be a two-way-street, and we in
                Northern Ireland, as has been demonstrated by so many of our
                writers and artists, have much to offer the Republic given the
                overall image of Irish culture in the eyes of the world. One of
                the most successful examples of cross-border co-operation in the
                field of the arts is the jointly funded Tyrone Guthrie Centre at
                Annaghmakerrig in Co Monaghan. There, artists from both sides of
                the border work alongside one another. We should use that
                example as a model for future developments in this area of arts
                and culture. The guiding symbol of these endeavours should be
                the metaphorical notion of the illusive duck between the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Television and radio are central elements of
                the culture of a modern society. Northern Ireland has been well
                served in some respects by our regional services, but there have
                been significant shortcomings in showcasing local writing on
                both radio and television. The main problem has been the
                centralisation of decision making in London, which has militated
                against the provision of satisfactory representations of this
                society on our airwaves and television screens.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland, treated as a region of the
                United Kingdom, is frequently approached from London in an
                objective manner which limits the self-expression of the true
                voice of this society. Writers, directors and performers
                complain that they are not listened to, that they are told what
                they can and cannot say about their society. We need a genuine
                regional policy which would give autonomy to artists and
                producers to give this society a more truthful and challenging
                idea of who we are and where we are going. We call on the BBC
                and the other providers of these services to look again at their
                policy on drama and other forms of culture with a view to
                encouraging self-confidence and creativity rather than handing
                down prescriptions and diktats.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While there has been an enormous growth in
                community-based theatre in Northern Ireland, there remains a
                suspicion that groups seeking to make particular statements
                about themselves and their lives have found it more difficult
                than others to obtain Government funding and support. Although a
                certain level of quality control is needed, we must develop a
                clear hands-off policy between the support and the content of
                cultural statements.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Language is a central element of culture.
                Clearly, English is the primary mode of expression in this
                society, but there are other tongues which not only have strong
                roots in the traditions of the different communities, but are
                core elements in the identity of those communities right up to
                the present moment. Unfortunately, languages such as Irish and
                Ulster-Scots are taught as foreign languages in Northern
                Ireland. Most people in the North do not encounter Irish in the
                education system until post-primary level, where it is taught in
                the same way as French or German. This practice ensures that
                languages which should be viewed as repositories of cultural
                memory are instead perceived in terms of their economic
                usefulness.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is imperative that a cultural heritage
                programme be established to co-ordinate and focus efforts to
                bring young people in Northern Ireland into contact with the
                vital elements of their culture, including indigenous languages
                and music. In the Republic, Gael&nbsp;Linn has called for the
                appointment of more Irish language teachers in Northern Ireland
                and special language counsellors to assist young people seeking
                to learn Irish, and for the provision of facilities and other
                support to make Irish an attractive choice for students. The
                SDLP supports these proposals with regard to all the indigenous
                languages, and, specifically in the case of Irish, propose
                stronger cross-border contacts between relevant bodies and
                organisations. We should also have a policy of requiring from
                our broadcasters a greater public service commitment to the
                support of minority languages and cultures within our society,
                for example by providing subtitles to drama and current affairs
                programmes, and also by providing such programming in all the
                indigenous languages.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the area of art and culture, the support
                of the contemporary must be combined with the maintenance of
                what has been handed down. A society can only grow culturally if
                it first has a clear notion of where it is coming from. A
                central element of the Government’s function in this area,
                therefore, is the preservation and celebration of the cultural
                artefacts and experiences of the past. In this respect, our
                society has been fortunate, but there is no room for
                complacency. We must invest in a sustained attempt to restore
                archival film footage, manuscripts and other artefacts of our
                past, and provide for this to be done on a continuing basis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having accepted the necessity of separating
                the administration of Government policy on the arts from the
                actual work of artists and writers, it is also important to
                provide a structure in which each layer of the cultural process
                can operate to the maximum possible extent. To this end, we
                recommend the creation of a policy implementation buffer between
                the area of Government policy and that of creativity. The SDLP
                recommends the establishment of a cultural task force to examine
                ways in which the cultural and artistic life of Northern Ireland
                might be galvanised at this critical juncture in our history.
                This task force should be independent of all existing bodies and
                be empowered both to make recommendations centred on expanding
                this society’s creative potential and to identify any factors
                that may be inhibiting the development of the cultural life of
                our people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This body might also be given exceptional
                powers to develop and implement strategic thinking and to target
                available resources so as to develop the industrial potential of
                the cultural domain. The task force should comprise a
                combination of business and commercial experience, working
                artists and those who have been involved in arts administration
                on both sides of the border. Its remit should extend to the
                undertaking of a critical review of how the arts are
                administered in Northern Ireland. The task force would examine
                the effectiveness of existing bodies with responsibility for
                administering and fostering the arts, with a specific brief to
                create improved conditions for promoting the maximum level of
                access to the arts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The present thought paradigm with regard to
                arts and culture might have one believe that its current level
                of Government support — £64&nbsp;million per annum —
                represents a substantial commitment. We beg to differ. If, as
                outlined at the outset of this document, the artistic and
                cultural domain is perceived as central to the life, including
                the economic life, of this society, then this level of funding
                reveals itself as relatively paltry. It will be clear,
                therefore, that what is required is not an incremental
                improvement on the existing commitment to this vital ingredient
                to a full life for our society, but a radical review of our
                whole thinking and approach.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Adamson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to concentrate on language in
                the arts. My background is a Gaelic background in that my
                great-grandmother Lambie spoke nothing but Gaelic on the isle of
                Islay. She taught us well. My Gaelic has since gone away quite a
                bit, but the memories of her have lingered on. For my great-
                grandmother the centre of the Gaelic world was Islay, naturally,
                although the centre of my Gaelic world was Bangor, where I was
                born, because I was interested in the development of Ulster
                Gaelic, rather than other types of Gaelic, particularly
                &quot;Official&quot; Irish. And East Ulster Gaelic was, of
                course, something which I learned a lot about as a boy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also learned a lot about Ulster-Scots,
                which was the language of the neighbourhood around my native
                village of Conlig, and I have followed Ulster-Scots all my life.
                I tried to maintain an interest in the local community in
                Ulster-Scots when I was a young man, but various factors
                militated against that. Ulster-Scots, like its sister language
                of Scots in Scotland, is of course a West-Germanic language. It
                has its own vocabulary, grammar, literary tradition and
                dialectical regions. I first encountered it in written form in
                ‘Galloway Gossip,’ an old book my father brought over from
                Galloway which has various dialects of Scots in it. But
                Ulster-Scots has an eroded integrity and a marginalised status.
                This is, of course, a product of official neglect. However, that
                is not a rationale for ignoring it, as so many do. Ulster-Scots,
                like Irish Gaelic — I use that in the broad sense — has
                contributed to the linguistic diversity of Northern&nbsp;Ireland
                and to our English language literary tradition. However,
                Ulster-Scots, like Irish Gaelic, also deserves a less reactive
                and a more proactive approach to the support of its own language
                and literature.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Special mention, of course, must always be
                made of the place of Robert Burns in the Ulster-Scots literary
                tradition. Like the works of his predecessors, the poetry and
                songs of Burns and Lowland Scots were well known among all the
                Ulster-Scots communities during the late eighteenth&nbsp;century
                and throughout the nineteenth&nbsp;century. These works form a
                valid part of the Ulster-Scots literary tradition, just as
                Ulster-Scots writings were created in the same broader Ulidio-Scottish
                cultural context.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first edition of Burns’s works was
                published in Kilmarnock in 1786, but the second edition was
                published in Belfast in 1787. This interaction remains part of
                the Ulster-Scots tradition. The Belfast Burns club is one of the
                oldest in the world and several other clubs exist in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland. It would be a gross misunderstanding of
                the history of Burns clubs in Northern&nbsp;Ireland to dismiss
                their significance as being only relevant to expatriate Scots
                living in Ulster. I am aware that individual contemporary
                Ulster-Scots writers have regularly had works rejected by local
                publishers on the grounds that there was no market for this type
                of material. So I endorse the Arts Council’s recommendation to
                focus future support on the writers rather than on the
                publishers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also welcome the Arts Council’s positive
                attitude towards community drama. Amateur drama in rural Antrim
                and Down, including productions by Young Farmers Clubs, provide
                some of the last surviving opportunities for some Ulster-Scots
                to be heard in public situations. Many local plays continue to
                be written in the farmhouse kitchen genre, and this is one of
                the liveliest twentieth century Ulster-Scots literary forms. It
                is not unusual for amateur dramatic societies from Ulster-Scots
                speaking areas to ad lib standard English scripts directly into
                Ulster-Scots. Classical drama exists in Scots translation as
                well and opportunities could be exploited by the Arts Council to
                bring Scots language drama productions from Scotland to our
                theatres.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the early 1800s many observers reported
                that the airs and ballads of the Ulster-Scots communities in
                Antrim and Down were merely those that were strictly Scottish.
                The tunes identified by scores of Ulster-Scots folk poets are
                suitable settings for their songs and provide confirmation of
                the overwhelmingly Scottish character of their musical
                repertoire from 1780 onwards. We have a flourishing band
                movement in contemporary Ulster-Scots areas. Much of it is
                grounded in the Ulster-English tradition of mid and south Ulster
                — exceptions to this rule are the Royal Scottish Pipe Band
                Association and the Accordion Band Movement. These musical
                traditions and their instruments remain essentially Ulster-Scots
                in their identities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In recent years the all-Ireland Scottish Pipe
                Band Championships, held in Northern Ireland, have attracted
                tens of thousands to each event. However, little acknowledgement
                is given to the exceptional international achievements of Ulster
                pipers and accordionists. Despite our small numbers, the world
                championships in all grades, including solo prizes, are
                regularly and currently held by people from Northern Ireland. I
                support the proposal by the Pipe Band Movement that support be
                given to its piping and drumming school.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Scottish pipes, along with Lambeg drums,
                remain one of the few genuine traditional music art forms in
                Northern Ireland in that they rarely, if ever, follow written
                music, and they are learnt orally. Solo pipers and fiddlers were
                the traditional accompaniment for country square dances and
                reels over a century ago. Ulster-Scots fiddling and accordion
                playing is still associated with country dancing today.
                Ulster-Scots traditional fiddle music exists, but it is rarely
                played beyond small local groups to small or non-existent
                audiences. It has no recognition beyond the smaller number who
                play in it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The long-established and flourishing branches
                of the Royal Scottish Country Dance Society in Northern Ireland
                receive no funding from the Arts Council. However, they receive
                some limited support from the Sports Council. The inescapable
                conclusion of such a policy appears to be that any non-Irish
                tradition of dance is only a keep-fit exercise. Informal reels
                and country quadrilles also survive as traditional dances
                performed in small groups as a genuine legacy of the
                Ulster-Scots folk dance tradition. These survivals are not part
                of Irish set dancing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The catalogue of denial and marginalisation
                of Ulster-Scots culture in Northern Ireland is too lengthy to be
                properly addressed at this time. However, it needs to be
                addressed by the Arts Council in the context of regular audits
                of evaluation and assessment procedures to ensure that no group
                in Northern Ireland is discriminated against. As stated, the
                issues are complex, and while the description of traditional
                music as either Irish or Orange is simplistic and unhelpful, the
                broader issue of the criteria for funding needs to be addressed
                urgently. Traditional arts are subject to a variety of
                influences including Gaelic, Orange, Irish, English and
                Scottish.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These core traditions of our country deserve
                support in their own right to ensure that the traditional arts
                are not collectively seen as the preserve of any one section of

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Van&nbsp;Morrison, of course, and our
                painters Jack&nbsp;B&nbsp;Yates and John&nbsp;Lavery. Digressing
                momentarily, it was a matter of some regret to myself and others
                that there was an attempt recently to remove history of art as
                an ‘A’ level subject from the curriculum. I am glad that it
                was reinstated in the course of the curriculum review. The
                people I have named have excelled themselves. They have received
                international recognition and have projected a very positive
                image of this country where art knows no boundaries.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is the mission of my party to ensure that
                every citizen of this country can share in its artistic and
                cultural wealth. We want to create a system where arts and
                culture are truly accessible to all Irish people, North and
                South, and particularly to those who have been marginalised in
                the past because of disability, gender, political belief or
                geographical location. That creates quite a challenge for us
                all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any discussion about the arts must touch upon
                the allocation of finite resources both to the creators and to
                the consumers of art. This has always been hotly debated, as
                indeed has the very definition of art itself. I know that the
                European definition of art incorporates culture. We have much
                food for thought on this matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is cuma cé bhéas i mbun riarachán agus
                maoiniú na n-ealaíon, an Arts Council sna sé chondae nó an

                soláthair ag gach leibhéal. Caithfidh ceangal a bheith ann
                fosta le hoideachasóirí le go dtig leis an aos óg páirt
                iomlán a ghlacadh sna healaíona agus sa chultúr. Agus go
                mbeidh grá á chothú don chultúr i measc an aosa óig.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tá an féin-chur in iúl agus an
                chruthaitheacht tábhachtach, don aos óg ach go háirithe.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whoever is responsible for administering or
                funding the arts, whether it be the Arts Council in the Six
                Counties or an Chomhairle Ealaíona in the Twenty-six Counties,
                they need to really appreciate art being created by ordinary
                people and which is relevant to ordinary people. Art should
                interest people and reflect the nature of the society in which
                they live. It will take a mixture of community arts and
                sometimes what are known as local appreciation of fine arts, or
                higher arts. The definitions are always most interesting.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Proper recognition needs to be given to mural
                art and to community drama, which might be described as amateur,
                but only in terms of remuneration, not quality. Those types of
                media enable people to reflect their own experiences and tell
                their stories from their own perspectives. There needs to be
                greater liaison at all levels between the providers of arts and
                culture and arts funders. There needs to be closer contact
                between the educationalists and the arts practitioners so that a
                grá for arts and culture can be properly developed and fostered
                in our young people, because self expression and creativity is
                so crucial for them. Mol an óige agus tiocfaidh sí, mar a
                deirtear.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will concentrate my remaining remarks on
                other priority areas that require some focus. The Irish language
                is one area. It was totally recognised in the Good Friday
                Agreement, and all that we ask for is that that is given
                actuality in terms of public recognition by statutory agencies
                and such bodies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another area requiring focus is in the
                promotion of a wide range of qualitative art forms, both modern
                and traditional — in this matter the revitalisation of
                traditional arts and crafts is very important. We need to
                increasingly recognise emerging and growing all-inclusive
                community arts festivals or féilte and the value of single
                identity work, wherever that may come from, without the need for
                social engineering to suit funding criteria, which is not
                totally natural.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Very importantly, there needs to be a single
                all-Ireland administration for the arts to avoid unnecessary
                duplication of work. There are other areas of public life where
                this would also apply — agriculture, tourism, industrial
                development. We need to learn lessons from the rest of Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McMenamin earlier referred to those areas
                of co-operation which presently exist, and I would like to think
                that Mr McGimpsey would be like Michael D Higgins and that we
                would see a ministerial-led Department — I think that he has
                done good work to date. Michael D Higgins said in relation to
                the arts that the dissenting voice must be heard. Not everybody
                has to be a conformist when it comes to the arts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another area for focus is in putting people
                before buildings sometimes, but not all of the time. The
                National Lottery has been kind to theatres in places such as
                Armagh and Cookstown and these are tremendous assets. However,
                it is important that we consider people as well as buildings,
                and that we provide suitable training courses for budding young
                actors and actresses. People presently have to go to London for
                a suitable course. If they are aged 17 and have a talent for
                acting that is where they invariably will have to go.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to focus on the innovative use of
                existing buildings and facilitating touring theatre groups. I am
                calling for the re-orientation of public money towards these
                areas without huge displacement, and a debate needs to take
                place about that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to look at bringing art to the people
                and seeking new audiences. There are criteria laid down for
                funding. Let us look at who meets those criteria best of all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, television, radio and other forms of
                multi-media are so crucial these days. That was the subject of a
                very interesting recent article by Tom McGurk in ‘The Sunday
                Business Post’. BBC television, in particular, needs to take
                note that the Irish language exists and is thriving, and that
                many of us look to Dublin, and not London, as our capital city.
                That is a fact of life in terms of this society.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairman of the Culture, Arts and Leisure
                Committee (Mr ONeill): </b>I too support the sentiments
                expressed in this debate. While absent from the Chamber I
                listened to the debate, and I welcome the number of ideas that I
                heard and which should be able to be adopted and put to use.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are at a very important stage as far as
                arts and culture are concerned. I agree with Members who said
                they recognised those who contributed to the good past that we
                have had. We have lived through a period of great social
                upheaval, which, in common with other great social upheavals in
                history, has led to self-examination and, as a result, increased
                artistic endeavour and output.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a student I remember being told, in
                impressive terms, that 24,000 books had been written about the
                reasons for the outbreak of the First World War. The
                examinations of the causes of the troubles in Northern Ireland
                must be getting close to that, but there is something in the
                literature that has been produced that recognises artistic
                output as a result of self-examination.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Madam Deputy Speaker [Ms Morrice] in the

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are at the stage where we now have the
                potential to move forward. Of all the things that we have done,
                the creation of the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure has
                been one of the most positive and exciting things. The members
                of the Committee and I were enthralled — and I use that word
                carefully — when we met the permanent secretary, Aideen
                McGinley, and her representatives. The excitement, the clear
                enthusiasm, the recognition of the challenges and the openness
                to suggestion that were coming from the team filled all of the
                members of the Committee with hope for the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Arts, museums and all of the other areas that
                go to make up the broad brief of the Department of Culture, Arts
                and Leisure were, in the past, the lesser-funded elements of
                larger Departments, and they did not receive the attention or
                encouragement they deserved. They came low in the pecking order.
                Now they are in a Department of their own, with a permanent
                secretary of their own and a Minister of their own who — if I
                may agree with others — has, so far, impressed the Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I make no bones about saying that publicly.
                The excitement and the enthusiasm displayed by the Department
                will make an impact.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I said, we are at the edge, and I think of
                it as the edge of a renaissance in culture, arts and leisure in
                Northern Ireland. We can spearhead that renaissance through the
                Assembly, the Committee and the Department working together to
                create that open and transparent approach to the whole of arts
                and culture that I think we would all welcome.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When people talk about the arts they
                immediately begin to think of cutting up a cake and
                redistributing it in certain ways. Unfortunately, as we have
                discovered, the cake is very small. The reason for that is what
                has been happening over this last five to 10 years. There has
                been no increase in funding in the Department, not even to take
                account of inflation. That has been a debt on all areas in the
                Department, and it will take a considerable readjustment to
                bring it back even to a fair basis on which we could operate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of the items in Mr&nbsp;McMenamin’s
                document are worth examining. I am not necessarily saying that
                we should adopt all of them, but they are the types of things we
                should be looking at in terms of funding. We should be looking
                at more private funding for the arts. There are untapped
                possibilities in that area. We should be looking at the
                possibility of convincing central Government — as it happens,
                we have not got control over taxation — to have some kind of
                exemption or reduction for arts activity and artists in Northern
                Ireland. It would not be unlike the regime that was introduced
                so successfully in the Republic some years ago.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another very interesting idea, which comes
                from Europe, is that there should be some kind of tax — dare I
                use that word — or some kind of contribution from developers
                towards a local council arts budget. The figure currently used
                is 1% of development costs — quite a lot when you think about
                it. It has proved to be a successful way of gathering money for
                the arts in some European countries. If we had applied that in
                the Belfast City Council area — when you think of all of the
                development that has taken place there over the last few years
                — we would have a thriving budget for investment in the arts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These types of ideas are worth examining. We
                may not agree to adopt them or go with them, but certainly they
                represent the type of thing we should be doing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, when our civilisation is judged, and
                if at that stage we have spent money only on functional things
                and the things that we need to live on, if we have spent nothing
                on the creative, nothing for the soul, nothing for the
                aesthetic, and nothing for arts and culture, then we will be
                judged very poorly indeed.</p>

                Ulster-Scots aspect of the arts in Northern Ireland. The term
                &quot;arts&quot; takes in a wide range of different cultural
                events and activities, from art to music, from dance to plays
                and books. The importance of culture must continually be
                highlighted, and an increased awareness of one’s culture can
                serve to benefit young and old alike. However, it is important
                that one cultural identity in Northern Ireland is not emphasised
                while another community’s culture is ostracised or neglected.

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Herbison believed that this was because there
                was a tendency to see only two traditions in Northern Ireland
                instead of examining the rich variety of cultural traditions
                among the Ulster Protestants.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is now important that we mainstream the
                wide diversity of culture and cultural identity instead of
                seeing this as a debate of two sides. For this reason, in the
                short time I have left to speak, I wish to concentrate on the
                Ulster-Scots language, to give a brief history and to look at
                developments in this area in recent years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ian Adamson has already said something of
                Ulster-Scots, clearly outlining how it has developed and its
                importance to many of us in this Province. All those who have
                spoken on the subject thus far have said that language is
                important. Language is often unique to a particular group or
                place, and it often carries with it a rich cultural history.
                Language has always been seen as a mark of identity, and the
                language debate has particular significance in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Northern Ireland there are a number of
                distinct traditions and nationalities — the Irish, the Ulster
                Scots and the Ulster English. In addition, we have a number of
                diverse cultural identities such as the Chinese and Indian
                communities. One of the most significant literary works on the
                cultural significance of language is a play by the well-known
                playwright, Brian&nbsp;Friel, entitled ‘Translations’. It
                deals with the transitional period in Ireland when place names
                were changed from Irish to English. However, its deeper theme is
                the importance of language and identity. Brian Friel admits what
                many in this House who speak Irish fail to, namely that language
                can be an emotive political issue and not a purely cultural
                matter. The issue of language has always been emotive in
                Ireland, both North and South, because of the political
                connotations which the debate carries.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I feel that Ulster-Scots is not a
                political point-scoring exercise, but rather an expression of
                people’s need and desire to find out who they are and where
                they come from, and many Members already know that. The
                Ulster-Scots cultural identify has been ignored for many years
                and scoffed at by many who openly dismiss their own linguistic
                culture as a dialect. Those who say this only show their
                cultural ignorance by expressing such an opinion. The linguistic
                division between Ulster and the rest of the island predates even
                the plantation. However, the present pattern of linguistic
                division is a product of the settlement of Ulster during the
                seventeenth century. Over this period these linguistic
                influences, most notably the Teutonic and Old Norse strands and
                the influx of Lowland Scots into Ulster, led to the evolution of
                Ulster-Scots speech unique to the north-east of Ireland. I
                should perhaps mention that it went across Northern Ireland to
                Donegal and eventually to the new lands of America and Canada as
                well.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ivan&nbsp;Herbison states that the language
                possessed many of the distinguishing characteristics of a
                separate national language rather than those of a mere regional
                dialect, not only in pronunciation, but also in orthography,
                vocabulary and syntax.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ulster-Scots is not only important for its
                complex historical development, but it is also important
                culturally because it has its own literary tradition. Between
                1750 and 1850 some 60 to 70&nbsp;volumes of poetry were printed
                which belonged to the Ulster-Scots literary tradition of the
                rhyming weavers, the poets who came from a rural working class
                background and who were the descendants of Scottish settlers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope, in some small way, that the great
                cultural wealth in Ulster-Scots has been explained today, and
                connected directly to the Ulster-Scots language. Some people in
                this Chamber self-righteously declare themselves to be full
                supporters of cross-community work and events. However, it is
                clear to me and to many others that those people believe that
                the Irish identity and culture should be accepted by all as
                cultural rather than political, and the cultural identity of
                Ulster Protestants should be suppressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nationalists want Irish traditional music
                bands and Irish dancing to be accepted by all as non-political
                symbols of culture, while they simultaneously try to suppress
                every element of Ulster Protestant culture, including the very
                organisation which was set up to defend Ulster Protestant
                culture — the Orange Order. There is no difference in displays
                of culture. An Irish dancer is as much a symbol of one tradition
                as a flute band or an Orange procession is a symbol of another.
                Yet Nationalists will not even tolerate the thought of Orangemen
                walking or of faintly hearing the sound of a band. Indeed, some
                people go out of their way, some travel miles upon miles, just
                to be offended.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is time for Nationalists to take a look at
                their own hypocritical policies on culture and become mature
                enough to accept the culture of all sections of this community
                because we are not going away either. It is time for
                Nationalists to accept that there are many elements of Ulster
                Protestant culture which are rich and beautiful. We should be,
                and indeed we are, proud of our cultural heritage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For many years, propaganda machines have been
                trying to show that Ulster Protestant culture is bigoted and
                that it is a pale imitation of Irish culture. It is now time for
                the true picture to be shown: that of the diversity of
                identities and cultures. Some work has already been done to
                promote the Ulster-Scots language and traditions. It is valuable
                for all traditions to learn about this unique element of
                Northern Ireland’s culture. The only way for Northern Ireland
                to move forward is for everyone to be tolerant of each other and
                each other’s differing cultures and identities. It is possible
                to be proud of your own identity, yet respect the richness of
                someone else’s, and I believe it is time that those
                propagating the Irish language’s viewpoint open wide their
                somewhat narrow minds and see some good in the culture of other
                traditions in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, Nationalists will have to accept
                that language can be emotive and offending, especially when used
                as part of a political points-scoring exercise. That has been
                demonstrated in this House by some of those who insist on using
                the Irish language when they plainly cannot speak it, using it
                merely to cause offence. Language does not cause offence when
                used in a cultural context by those genuinely interested in the
                language, but it does when it is used as part of a political
                points-scoring exercise.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, I would simply state that
                equality must be given to all cultural traditions, instead of
                the scoffing and intolerance shown by some across this Chamber
                to all elements of Ulster Protestant and Ulster-Scots culture.</p>

                for the optimum use of public funding in the sphere of culture,
                arts and leisure in Northern Ireland. There is, for example, the
                report on the recent FutureSearch conference, which was
                organised by the permanent secretary to the Department of
                Culture, Arts and Leisure. That document should provide a number
                of useful ideas in creating a strategic framework for action in
                arts and culture in Northern Ireland over the next
                20&nbsp;years. We have also seen published in recent times a
                strategy review for the Arts Council in Northern Ireland
                entitled ‘Opening up the Arts’.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The aim is to have a new Arts Council
                strategy in place by April&nbsp;2001. This review makes

                community arts budget. The review says</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the rapid growth of community arts in
                recent years has not been accompanied by adequate
                evaluation.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No doubt the Minister for Culture, Arts and
                Leisure, who has graced us with his presence today, and his
                officials are taking note of this and the many other valid
                points in the Arts Council’s review.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Community arts are playing an even greater
                role in reconciliation, and that is to be welcomed and
                encouraged. There is a group in my area called Bright Sparks,
                with whom I am very proud to have associations. It comes from
                Portaferry and caters for youngsters from the age of three. That
                group puts on wonderful shows that could be the pride of
                Northern Ireland. Unfortunately, probably through lack of
                funding, it is confined to the Strangford constituency. There
                are many such community groups.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be remiss of me not to plug another
                very important organisation called Cinemagic. Members may well
                know of the activities of this group and what it does for the
                young film-makers of Northern&nbsp;Ireland. I have to pay
                tribute to one of its directors — my niece, Miss&nbsp;Shona&nbsp;McCarthy.
                I am proud to tell the Chamber about Cinemagic’s activities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many interesting ideas are being generated
                about funding for the arts. The point that I would like to make
                is to do with organisational structures. Public funding of the
                arts is not only a matter for the Arts Council; many other
                bodies including the National Lottery, district councils,
                European institutions and other Government Departments —
                notably Education — are involved as well. Already those hoping
                to benefit from the system find it amazingly complex. My plea to
                the Minister — and I am sure that my colleagues on the
                Culture, Arts and Leisure Committee will support me on this —
                is that special efforts be made to keep the design of any future
                restructuring as simple as possible and the cost of bureaucracy
                as low as possible. We do not want to find that efforts to
                increase funding are rewarded only by increased administrative
                costs, with no significant benefit to Northern Ireland citizens.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, the arts in Northern Ireland
                play a very important role in bringing people together. It is
                vital that we support every effort to bring the arts to an even
                greater number of people and that can only be done by properly
                funding every aspect of the arts, culture and leisure programme.
                I hope that the Minister takes on board all that has been said
                about this today.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Weir:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I had not originally intended to speak in
                this debate, so I will keep my remarks brief. As a former
                culture, arts and leisure spokesman for the Ulster Unionist
                Party, albeit for a period of four&nbsp;days — perhaps the
                shortest-lived party spokesman ever — I feel compelled to say
                something on the subject.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are few subjects which should unite the
                House more than the arts. It is a subject which touches the
                hearts of everybody, whether Members of this House or the
                general public. They may have a love of the cinema, literature
                or fine paintings in an art gallery; they may have a love of
                traditional or country and western music, or they may want to
                buy the latest Blur Lightning Seeds CD. This is an important
                subject, and we have to look at what the guiding principles
                should be when dealing with it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first guiding principle should be that we
                approach this subject with a degree of realism. In the past,
                because culture, arts and leisure have tended to be Cinderella
                aspects of Government which have been hived off to various
                Departments, they have often been susceptible to Government
                cutbacks. We have to realise that the pressure for an increase
                in resources for the arts is going to be met with a great deal
                of resistance, given the scarcity of resources in the future,
                and we are always going to be faced with this situation. If, for
                example, we get additional money, will that money be spent on a
                particular arts project, or is it going to be spent on health or
                education?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There will always be worthy causes which, on
                many occasions, are going to have a greater call on our
                resources than the arts, so it is important that we realise that
                whatever money is spent on the arts — or, indeed, if we are
                able to get any increase in spending on the arts — it will not
                be a vast amount or a vast increase. While I agree with Mr
                McMenamin that we ought to ensure that the individual artist has
                freedom of expression and that interference does not occur, as a
                body we have to ensure that the money we spend on the arts is
                carefully monitored to ensure that we gain the maximum value for
                money from public investment in the arts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second issue that has been highlighted by
                Mr McMenamin is that when looking at spending in the arts, we
                have got to do so in an imaginative context. He mentioned the
                great efforts that have been made in the Republic of Ireland and
                other places in the world. New York is one of the areas which
                has tended to benefit from this. A great deal of emphasis has
                been placed there on trying to attract film-makers and backing
                its local film industry. We have seen in the Republic of
                Ireland, for example, how that has paid dividends, both in an
                artistic sense, in terms of expanding the film industry and
                expanding the artistic content in the Republic of Ireland, and
                also from an economic point of view. For example, in recent
                years a film which is more associated with Scotland, ‘Braveheart’,
                was shot on location in the Republic of Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With the advent of the ceasefires there has
                been an increased interest in Northern Ireland from a cinematic
                point of view, and perhaps film-makers feel that it is more
                accessible. We need to look imaginatively at how we can promote
                the arts in such a way as to benefit the people of Northern
                Ireland, both in terms of enriching their artistic experience
                and also the practical benefit that could bring to the economy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, as a number of Members have
                mentioned, we have to promote cultural diversity. The point has
                been made — and it is a very true one — that culture,
                particularly in the Ulster-British sense and also, to some
                extent, the Ulster-Scots sense, has tended to be marginalised
                and ignored in the past. I would very much hold to that view.
                This has not simply been because of a lack of recognition from
                official sources. At times in the past the Unionist community
                has perhaps not been aware of its own culture; it has perhaps
                not gone out to embrace its culture and history.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that that diversity is
                celebrated. One thing slightly disappointed me about this
                debate, and I am glad to see at least that Jim Shannon was the
                first person to mention it. When we have been looking at arts
                and culture in Northern&nbsp;Ireland, there has obviously been
                much concentration on Irish, the Irish culture, the
                Ulster/British culture and, indeed, on Ulster-Scots. Jim Shannon
                has been the only Member so far to mention that we are living in
                a multicultural society and to highlight that there are more
                than just the British and the Irish communities in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland. There is a wide range of communities —
                for example, Chinese, Indian and Jewish — and it is important
                that, as part of that feeling of cultural diversity, we ensure
                that those communities are well represented as well. The
                artistic diversity which they can bring to Northern&nbsp;Ireland
                should be celebrated. That would be enriching for the whole of
                society and help to break down some of the barriers within it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, we should ensure that we have not
                only cultural diversity, but cultural tolerance. And in
                celebrating the various cultures here, we should do so in a
                fashion that does not become — and I have seen this happening
                on a number of occasions — cultural imperialism. From my own
                background, for example, having spent a lot of time at Queen’s,
                I know the very negative effect that the Irish language signs
                there had on the Unionist community. That was a feeling of
                cultural imperialism. Whatever the intentions behind the signs
                — and I am sure that many of the people who supported them did
                so for the best of reasons — it created a feeling of
                oppression and of cultural imperialism. When any section of the
                community feels a sense of cultural imperialism, that leads,
                unfortunately, not to cultural tolerance, but to cultural and
                artistic intolerance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must encourage people to celebrate the
                diversity of our culture but to do so in a way in which they do
                not feel that a particular culture is being forced down their
                throats, or feel that they are being forced to learn a language,
                for example, Irish, against their wishes. We must encourage
                tolerance and diversity but ensure that it does not stray into
                the realms of imperialism.</p>

                I watched a Billy Connolly special on late night television,
                very irreverent, very funny and very perceptive. I can imagine
                Billy Connolly talking about arts and culture. &quot;Crawford,

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To some, culture is high culture: concerts
                and theatre, art galleries, poetry and, of course, eating out.
                Everything else is not culture; it is common: television, bingo,
                football, discos, lotteries and carrys-out — or carry-outs. <i>[Laughter]</i>
                I am being too grammatical for myself.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If that is your idea of culture, arts and
                leisure, you might be right in thinking that it is not nearly as
                important as other areas of Government, such as health, housing,
                education, environment and employment. But you would be wrong.
                As that cultural guru Jimmy Cricket says, &quot;There’s
                more.&quot; We are getting very sophisticated. Now we also have
                Cultural Heritage. It has capital letters because it is very
                important, particularly as a way of killing time, and other
                things, during the long, hot Ulster summer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is Cultural Heritage A, full of flags
                and emblems, arches and murals and banners, collarettes and hard
                hats, walking up and down, Ulster-Scots, balaclavas and black
                helmets. There is Cultural Heritage B, full of flags and
                emblems, murals and protests, diddly-dee music and dancing from
                the knees down, tír gan teanga, tír gan anam berets and black
                glasses.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I make the point very firmly that I have no
                wish to belittle the culture of any group. What I am trying,
                awkwardly, to do is to describe each group’s culture from the
                perspective of the other. What I find totally abhorrent is
                Cultural Heritage C, which unites and divides at the same time.
                It is a culture of bigotry and sectarianism, violence and
                punishment, up to and including the ultimate sanction of death.
                This sanction can be directed against one’s own side for not
                conforming, or against the other side just for being different
                and therefore a threat.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Actually, the Member and I conspired to allow
                me to contribute to a debate which I was not listed to take part
                in. His point is very important. He spoke about balaclavas,
                sashes and the like. I have a unique experience of arts and
                culture in Northern Ireland. At school, I had a wonderful
                teacher called Sean&nbsp;Hollywood who introduced me to the
                dramatic arts and the amateur drama circuit. He inspired an
                understanding of what amateur drama can do: the potency of drama
                as a means of communication, a manner of understanding the point
                of view of others, and a way of building empathy between people
                with differing cultural backgrounds and experiences, of building
                sympathy, and through that, unity between people from different
                backgrounds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad that the Minister of Culture, Arts
                and Leisure is here, for I have a simple plea, and I take this
                opportunity to make it to him. The amateur drama circuit in
                Northern Ireland has been the single continuous arena in which
                people from a broad range of backgrounds and beliefs have met,
                exchanged views, communicated and come to some understandings. I
                welcome the current generation of Newpoint Players, who are here
                in the Gallery today. Within that group, and within all the
                groups on the Ulster drama circuit, there is a diverse range of
                religious, political and other views, yet they have found a
                forum in which they can exchange them and come to terms with
                them. It is the single element of arts and leisure in Northern
                Ireland that is wholly underfunded, with no structural supports
                whatsoever, and it is maintained by a massive voluntary effort.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask the Minister to take a personal
                interest in the amateur drama circuit and see what provision he
                can make, or what resources he can release, to help support the
                work of people in every section of the community in Northern
                Ireland.</p>

                I see my councillor colleague from another life, Mr&nbsp;McMenamin,
                looking at me and wondering what I am going to say. Mr A Doherty
                talked about high culture and low culture. Is it not amazing
                that what some people would call low culture — whether it be
                John Hogan or Billy Connolly or whatever — seems to be
                financially viable, whereas what is called high culture often
                needs the public purse to assist it?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr A Doherty:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My answer to that is yes. I thank the first
                person for intervening — he managed to get more time than I am
                going to need. But it was in a good cause, and I am grateful for
                that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The people of most countries take a genuine
                pride in their culture and heritage, no matter how diverse it
                is. It draws them together and brings joy and colour to their
                lives. That is not the case with us, and that is tragic. Now
                tell me that culture, arts and leisure is not important. Now
                tell me it is not time we caught ourselves on and stopped
                tub-thumping or hurling clichés or veiled insults at one
                another and demanding equality so long as we, in Orwellian
                terms, are more equal than others.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Do not tell me that all cultures and
                traditions are good and must be protected, no matter what the
                cost in human suffering, misery and terror. Cannibalism, slavery
                and ritual mutilation of young girls and boys, torturing,
                burning of witches and heretics are all examples of traditions
                and cultural heritage which, thankfully, have now gone in most
                places — sadly, not all. We could all make a long list of
                elements of our culture and traditions that should be changed or
                done away with. There is much that is good that could unite us
                and bring us joy, but there should be no place for anything
                divisive, dangerous or downright evil. The Minister of Culture,
                Arts and Leisure, his Department and the Assembly Committee have
                much to do, and I wish them well.</p>

                I am grateful to Mr McMenamin for raising this subject. I
                believe the arts can be and should be a unifying medium. It can
                break down class, religious and cultural barriers, and that is
                what I hope we in the Culture, Arts and Leisure Committee will
                be directing our attention to over the years. The Culture, Arts
                and Leisure Committee is currently conducting an inquiry into
                fishing. As I listen to members of the angling fraternity
                telling the inquiry about various aspects of fishing that I knew
                little or nothing about, I now appreciate that angling is,
                indeed, an art, and it should be encouraged.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The island of Ireland is rich in all aspects
                of arts and culture, and it is a fundamental part of our
                historical heritage as Celts. We can point to our ancient Celtic
                heritage, which is aptly illustrated and internationally famous,
                and it has been an inspiration to all. Countless artists,
                painters, writers, musicians and architects take inspiration
                from that ancient civilisation known as the Celts. We can
                dispute whether we are Celts or not, but I do not think any of
                us can claim we are purely this or purely that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, we can point to the heritage that
                has been left to us. We can point to the Book of Kells and the
                Book of Durrow. We can look at our Celtic stonework crosses
                throughout the graveyards. We can read the literature of our
                bards and poets. I am indebted to a writer, Thomas&nbsp;Cahill
                — I think he is American — who claims in a book that we
                Celts or Irish saved civilisation from the worst, or darkest,
                excesses of the Middle Ages, and that we did this through the
                medium of art.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore I believe that art is humanity’s
                creative expression and interpretation in a world made by God.
                Art in its most basic form is created by, and should be for, the
                common people, be it through the medium of song, storytelling,
                drama, language, the visual arts, sculpture, or painting and
                drawing. Indeed, in contemporary society, art is used on the
                walls of our various cities and towns to express what the people
                needed to say and, perhaps, were prohibited from saying.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Art should never be interpreted in its
                narrowest forms as a means of class division, or of division of
                any description. Equality should be the cornerstone in the
                thinking of all those charged with the responsibility of
                promoting arts as the means of addressing division and promoting
                diversity. Art, as we know it here, should reflect the ethos of
                the Good Friday Agreement. The Ulster-Scots tradition and the
                interplay and relationship between these two islands as
                reflected in that very rich culture of Scots Gaelic — song,
                Scots dancing, design of clothing — should all be respected
                and promoted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to democratise arts. On all sides of
                the artistic process there needs to be access for the creators
                and also for the consumers at a community level. It should not
                be the prerogative of the affluent. We must recognise that art
                is a partnership that provides a forum for the expression of
                people’s most fundamental needs. It can be utilised to address
                issues that define the social, political and cultural needs of
                the community. I am reminded of an Italian film director, Armand
                Gatti, who came here some 20&nbsp;years ago to make a film which
                he thought would tell everyone in France and Italy what we were
                doing, what sort of a divided people we were. He called it ‘The
                Writing on the Wall’, and he showed the film in France, in
                Toulouse, with French subtitles. Then he showed the film in
                London, and people could not understand what we were saying,
                because we were speaking, I believe, a language that has been
                interwoven with various dialects, from Scots to the Irish
                language. And so, in London, Armand&nbsp;Gatti had to add
                English subtitles to a film in which young people from Derry and
                Belfast were speaking.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also reminded of my mother, who
                travelled quite extensively back and forth between Donegal and
                Scotland. She was a great fan of Robbie&nbsp;Burns. I always
                remember that she quoted or read extensively to us children from
                his poetry. The one that sticks in my mind is</p>

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I think that everyone knows that one. To me,
                all those things make up an interpretation of art. I am thinking
                of interpretation of the Féile an Phobail in West Belfast,
                which has been an artistic festival of tremendous international
                dimensions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has attracted thousands of visitors from
                all over the world in the past two years, proving that art can
                play a fundamental role in bringing people here to enjoy our
                rich and diverse culture, in promoting our economy and in being
                a tourist magnet.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a society we need to do a number of things
                to promote and widen the interpretation of what art is. I think
                that to a degree — some Members have already mentioned this
                — art has been defined for us. Now we need to start to define
                it for ourselves. Art should never be about rich millionaires
                who come over here and buy our paintings, literature, even our
                buildings and export them somewhere in the world because they
                have the means to do so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to start encouraging art by
                encouraging it in our children. We need to look at the wholeness
                of our children. Children are naturally creative. They are
                naturally conduits for the expression of art. We must begin at
                that fundamental level.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Culture, Arts and Leisure Committee needs
                to promote and widen the interpretation of art, and we can do
                this by allowing art to influence us in all forms: art in
                schools; art in community schemes; art for the disabled; art for
                the ethnic and minority communities — we can learn a lot from
                the richness and the diversity of them all. We should look at
                art in our design and textile industry. I used to make Irish
                dance costumes when I was a member of a women’s co-operative.
                We embroidered very elaborate designs, most of them copied from
                the book of Kells. We learned that the knots, crosses, twists
                and designs that we used had an artistic meaning, often
                symbolising something close to nature — for example, the knot
                symbolised harvest time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has to be a radical overhaul of the
                various agencies charged with responsibility for promoting the
                arts. Art must be made more accessible to those communities who
                have struggled for years with little or no financial support, or
                even recognition. We need, once again, to promote and encourage
                all of our cultural festivals, our feiseanna and our films. Look
                at the success of a film made in Derry on a very, very low
                budget, ‘Dance Lexy Dance’. It is an amazing film which made
                it all the way to Los Angeles and the Academy awards.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This has been a valuable debate, and I hope
                that the Culture, Arts and Leisure Committee will address all
                the issues raised today. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Boyd:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want specifically to highlight the
                excellent work of the Northern Ireland Film Commission and
                provide some details of its role and function. The purpose of
                the Northern Ireland Film Commission is to develop the film
                industry and film culture in Northern Ireland. It was
                established in 1997 and provides assistance and information for
                film and television producers from across the world who are
                considering filming in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland has unique opportunities for
                the creative producer. Its position as a region of the United
                Kingdom offers producers access to UK sources of production
                finance, whether for feature films or for television drama. The
                role of the commission is to provide strategic leadership for
                the film sector by ensuring the best use of those public funds
                which are available for film development and production in
                Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, it is contracted by the Arts
                Council of Northern Ireland to provide advice on the
                distribution of National Lottery funds to film projects —
                currently around £700,000 per year. Benefits of the Northern
                Ireland Film Council’s work include medium-and long-term job
                creation, inward investment and tourism. It promotes Northern
                Ireland as a tourist destination, stimulates private-sector
                investment and builds confidence in Northern Ireland through new
                images across screens throughout the world.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Northern Ireland Film Commission promotes
                an awareness of Northern Ireland locations, crews and facilities
                to producers nationally and internationally, and promotes films
                produced in Northern Ireland. It also supports the development
                and production of films in Northern Ireland and encourages
                private-sector investment in the industry. It offers development
                loans to producers intending to make feature films or television
                dramas in the region, and the fund offers producers loans
                towards the costs of developing a project.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Northern Ireland Film Commission provides
                a comprehensive information service in print and digitally on
                all aspects of film in Northern Ireland and Europe.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is recognised as the industry training
                body for Northern Ireland, and, as such, it ensures that the
                training needs of the industry in Northern Ireland are met and
                that producers engage local trainees when appropriate.
                Specialist short courses, training grants for freelance
                technicians, industry-recognised qualifications and support for
                trainees on productions are all part of the commission’s
                commitment to building on the existing creative and technical
                skills and talent base of the industry in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The commission’s training programme is
                supported by Skill Set, the UK national training organisation
                for broadcast, film and video, the Training and Employment
                Agency, and Ulster Television. In 1997, together with Ulster
                Television, in recognition of the success of its joint training
                programme, the commission received a regional training award and
                a national training award.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The commission also works in conjunction with
                BBC Northern Ireland, British Screen, Ulster Television, Channel
                4, Belfast City Council, Londonderry City Council and the Arts
                Council of Northern Ireland on a range of schemes intended to
                develop the creative, technical and business skills essential to
                the growth of the industry in Northern Ireland. The film
                commission manages the premiere scheme, funded in partnership
                with Ulster Television, Belfast City Council and British Screen.
                Premiere offers an opportunity for Northern Ireland’s new
                film-making talent to make five short fiction films each year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland has developed a reputation
                for innovative and imaginative approaches to cinema exhibition
                and media education. The commission promotes the development of
                cultural cinema and encourages the study of the moving image and
                convergent technologies here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland is the home of the Cinemagic
                International Film Festival for Young People. This is a
                high-quality mix of entertainment and education for young people
                between the ages of six and 18.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Belfast is the home of one of the UK’s
                longest established art-house cinemas: the Queen’s Film
                Theatre. Northern Ireland continues to produce many fine actors
                and actresses, and long may that continue. I commend the work of
                the Northern Ireland Film Commission.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, may I say a few words about amateur
                dramatics. This has been thriving in Northern Ireland, and, in
                fact, my own family has been involved in amateur dramatics. I
                thought it was particularly sad when the Arts Theatre closed its
                doors last year. We must ensure, as an Assembly, that no other
                theatres close due to a lack of funding.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Davis:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will be very brief. I am very pleased at
                the way that this debate has taken place and at the number of
                speakers that have taken part. I am delighted to see the
                Minister here. I believe that as a result of the establishment
                of this new Department under a local Minister, the arts, leisure
                and sport will be very dominant in the years that lie ahead.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a well-known fact that Belfast suffered
                for nearly two centuries from having the image, if not the
                explicit reputation, of being the centre of obscurity in western
                Europe, and not without just cause, in relation to the arts.
                However, that has all changed. We are currently well served,
                perhaps better served, for poets, writers, painters, playwrights
                and musicians than any other area of a similar size in the world
                of art. Belfast City Council deserves credit for bringing arts
                to the fore, albeit in response to pressure from various areas
                and groups.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those interested in art in other areas of the
                Province have now organised considerable lobbies to pressurise
                elected representatives for more funds for promotion of the
                arts. We all know that there are plenty of projects throughout
                the Province crying out for more funding and financial support.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We could take a lead from the cities of
                Glasgow and Edinburgh, which have been doing very well in recent
                years. These cities spend not only to promote the arts by
                raising the general level of appreciation but, more importantly,
                by creating new jobs and new industry in what is now established
                as the growth area of the national economy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, I do not believe that we can
                afford to miss the opportunity that now exists, and with the new
                Minister installed in the new Department, we can get on with
                promoting the arts.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure
                (Mr&nbsp;McGimpsey): </b>This has been a wide-ranging debate and
                one that has stimulated a number of people to speak. I am very
                grateful for the input from all parties around the Chamber.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The debate could perhaps have begun with what
                we mean by &quot;culture&quot; and what we mean by
                &quot;arts&quot; — &quot;leisure&quot; is well defined as
                &quot;sporting activities&quot; — since culture and arts are
                sometimes confused. The widest definition of culture is the
                values and rules that underpin society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion is about arts in Northern Ireland,
                and I believe that that relates primarily to the performing
                arts, creative arts and community arts. Those are broken down
                into other facets: painting, sculpture, film, architecture,
                literature, dance, drama, music, poetry, literature, and so on.
                I will not go through the complete list.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The timing of this debate could not be more
                appropriate. Ours is a new Department and we have begun to
                create a strategy for the Department and, within the arts
                section of the Department, a strategy for arts that we call
                &quot;Future Search&quot;, as previously mentioned. The main
                deliverer of financial support for arts in Northern Ireland is
                the Arts Council. A review of the Arts Council, which is now in
                the public domain, has just been published by Prof&nbsp;Everitt.
                It is called the ‘Opening up the arts — a strategy review
                for the Arts Council of Northern Ireland’. It is important
                that we look at those two pieces of work, which have yet to come
                to fruition because the final strategy has still to be produced.
                However, I expect that to happen sooner rather than later.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We recognise the importance of the arts, and
                we recognise the unfulfilled potential and the need to develop
                them. Mr&nbsp;Arthur&nbsp;Doherty referred to arts in terms to
                do with the quality of life, and I believe very strongly in
                that. This is an area that will enhance, reinforce and sustain
                the quality of life for our people by helping to build a better
                future for Northern Ireland through arts and creativity. It will
                also act as a catalyst for personal, social and economic
                development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Someone spoke about value for money, and the
                arts give value for money. In terms of where art stands, the
                Myerscough Report — which came out in 1996 using data from
                1993-94 — demonstrated that six years ago the arts sector had
                a turnover of £150&nbsp;million and supported up to 9,000 jobs.
                When one considers that that was six years ago, and thinks of
                all that has happened since then, one can see the economic
                potential that arts and culture have.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The arts can also be a catalyst for personal
                and social development that gives confidence to young people
                through participation, and they can express an image both within
                and outside Northern Ireland that can change perceptions about
                the Province. They are important among a whole range of
                Government activities and can help to attract inward investment
                and tourism.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is the key element of the
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland economy and that is why it is so exciting.
                A number of points have been raised, and many of those have been
                earmarked for future research.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;McElduff raised the issue of arts in
                education, and that is one top-of-the-list key aim, in terms of
                future research. Mr&nbsp;McElduff played an important role by
                participating in the ‘Creativity in Education’ workshop.
                That workshop looked at how we could give our children the
                opportunity to realise and develop their creative potential —
                embedding creativity in the educational process. Prof
                Ken&nbsp;Robinson, the United Kingdom’s leading authority on
                promoting creativity in education, will be helping us to develop
                action in this area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;McCarthy referred to the creative
                industries. Again, we have enormous potential and talent in this
                area. Coincidentally, it may interest Mr&nbsp;McCarthy to know
                that, during the first period of devolution, the very first
                activity I undertook as Minister was to go to a Cinemagic
                function, and I was very impressed by the director, Miss&nbsp;Shona&nbsp;McCarthy.
                I did not realise that she was his niece, and I do not believe
                she volunteered the information. Even now that I know this, I
                can assure him it will not be a disadvantage to her. We have an
                innate talent among our young people in our creative industry,
                and that is something which we are looking to tap into. There
                are new technologies coming on board.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;McMenamin spoke about a cultural task
                force. We would not rule that out, and it is certainly in the
                melting pot. It is important to reflect that we have already a
                creative industries task group looking at film, Cinemagic and
                how we get involved in the new converging technologies, such as
                software and the Internet.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also have the creative industries task
                force, which is a United Kingdom wide vehicle, and we are
                interacting with colleagues in England, Scotland and Wales.
                Again, that is another mechanism for delivering ideas,
                strategies and policies. The idea of a cultural task force can
                go into the melting pot. I am not sure how to respond in so far
                as producing yet another grouping to go with that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Support for individual artists was mentioned,
                and again this is an important area. Over 1,000 people are
                employed in arts and crafts in the Province. That is part of the
                job creation and economic benefits we are deriving from an
                innate creativity and imagination in our population.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue of universal accessibility was
                raised by Mr&nbsp;McMenamin. He may be aware that we launched
                the Adapt programme recently. That aims to improve accessibility
                to the arts for those who suffer disability, by effectively
                auditing all arts and culture venues — whether they be
                museums, theatres, art galleries or heritage centres. There are
                approximately 300 venues for which the Department of Culture,
                Arts and Leisure is responsible. That is another area which we
                are trying to move forward on. Once we complete the audit we are
                determined to take the next step which will be the
                implementation stage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have referred to the review of the role of
                the Arts Council, and that will be the main mechanism for
                delivery. A number of areas have come forward under that review.
                The Chairman of the Arts Council referred to the review as ‘bracing’,
                and it was certainly not a review that simply looked at what has
                gone before and endorsed it. It made a number of suggestions on
                various areas, including transparency, the involvement of
                district councils, resources, extending participation, and, in
                particular, the review of the community arts sector, as already
                mentioned. That is important when we talk about community arts
                and amateur drama, and the Everitt Report points out that some
                20,000 people in Northern Ireland are involved in such
                activities. We looked at ways in which the Arts Council of
                Northern Ireland can support that area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Resources of course are extremely limited.
                The Chairman of the Culture, Arts and Leisure Committee, Mr
                ONeill, referred to £65 million, but this is a global figure
                and includes funding for libraries, which take up roughly a
                third of the budget, and sport, for which we allow roughly
                £2·5&nbsp;million in Northern Ireland. Were it not for the
                National Lottery top-ups, we could not survive. We also have
                other areas such as Ordnance Survey, the Public Record Office
                and museums, all of which are funded through my Department. It
                boils down to the fact that funding for the arts in Northern
                Ireland stands at a grand total of £7 million. We add on to
                that National Lottery top-ups, which is why we can make
                progress.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we were comparable with Scotland, we
                should look for an increase of around 40%. If we had the Great
                Britain average, we would receive a 16% increase. What we get
                through National Lottery funding is based on our percentage of
                the population, irrespective of need. It is recognised that when
                it comes to meeting our needs in Northern Ireland we are between
                15% and 20% behind the rest of the UK, not least because we have
                suffered from 30 years of violence, and not least because we
                have one of the youngest populations, if not the youngest, in
                Europe. Our needs are greater, and our funding for the arts has
                been abysmal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Weir referred to the fact that all
                sections in the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure are
                &quot;Cinderella&quot; sections. Libraries come under our remit
                because they used to be part of the Department of Education.
                Every time there was a financial constraint on education, the
                Department cut not the schools, or the youth service — or at
                least not to the same extent — but the libraries.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The same thing affected sports, and Members
                can see that £2·5&nbsp;million for all sports in Northern
                Ireland is indicative of the sort of challenge we face. The sum
                of £7 million is abysmal funding. One of the ways forward is to
                see what is happening in other countries. We need only look
                south of the border to see what is happening in the Irish
                Republic and the money that is spent there on arts and culture.
                People there recognise the connection between economic
                development and cultural tourism. They recognise that they can
                provide potential employers with a workforce that is creative
                and imaginative by getting into the cultural and artistic side
                of society and, in particular, by bringing on young people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It may be that our generation has lived too
                long to advance that theory now, but our young people have
                innate talent, and we have an opportunity to give them training
                and support to reinforce those natural talents so they can repay
                our society handsomely. We need only look around the world —
                take, for instance, the way in which creative industries have
                come on in places like Glasgow — to see the huge potential for
                economic development and job and wealth creation. If we look
                simply for value for money, we could not spend our money in any
                better way than this. It also channels the talents, energy,
                creativity and imagination of our young people down pathways
                such as the arts, cultural activity and sport, taking them away
                from other, more negative pursuits.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have tried to cover as many of the points
                as I can. I know that I have not covered them all. I am grateful
                that so many points have been raised, and I shall do my best to
                address those on Monday when I will be here to take Ministers’
                questions, and when I am next with the Committee. Culture, Arts
                and Leisure is a very exciting Department. I believe that I have
                the best job in the Executive, and I think other members of the
                Executive recognise that. The variety is here, the potential is
                here, and there is the ability to improve — to use Mr Doherty’s
                phrase, which I am very attached to — the quality of life of
                our people.</p>

                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have a very long saga to recount of the
                history of Antrim town centre. I hope it will be of interest not
                just to those of us who represent South Antrim. It certainly has
                implications right across Northern Ireland. I had hoped that my
                council colleagues, Cllr&nbsp;McClelland and Cllr&nbsp;Clyde,
                would have been in a position to contribute to this debate
                today, but perhaps you will keep me right from the Chair if
                necessary, Mr Deputy Speaker. The saga of this particular PFI
                Scheme involves two statutory agencies — the Transport Holding
                Company and the North Eastern Education and Library Board. It
                also involves what are now three different Departments of
                Government — Culture, Arts and Leisure, Regional Development
                and Finance and Personnel — and I am desperately hoping that
                at least one of them will manage to provide a Minister to
                respond to this debate in the near future. It is a rather
                complex issue which requires their attention.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As far back as 1984, when the Antrim area
                plan was developed, a site in the centre of the town was already
                identified for the development of a library and a bus station.
                It sits at the junction of Church Street and Railway Street in
                the very centre of the town. Part of it is now owned by the
                Transport Holding Company and part by the North Eastern
                Education and Library Board. It is an area of about an acre and
                occupies a prime town centre site. It is situated in the middle
                of the main street, with the high wall of the parish church on
                the other side. The fact that it lies empty restricts possible
                developments on either side, and it splits the town centre in
                two. It is having a hugely detrimental effect on the development
                of the town centre. That was the plan in 1984, but it was not
                until the autumn of 1990 that Ulsterbus announced plans to
                develop the site. Planning permission was granted in 1992 and an
                investment appraisal undertaken, but the black hole sat there.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sure that no Member for South Antrim
                would wish to stop this debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1993 a series of negotiations took place
                about land swaps and about various plans for the site. Ulsterbus
                was supposed to be taking the lead in a joint scheme with the
                North Eastern Education and Library Board. I remember shortly
                after my election to Antrim Council in 1993 that it was already
                a topic for discussion in the technical services committee.
                There was a concern about the state of the site and the
                detrimental effect it was having on the town centre. There were
                further talks in 1994, and I believe that planning permission
                was granted for a scheme at that stage. In 1995 there was
                another investment appraisal, and there was to be another delay.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was clear at that stage that the major
                problem was the Conservative Government’s economic policy.
                They refused to fund the necessary public infrastructure. I
                remember, as I am sure you do, Mr Deputy&nbsp;Speaker, a meeting
                with Mr&nbsp;Moss, who was then briefly the Minister for the
                Environment. He came to Antrim Council in late 1995 and was
                questioned about what was happening on the Ulsterbus site, as we
                now refer to it. He said he would review the matter again. In
                1996 a report arrived from the Minister. Now this was at the
                height of the Tory Party’s privatisation efforts and its
                enthusiasm for PFI so, according to Mr&nbsp;Moss, the way was
                now open to proceed under PFI. It could not proceed any other
                way.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the Chamber today we have heard some
                support for the concept of PFI and PPP. Four and a half years
                on, I have considerable doubts about their value since there has
                been no real progress, at least as far as the public is
                concerned. Of course, there has been much happening in the
                background.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The PFI procedure was supposed to have been
                implemented in early 1996 but it was after the change in
                Government, and long after the departure of Mr&nbsp;Moss, that a
                briefing meeting was held in January&nbsp;1998. In
                March&nbsp;1998 three parties were invited to negotiate. Bids
                were submitted in July&nbsp;1998, although only from two
                parties, and they made their best and final offers in December
                1998 — only three years after the Minister announced that we
                would be proceeding through PFI as the best and speediest way of
                implementing this scheme for the good of the people of Antrim.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By the spring of 1999 it was clear that all
                was not well. There were stories that the PFI would be
                terminated on grounds of cost. In May 1999 I was approached by
                an agent for one consortium and informed that it believed that
                PFI was not being properly implemented in this respect. I was
                told, and I have no reason to doubt it, that there was a
                unilateral demand for reduction in the price of the scheme. That
                was in contravention of the scheme drawn up by the Government as
                to how PFI should be implemented. I was shown a copy of the
                guidelines. The penultimate saga is described as &quot;final
                negotiation over the proposals&quot;. It has also been
                described, perhaps more accurately, as &quot;a bit of a haggle
                over the details of the scheme&quot;. Yet it appeared, and my
                understanding is, that this was driven by the Department of
                Finance and Personnel. I would be interested to hear the
                Minister’s response. The haggling over the details was
                ignored, and there was simply to be a unilateral decision to
                require a price reduction, or nothing would happen.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I contacted Paul&nbsp;Murphy and
                Lord&nbsp;Dubs, the Ministers then responsible for the
                Department of Finance and Personnel and the Department of
                Environment. I also obtained the support of Antrim Council in
                June&nbsp;1999. That particular bidder met the council in the
                summer of 1999 and showed models and plans for what the scheme
                might have entailed. By September Lord&nbsp;Dubs advised the
                council that a meeting was being arranged with both bidders.
                However, it took another letter, and it was in October 1999,
                following a further intervention by Lord&nbsp;Dubs, before the
                two bidders were invited to submit their revised bids. Further
                bids were then submitted in November 1999 — we are now nearing
                4&nbsp;years from the time that the PFI scheme was introduced as
                a speedy way of resolving the problem. By February this year,
                the company that had first contacted me told me that it was now
                being recommended as the preferred bidder.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, there was a further wrangle about
                incurring costs in advance of final approval. It appeared that
                the company was being asked to undertake further work before it
                was given the full approval, and it would be at certain
                financial risk in so doing. Given the wrangles that had gone on
                over many years and the difficulties it had, I find it difficult
                to suggest that the company should have been anything other than
                cautious in its approach in dealing with that aspect. I
                understand that in February this year, and for four months
                since, the company has been told that news is expected soon,
                every time it has asked. Soon means many things. Those of us who
                have been through the entire negotiations that led up to Good
                Friday in 1998 should, perhaps, be cautious of criticising
                others. Soon for something that was supposed to have been
                finalised at least a year ago is not very soon.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope I have managed to give a reasonably
                accurate picture of this particular project and all the traumas
                it has been through, although I have shorn off an awful lot of
                detail. I felt it was necessary to do it for two main reasons.
                First, I wanted to highlight the problems that have been caused
                to Antrim and its people by the delay in this scheme. A crucial
                town centre scheme has moved nowhere for five years, despite
                constant allegations that this is the speediest way of dealing
                with it. Secondly, it raises many and detailed questions about
                the PFI process. I am glad that the Minister of Finance is now
                here to respond to my concerns, and no doubt the Minister for
                Regional Development will be in a position to wink across the
                Chamber at him as well.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have some philosophical concerns with PFI.
                I have made this clear to those with whom I have been talking,
                who are engaged in the PFI process. There are major problems in
                some schemes across the water. In hospitals and schools, for
                example, the management of a facility appears at times to come
                extraordinarily close to issues of clinical judgement or
                professional competence of teaching staff.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are major problems in the
                implementation of PFI schemes in that respect. There is also the
                issue that at times, despite the cost of Government borrowing’s
                being lower than that in the private sector, PFI schemes have
                added to the cost rather than decreased it. This should have
                been the ideal scheme for PFI. It was a simple scheme to manage
                and build a library, a small bus facility, some shops and some
                residential accommodation; there were no major complications of
                professional competence, no major difficulties in terms of who
                was responsible for which aspects of the work. It was easy to
                divide between the various agencies and the private-sector
                bidder.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this case the private sector produced
                better plans than those that were originally produced by the
                Transport Holding Company and the North Eastern Education and
                Library Board. There is no doubt that for a commercial
                town-centre site, the commercial impetus of a private-sector
                bidder has added additional shopping facilities and
                accommodation and has produced a better plan. However, a better
                plan is no use to the people of Antrim if something does not
                appear on the ground. Even with these better plans, this saga
                has been going on for over four years, with no sign of any
                movement. The Department of the Environment, Transport and
                Regions in England, or Great Britain, or wherever its precise
                remit covers, has produced a report suggesting that PFI is not
                the appropriate way to proceed for schemes of less than
                £10&nbsp;million.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It seems to be parallel with what some of us
                would call compulsory tendering in councils. Because PFI is not
                the right way to proceed, there is this huge issue of small
                bodies or small schemes being subject to massive additional
                costs and over-administration. That appears to be borne out in
                every case by this scheme. PFI is being forced upon us by the
                initial policy decisions of the Conservative party, which have
                been implemented without change by the new Labour Government,
                and that has been detrimental to us all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a town, Antrim currently has major
                development opportunities. It recently submitted an application
                for out-of-town retailing which has been rejected but which
                gives the town centre a major opportunity to develop. There are
                possibilities of new housing, which you and I, Mr Deputy
                Speaker, remember from our rows with the planners on the issue
                of the redundant Massereene Hospital site’s being used for
                commercial development sitting, as it does, in a town- centre
                location. All these things are going ahead, and yet the scheme,
                which is supposed to have been in the public sector for almost
                16&nbsp;years as a plan to move on, is now lost in the ether,
                and nothing is happening. We talked about public transport
                earlier, and here is a scheme that aims to provide the
                facilities to bring quality public transport into the town
                centre for the benefit of those who are taking their custom to
                the shops there, yet nothing has been done about it. This gap is
                likely to continue, with no sign of movement. Most other things
                are going ahead, while we sit with an empty site, blocking the
                development from one end of the main street to the other and
                also blocking the view of any possible development up Railway
                Street towards the hospital site.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, I hope that at the end of this
                debate the Minister will be able to tell us two things; first,
                can he explain to the people of Antrim what is happening to the
                Ulsterbus site, and how we will get the public transport and
                library facility? Unfortunately the Minister of Culture, Arts
                and Leisure has left, so he cannot hear my praise for the
                Library Service about which, I am sure, he would have been
                pleased. Secondly, I would like the Minister to tell us how his
                Department is going to deal with such a dilemma in the future.
                This saga illustrates the past failures of PFI under the
                Department of Finance and Personnel to produce any real benefits
                for the people of Antrim and the people of Northern Ireland,
                even in a scheme as simple as this.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr William McCrea:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can understand the genuine frustration that
                the people of Antrim are currently suffering as a result of the
                inactivity of those who have the responsibility of ensuring that
                this building is erected in Antrim. The scheme is an imaginative
                one, the plans are excellent, and the people of Antrim would be
                well served if it were fully built and operational. The problem
                lies in getting it from the initial planning stage to full
                planning stage and then actually building it. I understand the
                Members for the area raising the issue in the Chamber, and I
                would like to apologise for my Colleague Mr&nbsp;Clyde who is at
                the funeral of a close friend and is unable to join us in the
                debate. For a long time elected representatives in Antrim,
                including my colleagues, Cllrs Clyde, Dunlop and McClay and
                others, have fought valiantly to make representations about this
                delayed scheme. It has a long history, but we cannot go back,
                and, we cannot change that. I trust that we can give an impetus
                to the scheme to ensure that it moves on.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Six years ago the North Eastern Education and
                Library Board entered into deep and genuine discussions about
                pooling its land with the land which was under the control of
                the Transport Holding Company. They decided together on an
                imaginative scheme which would permit the Transport Holding
                Company to take full responsibility for building the property.
                It was agreed that the Education and Library Board would repay a
                sum of between £50,000 and £60,000 each year for five years
                until its part of the scheme was paid off. That was not only an
                imaginative scheme; it was the proper initiative to take and the
                best way forward. The two schemes were coming together with the
                pooling of land and resources, and in five&nbsp;years the board
                should have owned the library. They felt that it was the best
                way in which to handle public funds, and I certainly agreed with
                their approach.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the relevant Departments said that
                the scheme could not proceed if the board accepted rent under
                the PFI directive, a directive that Government policy dictated.
                Even though the board had spent a considerable amount of finance
                on legal and consultative fees, and the PFI procedure would
                delay the project for a considerable time, they were told by the
                Department that it had to be done in this way. The board and the
                Holding Company went through all the procedures, involving an
                outline business plan, legal advisers, consultants and
                advertising, and then they were told to enter into negotiations
                with bidders, making a full business case.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The offers finally came in but were
                unacceptable on two counts. First, the project was now
                unaffordable and, secondly, the bid fell outside the
                public-sector comparators. The board and the Transport Holding
                Company asked if it was possible to go through the normal
                procurement route, but they were told that they must re-open
                negotiations with the private developers. So, once again, it
                went back into the melting pot of negotiations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An amended copy of the final business case
                was eventually presented, and a bid was both acceptable and
                affordable to those who were involved in the negotiations. The
                board and the Transport Holding Company await the final approval
                before matters can proceed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, that that is not the end of the
                story. It will take time to reach the final planning stage and
                then it will take another year for the actual building. The
                people of Antrim could be two years away from getting their bus
                station and library and the shops that are to be included in the
                development. The development itself is excellent, and we should
                do everything in our power to encourage it. It will certainly
                bring quality, public transport, and quality shops into the
                centre of Antrim. It will help to regenerate the town and ensure
                it is kept very much alive and busy by bringing people right
                into its very heart.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is one of the attractive things. It is
                bringing the people, using the public transport we talked about
                this morning, into the very heart of the town. That is what we
                want to see, to encourage the development and expansion of
                Antrim, with its heart being very much alive and a vibrant
                economic entity.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The question remains: why the delay? I am led
                to believe that the Ministers concerned have the final papers on
                their desks now. I ask them to look very quickly at those
                papers. The Minister for Regional Development and the Minister
                of Finance and Personnel are sitting here now. I trust that they
                will both ensure that the papers on their desks are approved.
                There is anxiety among those involved that something actually be
                done. It should be done.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This scheme probably falls outside the
                criteria for PFI. I am told that the scheme is too small, at
                just over £1&nbsp;million, for PFI investors to find it
                attractive. There were no groups of people jumping up and down
                to take on this particular scheme. Even in the education sector,
                schools are being lumped together to try and constitute schemes
                that are appropriate for PFI. The route that has been taken has
                created an unnecessary delay. I ask the Ministers and
                Departments concerned to ensure that there is no further delay.
                They should get it off their desks, allow this money to be spent
                in the centre of Antrim and ensure that the people of Antrim are
                well served with an up-to-date library and an up-to-date,
                quality public transport system. I support Mr Ford, and I trust
                success will be forthcoming through continued representations.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Finance and Personnel
                (Mr&nbsp;Durkan): </b>I thank both Members for their
                contributions. I apologise to Mr Ford for my not being in the
                Chamber for his opening remarks. They were available to me
                through the technology that we have on the premises, so all I
                missed was whatever was said while I was coming down the stairs.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That was the important bit.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Lucky I missed it then. I will write to the
                Member when I read it in Hansard. A variety of points were made
                and many questions were raised about the whole issue of PFI and
                PPP, and there were also particular points relating to this
                specific project. I will deal with the general points first.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Public/private partnerships allow the
                expertise and methods of the private sector to be deployed in
                the public sector. That has the potential to bring greater
                efficiency, along with a focus on achieving long term value for
                money over the duration of a project, which can be 20 years or
                more. The Private Finance Initiative (PFI) is a form of
                public/private partnership where the private sector is involved
                as a provider of capital assets as well as services. PFI
                projects frequently involve construction or renovation of
                buildings, as is the case with the proposed bus station, library
                and retail units in Antrim.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of my most important roles as Minister of
                Finance and Personnel is to ensure that we obtain the maximum
                benefit and value for money from the resources available. This
                calls for a rigorous, realistic approach to questions of how
                public services can best be delivered. The need for this is re-inforced
                by the concerns that are continually being raised by Members
                over the level of resources available for particular services.
                When taken together, these concerns cover just about every
                service. This point was brought home, certainly to me, during
                the recent debate on the 2000/2001 Main Estimates and was
                emphasised again today during the debate on public transport.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Against this background we need to explore,
                and be ready to exploit fully, any method of delivering services
                that offers potential for improvement over the more traditional
                ways of procuring new assets in the public sector. I hardly need
                to remind Members that these traditional methods are not always
                fault-free, with cost overruns and delays in construction
                occurring perhaps too often. With a PFI project it is likely
                that such risks will be wholly or substantially transferred to
                the private sector, which should be better able to manage them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are great challenges confronting us
                with the improvements that we wish to see in education, health,
                transport, housing and many other public services. We have also
                inherited a backlog of maintenance work. In facing these
                challenges we cannot afford to ignore what the private sector
                has to offer by way of potentially better solutions and fresh
                thinking. To do so would be to do a disservice to the people.
                Indeed, we would find ourselves as a minority of one because
                other countries and territories throughout Europe and the world
                have increasingly looked to the private sector for help with
                similar problems. I am sure that this is not a distinction that
                we would want to bring on ourselves.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland has so far had a reasonably
                good record of successful PFI projects, two of which have this
                month won an award or been highly commended nationally. So far,
                deals worth some £53&nbsp;million in estimated capital value
                have been signed across a wide range of services including
                information technology, water and sewerage, education and
                health. A further £560&nbsp;million worth of deals are at
                various stages of completion on public transport, education and
                health, and there may be potential for much more such funding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Both Dr&nbsp;McCrea and Mr&nbsp;Ford
                suggested that schemes under £10&nbsp;million were not suitable
                for PFI. The test for PFI schemes is value for money. The size
                of the scheme is one factor, but it is not the only
                consideration. Many smaller successful schemes have been
                implemented here in Northern Ireland and elsewhere. The value of
                the scheme that was referred to, contrary to some of the figures
                that were suggested, is really around £3&nbsp;million. However,
                public/private partnerships and PFI are not panaceas. There are
                limitations as well as opportunities. We need to identify the
                potential opportunities in order to decide which solution will
                work best in particular circumstances. The key test, as I have
                said, is value for money. My Department works very closely with
                other Departments in helping to analyse business proposals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The deals under public/private partnerships
                and PFI are generally more complex than traditional methods of
                procurement, and therefore they do take more time. This is only
                to be expected given the length of time for which these deals
                have to run, and the number of services which may be involved.
                Both public and private sectors have been on a learning curve. I
                hope that this is now behind us and that these lessons will help
                us. We should now be in a better position to identify suitable
                new projects and to speed up the processes in the future.
                Departments have developed their own expertise, and they also
                have available to them a competitive field of experienced
                private-sector consultants to help take projects forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For more innovative and complex projects,
                Departments will also be able to call upon the services of the
                newly established Partnerships UK. This organisation has taken
                over from the Treasury taskforce and has the sole mission of
                helping the public sector with PPP and PFI deals. In addition, I
                will be looking to see if there are any ways in which my
                Department can be of further help in supporting PPP and PFI
                projects.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to questions raised specifically
                about the Antrim project, I can well understand the frustration
                felt by Mr&nbsp;Ford and expressed by the Mr&nbsp;McCrea at the
                length of time that it has taken to reach a conclusion on the
                Antrim bus station and library project. As I said at the outset,
                the prime focus of my Department throughout the process has
                been, and will remain, on obtaining value for money. That is the
                Department’s job.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Contrary to some of the impressions given,
                the Department of Finance and Personnel has not been the source
                of the ongoing lengthy delay throughout the life of this
                project. The Department of Finance has had to respond to the
                papers that it received and relay its consideration back to the
                relevant Department. The relevant Department has, in turn, had
                its work to do in relation to the PFI procedures. It would have
                had to do further work anyway for economic appraisal purposes
                had it been going down the traditional procurement route. People
                should be careful not to misrepresent the Department of Finance
                and Personnel’s contribution to this exercise. I am prepared
                to sit down with the Member and take him through my Department’s
                calendar of involvement. It will be clear that the Department of
                Finance and Personnel did not hold up progress on the project.
                It has achieved reasonably quick turnarounds in its responses
                to, and considerations of, this particular project.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Where the search for value for money
                indicates that a PPP or PFI solution will give better value for
                money than traditional procurement, then my Department will
                quite rightly seek to ensure that a PPP or PFI solution is
                pursued. As the Antrim case has evolved, it has become
                increasingly clear that the PFI option is likely to provide the
                better value that we are seeking if limited funds are to be used
                to best advantage. I understand that a revised business case,
                incorporating all the necessary information, is now being
                finalised by the Department for Regional Development. My
                Department expects to receive this in the next few days, and I
                hope that it may be possible to make an announcement soon.</p>

                being made to pay tribute to the exceptional service of the Fire
                Service over the last thirty years. The Fire Authority will
                strike a medal that will be awarded to all fire fighters having
                at least three years’ continual service with good conduct;
                this includes service between 1969 and 2000. Other brigade staff
                with five years’ service, which includes service within this
                period, will be presented with a medallion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first award ceremony will take place in
                the Great Hall, Parliament Buildings, later in the summer, when
                I will present the first awards to a number of firefighters and
                brigade support staff. Fire-fighting is very dangerous work, and
                it is to be regretted that many firefighters have been injured,
                and a number have lost their lives while protecting the public
                and trying to save property. Many people owe their lives to the
                courage and skill of our firefighters and the important
                contribution of brigade support staff. I am sure that all
                Members will agree with me that the award of these medals and
                medallions is well-deserved recognition for this vital work.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Lewsley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend the Minister for recognising the
                work of the Northern Ireland Fire Brigade by awarding this
                medal. It is most appropriate given the low morale over recent
                months and the fact that over the last 30&nbsp;years the Fire
                Service has provided an excellent service and shown a commitment
                to the community throughout the troubles, sometimes putting
                their own lives at risk. Would the Minister agree that given
                that public safety is at the core of this issue, there is a need
                to redress the balance to bring the local fire brigade numbers
                into line with the services in the rest of the UK? Considering
                the size and the population of Northern Ireland, it would also
                be beneficial if the Fire Service were to receive a significant
                increase in funding to enable it to increase its recruitment
                programme to provide adequate coverage in all areas in the North
                of Ireland.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms de Brún:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Member’s tributes for the
                Fire Service. It is to be understood that the fire brigade here
                is a labour-intensive organisation with over 900&nbsp;whole-time
                and over 900 part-time firefighters. The target establishment
                for the whole-time firefighters is 919 personnel, 899 of whom
                are in post, leaving a shortfall of 20. The target establishment
                for part-time firefighters is 980, and 917 are in post which is
                a shortfall of 63. Those are comprehensive numbers in terms of
                staffing levels here. Following the comprehensive spending
                review in 1999, additional moneys were allocated to the Fire
                Service. The moratorium on recruitment was, therefore, able to
                be lifted. Twenty-five additional firefighters were recruited in
                August&nbsp;1999, and a further 25&nbsp;recruits had their
                passing-out parade only last week. The fire authority is
                experiencing difficulty in recruiting part-time firefighters,
                but its preference is to recruit part-time firefighters on a
                24-hour call-out basis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In terms of the question the Member asked
                about money and investment, the Fire Authority baseline budget
                allocation has risen, and this is significant. It has risen from
                £43·7&nbsp;million in 1998/99 to £51·4&nbsp;million for
                2000/01. An additional £4·9&nbsp;million was allocated last
                year, which is an increase of £8·5&nbsp;million in real terms.
                The £51·4&nbsp;million allocation for this year represents an
                increase of £2·9&nbsp;million over the 1999/00 allocation,
                representing a 3% increase in real terms.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have also seen modernisation and
                improvement in the standard of fire services, which is being
                pursued through the development and efficient maintenance of a
                fire brigade fleet and fire-fighting equipment. The comparative
                cost of fire services in England for 1999/00 was £30,024, in
                Wales it was £32,055 and here it was £26,654, so there are
                significant comparisons.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, it does not take a statement from
                an IRA/Sinn Féin Minister to get Members on this side of the
                House to congratulate the Fire Service for their sterling work
                in preserving property, life and limb from fire and danger in
                this society over recent decades. Can the Minister confirm to
                the House how many fires the Fire Service has had to attend and
                put out as a result of Provisional IRA bombs? What has been the
                cost to the Fire Service in terms of manpower and resources in
                dealing with such bomb attacks and tackling fires caused by
                terrorism in Northern&nbsp;Ireland?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Did the Minister, when meeting the Fire
                Service, apologise to it for the years of bomb attacks that
                placed the lives of firemen in jeopardy because of the
                activities of members of her party? Has she called on her
                community to cease from stoning and attacking firemen and
                stopping them from doing their duty? Should the Minister not be
                embarrassed by coming to this House and announcing an award to a
                Fire Service that her party tried to expunge from existence in
                Northern Ireland?</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not possible to disaggregate those
                fires and other incidents that the Fire Service has attended
                over the last 30 years which specifically emanated from the
                conflict or from any section of the community from those which
                occurred for other reasons. We can all recite specific incidents
                which occurred in the course of the conflict over the past 30
                years and engage in pointing the finger of blame. I had hoped
                that today would not be about political point-scoring. That is
                certainly not my intention, and I hope that Members will not
                wish to engage in that either. Today we give due recognition to
                the Fire Service’s labour for all sections of the community
                throughout the period, often at great personal risk to its
                members.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I sincerely welcome the Minister’s
                statement. The awards are long overdue, given the Fire Service’s
                bravery over the years of the troubles. Even now its members are
                being attacked on the streets by all sides. This is not the time
                for making political statements. Rather we should be thankful
                for this announcement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask the Minister to give serious
                consideration to reviewing existing Fire Service provision
                throughout Northern Ireland, bearing in mind that, in recent
                times, there has been a significant population growth in a
                number of areas which still only have part-time firemen and
                facilities. The time has now come for full-time Fire Service
                provision to be made in these areas.</p>

                shall ensure are passed on to the Fire Service. It is fitting
                today that we give recognition to the Fire Service. We all wish
                it well in the work that it is carrying out today, just as we
                wish those well who have carried out such work over the past 30
                years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have given some details of significant
                investment in existing provision. I should be happy to write to
                the Member if he wishes to raise specific areas with me where it
                is felt that existing provision should be altered.</p>

                have pointed out that this is not an occasion for political
                point-scoring. We have met members of the Fire Service Union
                and, indeed, the Fire Authority itself on several occasions, and
                those meetings were extremely amicable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the health authority we have spoken about
                the integration of the Fire Service and the Ambulance Service.
                Would the Minister like to comment on that? Does the Minister
                recognise the need for North/South co-operation between the fire
                brigades? Have any formal arrangements been put in place for
                this?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms de Brún:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is already good co-operation between
                the Fire Service and the Ambulance Service in training and
                communications. The inclusion of responsibility for fire and
                ambulance services under a single Department will, of course,
                now provide greater opportunities for increased co-operation and
                efficiency, including joint training and the sharing of premises
                for vehicles. I also expected it to lead to the development of a
                common communications infrastructure and joint approaches to the
                provision of information to the public about access to public
                safety.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to North/South co-operation, the
                Fire Service maintains a good working relationship with brigades
                in the South. There is a formal arrangement with Donegal County
                Council in which the Fire Service provides fire and emergency
                cover for East Donegal. The cost of doing so is a retainer of
                £3,500 per annum and a charge of £195.50 per appliance per
                call out. Cross-border protocols exist between local fire
                stations also in terms of responding to emergencies. Contacts
                have been established with the Dublin Fire Brigade for joint
                training initiatives and for considering questions of, for
                example, advanced technology. There is ongoing co-operation
                therefore. As part of their fleet replacement programme, smaller
                fire brigades in the South purchase some of the Fire Service’s
                older appliances that have become surplus to requirements.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the announcement of the award to
                the Fire Service. Does the Minister intend to give posthumous
                awards? I believe that the first person who died as a result of
                a bomb explosion was Mr&nbsp;Wesley&nbsp;Orr from Lisburn.</p>
                <b>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are talking about bringing forward
                proposals that have been under consideration for some time in
                terms of the recognition for firefighters. The type of award
                that was to be brought forward had been discussed between
                members of the Fire Service Past Members’ Association and
                previous Ministers with responsibility for the Fire Service. I
                have not yet given any consideration to further awards, or other
                forms of awards. I think we need to mark quite clearly our
                regret that nine firefighters lost their lives, and that
                hundreds of firefighters were injured in the last 30&nbsp;years.
                Again, I have to say that it is not possible to disaggregate the
                specific causes and the specific contexts in which those
                occurred. It is a matter of regret to us all that firefighters
                lose their lives defending our population, and we should give
                them every recognition for the service they have given.</p>

                the Fire Service is long overdue. I have a couple of questions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can the Minister inform us of the total
                number of house fires that have taken place over the last two
                years? Will she work with the Minister for Social Development to
                ensure that all public and private sector housing will be fitted
                with smoke alarms as a matter of urgency to reduce the number of
                senseless deaths?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms de Brún:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I fully support the points the Member made in
                her question about the need for smoke alarms. I am sure she will
                agree that the Fire Service has recently undertaken significant
                initiatives to ensure that smoke alarms are not only fitted but
                tested regularly. There has been some success in this, and I
                want to pay tribute to it for this. I should certainly be quite
                happy not only when it is necessary but when we wish to see
                co-operation between different Departments to ensure that it is
                possible. I shall write to the Member with a specific answer.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to welcome the statement from the
                Minister today and make it known to the House that some tribute
                should be paid to Mr Harry Martin, the secretary of the Retired
                Firefighters’ Association, who has steadfastly campaigned for
                this medal for the past five years. It is through Mr Martin’s
                sterling work that this has been brought to people’s
                attention. I approached Mr Martin some time ago to become
                involved in trying to promote this issue as well, and the
                Minister will be aware of this from some of the correspondence
                on the file. I am glad to hear that this is going to happen, for
                the Fire Service deserves to be recognised for the work it has
                done for the entire community. The medal will go some way
                towards recognising the service that has been given by the Fire
                Service to all members of the community, from whatever side. I
                welcome this statement today.</p>

                attention of the Ministers responsible for the Fire Service has
                been commendable. I am glad — in fact, honoured — to have

                firefighters’ courage over the last 30 years in particular. I
                should like the Minister to comment on her reply to a question
                when she said that it was a source of regret that nine
                firefighters had lost their lives as a result of the troubles.
                Will she now go further and lend credibility to her statement by
                condemning the terrorists for their actions that led to those

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must point out to the Member that I did not
                say that. I pointed out that nine firefighters had lost their
                lives over the last 30 years. It is not possible to disaggregate
                figures into those who lost their lives in the conflict and
                those who lost their lives fighting fires in other
                circumstances. I have therefore stated clearly that I note not
                only that firefighters have lost their lives, but that hundreds
                of others have been injured fighting fires. It is not for the
                Department to try to disaggregate the causes of those fires. My
                wish today is to pay tribute to the firefighters’ service, and
                it is a source of regret to me that firefighters have been
                injured or lost their lives in carrying out this tremendous
                work.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can assure the Minister that Mr Wesley Orr
                was killed by a bomb explosion in Belfast. It should not be too
                hard to find that out from the Department.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I join with all those who have welcomed this
                long-overdue award for those who have served in the Fire
                Service. We all agree on the tremendous, sterling work that they
                have done, especially in the difficult circumstances of the last
                30 years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to question the Minister further
                about some of the statements that she has made. Surely it must
                be possible to have these figures disaggregated. Whether or not
                it is possible, she may not wish to do it now, but it must
                surely be possible to have figures supplied on who was
                responsible for arson and bomb attacks over the years. At the
                very least, the Chief Constable issues certificates on many of
                these attacks, so the information will be on record.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further to the previous question, instead of
                obscuring the issue of who was responsible for particular
                deaths, will the Minister take the opportunity now —
                regardless of which terrorist organisation was responsible —
                not to waffle or be ambiguous but to condemn clearly those
                terrorist outrages and make her position absolutely clear?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also time for the Minister, instead of
                coming here and paying tribute to the Fire Service, which is
                incumbent on all of us, to take the opportunity to pay tribute
                to the other emergency services, notably the police and the
                Army, instead of condoning the murder and maiming of their
                officers and soldiers.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While I have said that it has not been
                possible to disaggregate figures, I am in no way taking away
                from the fact that at the very beginning of my statement I made
                it very clear that I wish to advise Members of the arrangements
                which are being made to pay tribute to the exceptional service
                of the Fire Service over the last 30&nbsp;years. The context in
                which I made that statement is therefore very clear, as was the
                context in which those firefighters carried out their work over
                the last 30&nbsp;years. I have, however, no intention of being
                diverted from what today is about. The suffering which all
                sections of the community have endured over the past
                30&nbsp;years, as a result of the conflict, is a matter for
                regret. Firefighters suffered too, and I regret that and I
                recognise that. <i>[Interruption]</p>

                regrettably, that has come about because of pressure from, and
                lobbying by, the Fire Service and others. I also concur with
                what Mr&nbsp;Dalton said about Harry&nbsp;Martin. He is the

                investment here. The Fire Authority has a baseline budget
                allocation that has risen from £43·7&nbsp;million in 1998/99
                to £51·4&nbsp;million in 2000/01. An additional
                £4·9&nbsp;million was allocated last year, an increase of
                8·5% in real terms. On this year’s resources,
                £51·4&nbsp;million represents an increase of
                £2·9&nbsp;million over the 1999/00 allocation, a real terms

                30&nbsp;years, have been murdered due to IRA/Sinn&nbsp;Féin
                activity? Is it possible for the Minister of Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA

                community, particularly in the public sector, and calls upon the
                Equality Commission to address this problem as a matter of
                urgency.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is more than 22 years since the first
                publication by what was then the Fair Employment Agency on the
                subject of fair employment. Many other publications and reports
                have followed. There have been many references in all of those
                publications to the fact that Roman Catholic males are twice as
                likely to be unemployed as Protestant males. This simplistic
                cliché has underpinned almost all Government legislation since
                1978. There has never been any attempt to accept that, at the
                outset of Northern Ireland’s troubled existence, the leaders
                of Roman Catholic opinion in Northern Ireland called for
                Catholics not to take positions in the Civil Service, the
                largest single employer in the country. It was gross hypocrisy
                then, almost fifty years later, for that same community to
                complain about not getting the jobs it had previously advocated
                not taking up.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since the violence erupted in 1969 there has
                been a huge increase in security-related employment, and because
                of IRA intimidation there has been a low uptake from Roman
                Catholics in that sector. Unfortunately, very little reference
                is made in successive fair employment reports to these
                uncomfortable but factual positions. At the outset others and I
                were very critical of those early reports in that they excluded
                any reference to the discrimination against Protestants.
                Initially, those of us who campaigned on that issue were
                dismissed as being inaccurate or as being only partially
                correct.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After the evidence began to mount, the
                defence from the Fair Employment Agency, later the Fair
                Employment Commission, against these allegations was that
                unfairness against the Protestant community was contained to
                very small geographic areas. Today I intend to demonstrate that
                there is widespread disadvantage being suffered now by the
                Protestant community right across Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to turn now to present day events.
                Quite often in the Equality Commission reports we get facts and
                figures which can mislead people. The most relevant section of
                the tenth monitoring report is chapter five, entitled
                &quot;Applicants and Appointees&quot;. I have made the point
                over and over again to successive Government Departments that
                the composition of a company or a public sector body, many of
                whose employees were employed twenty, thirty or forty years ago,
                is not important. That is of little relevance. What is of
                relevance is what those companies and the public sector are
                doing now, not whom they employed in 1960, 1970 or 1980, but
                whom they are employing today. That is the relevant and most
                significant section of any report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion refers to the public sector. In
                table 41 from chapter five of the report we can see exactly how
                many people applied for positions in the public sector. This is
                not a small position in some corner; this is not some minor
                firm; this is the public sector, which had 125,448 applicants,
                one in four of the entire employed population of Northern
                Ireland. We are not talking about a sector or a small geographic
                area. We are talking about a swath of people looking for
                employment — more than 125,000 of them. If we exclude, as the
                Equality Commission has done, the applicants who cannot easily
                be put into either Protestant or Roman Catholic categories, we
                are left with 55% who are Protestants and almost 45% who are
                Catholic, and that in itself shows a very slight
                under-representation of Protestants. It is known that of the
                available workforce in Northern Ireland approximately 57% are
                Protestant, so we have a slight under-representation of
                Protestants applying for positions in the public sector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This cause for concern is minimal, however,
                compared to the concern we have about those who were appointed
                from the 125,000 plus applicants — 16,101 people in all, a
                figure which breaks down to show 52% Protestants and almost 48%
                Catholics. I want to be absolutely clear, so that people know
                exactly what we are talking about, that this covers all sectors
                across Northern Ireland and shows not only an
                underrepresentation of Protestants applying for positions in the
                public sector, but a further under-representation of Protestants
                actually getting jobs in it. Only 52% were successful while
                Protestants make up 57% of the working population in Northern
                Ireland. As I say, more than 16,000 were recruited, and only 52%
                of them were Protestant.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to look at a couple of sectors to
                emphasise the point. In the health sector, 36,000 people applied
                for employment last year, of whom 49% were Protestant. Remember,
                it ought to have been 57%. Now, if we had expected 57% of those
                recruited to be Protestant, we would have been disappointed.
                Only 48% were Protestant — an under-representation of
                Protestants being employed in the health sector. Now lest anyone
                think that we are talking about a small number of people, over
                6,000 people were offered employment last year in the health
                sector, and only 49% of them were Protestant.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We now turn to the huge education sector
                within the huge public sector where 16,564 people applied for
                jobs. Only 53·8% of them were Protestant — a 4%
                under-representation of the Protestant community in people
                applying for, not getting, jobs. What happened after that? Only
                48% of them were successful. The pattern is emerging in
                department after department, and this time we are talking about
                3,666 people who were successful in getting employment in the
                education sector — another very sizeable number of people.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will move on to the issue of how this
                under-representation is defended. Often when I and others quote
                these statistics, which as I often say are not our statistics,
                but Government statistics from the agency set up to monitor the
                public sector, a defence is made which I call the quality
                defence. That means that there is a fall-back position. Some
                Government officials and some people in the old Fair Employment
                Commission would have said &quot;Yes, the number of Protestants
                being employed is quite small, as you, Mr&nbsp;Campbell, and
                others, allege, but the quality of the jobs, the people at the
                top end of the public sector are very predominantly
                Protestant.&quot; In other words, it is this nonsense that I
                hear from some commentators that Catholics get the menial jobs
                and the Protestants get the cream. That is a total and utter
                fallacy. The fallacy is proven by table 43 in chapter&nbsp;5 of
                the monitoring report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What does it tell us? It uses a breakdown
                called the Standard Occupational Classification, which runs from
                SOC1 to SOC9. SOC1 jobs are the most highly paid positions:
                managers and administrators. SOC2 covers the professional
                occupations. SOC3s are associate professional and technical
                occupations. And so it goes, down to the lower grades at SOC9.
                If the myth and the nonsense were accurate, one would expect to
                see the highest numbers of Protestants at the higher grades, if
                what I hear from the pan-Nationalist front was accurate. In
                reality, it is the reverse. If we look at SOC1, SOC2 and SOC3,
                the three highest grades in the public sector, they have the
                lowest Protestant success rates. The higher the grade in the
                public sector, the less likely you are to find a Protestant.
                That is what this report tells us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Looking at SOC1, 48% of those appointed last
                year were Protestant, and almost 52% Catholic. At the second
                highest grade, 47% were Protestant and 53% Catholic. At the
                third highest grade, 48% to just over 51%. You have to go right
                down to the bottom grades to get a higher number of Protestants,
                yet there are those who would tell us that Protestants get the
                most jobs and the best jobs. In reality, Protestants do not get
                their fair share of jobs, and the jobs that they do get are less
                qualified and lower paid. That may be uncomfortable, and people
                may rail against it and complain about it and not like it, but
                it is reality. They will have to face up to it. Where does that
                bring us?</p>

                decreases, the figure for non-returned or non-determined

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the hon Member for that inaccurate
                intervention. The Equality Commission has actually said that,
                over the years, the non-determined are decreasing in number, not
                increasing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to come to my conclusion. There have
                been many figures, and I appreciate that those who have not got
                an intense interest might be somewhat confused, but I have tried
                to cut through the confusion and use these statistics to show
                that the myth and the campaign of nonsense is just that. It is
                utter nonsense.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, this report proves three
                things. First, it proves that Protestants are slightly
                under-represented in the number of applicants to the public
                service. This cannot be refuted. Secondly, Protestants are even
                more under-represented in the numbers appointed to the positions
                for which they have applied. Again, this is irrefutable. To say
                otherwise is to deny the statistics contained in the report.
                Thirdly, Protestants are losing out in the higher grade of
                classification in the public sector, and, again, this cannot be
                refuted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That brings us to what we have come to know
                as the equality agenda. Many people, both in this House and
                outside it, have campaigned on an equality agenda and have
                emphasised the need for equality. This infers that there is
                inequality at the moment. These statistics show that there is
                inequality but that it is suffered by the Unionist community.
                The Protestants are the people who are under-represented in the
                public sector and this needs to be addressed immediately by the
                Equality Commission. It must devote sufficient resources to an
                investigation of this problem as a matter of the utmost urgency.</p>

                practising rigid equality by reducing everyone equally.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I too welcome the Equality Commission’s
                tenth annual monitoring report. I will make some important
                statements of principle at the outset. My party stands full
                square on the principle of equality of opportunity — accepting
                the principle of the best man or woman for the job. The 1998
                Northern Ireland Act, in the relevant sections, discussed
                equality of opportunity. Equality of opportunity need not mean
                — and this is a crucial distinction — equality of outcome.
                This has been the subject of much ideological and political
                debate in many countries throughout the last century. This was a
                debate between liberal democracy, where value is ultimately
                placed on equality of opportunity and freedom, and totalitarian
                systems of politics, where attempts were made in vain to have
                everyone on the same level.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Public policy designed to create equality of
                opportunity should be directed towards individuals rather than
                geographical regions. It is individuals who are poor, unemployed
                or disadvantaged, not patches of ground. The key thing in the
                labour market , which is the specific point of this motion, is
                recruitment on merit. It is worth noting that even if
                recruitment is on merit — where the best person gets the job
                in every case — this could still be compatible with an
                unemployment rate differential between the two main sections of
                our community, or indeed with perceived imbalances in the
                percentage composition of employment in given enterprises.
                Chapter 5 of the report, which the proposer of the motion
                emphasised, shows the figures for recruitment inflow into jobs.
                We can see that in 1999 48% of all public sector appointments
                went to Catholics and 46% of private sector appointments
                likewise.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In both cases this represented more than the
                relevant share of the available labour force. This does not, of
                itself, prove discrimination or unfairness, but it is at least a
                cause for concern. It may be argued from some of the Benches
                that, in some sense, positive discrimination is justifiable to
                rectify a perceived historical wrong. However, there are at
                least three main responses to such an argument.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first is a historical reply. How much
                actual and systematic discrimination against Catholics was there
                under the old Stormont Administration? There has been a huge
                debate on that issue among historians, economists, sociologists
                and others, and the result is by no means clear. Secondly, there
                is a moral reply. One should not try to put right one wrong by
                making another one today. Thirdly and lastly, there is a legal
                response. Positive discrimination is plainly illegal under
                current fair employment law. Where it is happening, that is
                wrong, and it is a legitimate cause for concern on the part of
                the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given the specific evidence in chapter&nbsp;5
                of the report, which was highlighted by the proposer of the
                motion, and given the evidence on recruitment flows, I support
                this motion. Thank you.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Lewsley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I oppose this motion, and in doing so I will
                attempt to dispel the myths surrounding equality in employment
                in Northern Ireland — myths, sadly, that Mr&nbsp;Campbell
                seems intent on repeating today. In his motion, Mr&nbsp;Campbell
                spuriously attempts to imply that Catholics have somehow
                received special treatment in Northern Ireland at the expense of
                Protestants. That is not only untrue, it is demonstrably untrue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A myth linked to equality in employment is
                the claim that all new jobs go to Catholics. While the net
                increase in jobs is similar to the increase in the number of
                Catholics in the workforce, this in no way means that all new
                jobs have actually gone to Catholics. There is absolutely no
                evidence of discrimination in the jobs’ market. This can be
                illustrated by looking at the applicant to appointee rates. In
                1999, 44·7% of public sector applicants were Catholic, and
                44·4% of these were appointed; in the private sector Catholic
                applicants were 46·5%, with 46·2% appointees. It is
                interesting to note that the job applicants tend to be young,
                and the proportion of Catholics among the young is higher than
                among the workforce as a whole. Also, there are more Catholics
                who are unemployed and, therefore, applying for jobs and, as
                should be expected, getting jobs. The main problem is the
                under-representation in the Senior Civil Service where, of 232
                staff, only 50 are Catholics.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even if the Civil Service’s own targets are
                realised, which is unlikely, the figure would only rise to 30%
                by 2006. The SDLP favours setting up a review in this area to
                see how progress can be speeded up. There is also acute
                under-representation of Catholics in securityrelated
                occupations. The Catholic population is 42% of the workforce.
                When Senior Civil Service posts and security occupations are
                excluded, that percentage rises to 44% — slightly higher —
                but most of those jobs are lower paid ones held by women. There
                is a higher proportion of women in the workforce, 42%. It is to
                be expected that if Catholics will not apply for
                security-related jobs, then they will apply for the lower paid
                jobs. The SDLP has, therefore, called for the new police service
                to be subject to quotas on recruitment, and for it to be
                possible to keep the quota in place for more than 10&nbsp;years.
                The Government has agreed to this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have called for a guarantee that the quota
                will be kept in place for 10&nbsp;years, and that it will apply
                to police support staff. As the Police Bill stands, it will only
                apply where there are 10&nbsp;similar posts available at the
                same time. This will never happen. The SDLP agrees with the
                Equality Commission that it should apply where there are two
                similar posts.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main function of fair employment
                legislation is to eliminate discrimination in the employment and
                dismissal of employees. Not one single element of fair
                employment law can be held up by Mr Campbell to demonstrate that
                such laws discriminate against Protestants. Put simply, fair
                employment laws are religion neutral. They favour neither
                Catholic, Protestant, Sikh nor Muslim, so reform of the fair
                employment laws is quite unnecessary.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If, as Mr Campbell claims, there is an
                underrepresentation of Protestants, perfectly adequate measures
                already exist to address that, the same measures that would be
                applied if there were an under-representation of Catholics or of
                any other religion in Northern Ireland. Fair employment
                legislation does allow for some affirmative action to be taken
                in order to achieve a balanced workforce: encouraging applicants
                from under-represented communities; revising redundancy
                policies; providing training for the long-term unemployed; and
                so on. However, none of those measures discriminates. The
                principle of employing the best person to do the job still holds
                true.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Campbell has previously cited
                over-representation of Catholics on Newry and Mourne District
                Council and Down District Council. These councils have taken
                affirmative action measures to redress this imbalance. I note
                that he failed to mention those councils which are not dealing
                with this issue, for example, Castlereagh Borough Council.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Equality Commission was established as
                part of the Good Friday Agreement, and it espoused equality for
                all. I propose that we do not support this motion.</p>

                heard very clearly on this side of the House what appeared to be
                a threat from the hon Member, Conor Murphy. He asked someone on
                this side of the House if he was going to make him sit down. In
                everyday parlance outside the House that sort of language is
                normally associated with aggressive, corner-boy tactics and a
                punch-up.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Madam Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not aware that such a remark was made. I
                will check Hansard and come back.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">DUP Members would recognise corner-boy
                tactics since it is chiefly they who use them in the Chamber.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Anyway, with regard to the motion from the
                &quot;flat-earth society&quot;, Mr Campbell’s argument about
                applicants and appointees asks us to ignore all the
                discrimination of the past 80 years and just deal with today —
                forget about everything that has gone before, just deal with
                today. It also ignores the fact that the age group most likely
                to be applying for jobs at the moment is different from that of
                what he refers to as the overall population. I think that he is
                referring to the 1991 census. He also asks us to ignore the
                recent statistics which show that Catholics in that age group
                are better qualified. Finally, he asks us to ignore the Equality
                Commission’s report and its interpretation of that report and
                deal with the Gregory Campbell interpretation instead. The
                Equality Commission has said that one of its key challenges is
                the continuing under-representation of Catholics at senior
                grades in the Civil Service. Mr Campbell obviously knows the
                report better than the commission does.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Overall, Protestant male employment has gone
                down by 0·7%, and Protestant female employment has stayed the
                same. The only statistics that I could see that reflected any of
                that was in the section on standard occupational classification
                six, which deals with personal and protective services and
                employment in the security industry. Indeed, Catholics only make
                up 27·4% of the employees in this area. A possible reason for
                the marginal downturn of Protestant employment in this sector
                may be that a large number of RUC officers are availing
                themselves of early retirement, in comparison with the number
                being recruited.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr McClelland] in the
                Chair)</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The argument has been made that the
                representation of Catholics in the workforce in the public
                sector now reflects their proportion of the economically active
                population. There are a number of points to be made: this
                excludes the security-related occupations; it ignores the fact
                that Catholics are employed in the lower levels of the public
                sector; it ignores the large numbers who are economically
                inactive; and it ignores the fact that a younger Catholic
                workforce is coming on stream, while the Protestant workforce
                reflects an ageing population.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report does not examine where the minute
                increases in Catholic employment or the minute decreases in
                Protestant employment are the result of natural wastage in the
                workforce, for example, where more Protestants are retiring than
                Catholics. The report needs a broader analysis of occupational
                classification such as tenure or duration of employment to get a
                real picture of the employment differential. The 1997 labour
                force survey states that the unemployment rate for Catholics is
                12% as opposed to 5% for Protestants. In my constituency of
                Newry and Armagh it is 15% for Catholics as opposed to 2·9% for
                Protestants. The agency describes the unemployment rate for
                Catholics as being substantially higher than for Protestants,
                but says that the Government are committed to narrowing the gap.
                It is worrying that some of the recent attempts to undermine the
                unemployment differential as a measure of disadvantage and
                discrimination have come from the Office of the First and the
                Deputy First Minister. We will continue to be very vigilant
                about this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the Equality Commission ignored
                the attacks on the unemployment differential as a measure of

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An analysis of the report of the Equality
                Commission shows that over a period of 10 years very significant
                progress was made on the historic imbalance in the employment
                for Catholics.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is something to be welcomed rather than
                criticised or belittled. It is progress that has been made in
                our society, and it is important for us to reflect on the fact
                that progress has been made since the introduction of the Fair
                Employment (Northern Ireland) Act 1989. The preceding Fair
                Employment (Northern Ireland) Act 1976 had very little power,
                and between that period and 1990 the situation for Catholics at
                work did not improve very much.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This shows the effect of the determination of
                the Fair Employment Agency and the Fair Employment Commission to
                tackle the problem of employment for Catholics since that time,
                and that is something to be celebrated rather than criticised.
                In some areas there are still significant deficiencies. If one
                looks, for example, at the heavy engineering industry in
                Belfast, one can see considerable under-representation of
                Catholics. The same is true in the security forces and in the
                higher levels of the Civil Service. This motion is trying to
                cherry-pick one aspect to show that the Protestant community is
                suffering from some form of reverse discrimination. That is
                absolute nonsense, and when one looks at the figures, and at the
                totality of this report, one can see quite clearly that that is
                not happening.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me take issue with Mr&nbsp;Campbell, who
                talked about &quot;the simple cliché of Catholic
                unemployment&quot;. How insulting can one get? Anybody who is
                unemployed suffers. Nobody is unemployed because he wants to be,
                and anyone who is unemployed is suffering serious disadvantage.
                To belittle people and to belittle that section of the community
                and refer to them as a simple cliché is outrageous. For any
                responsible Member of this House to use that sort of language to
                insult people is something to be deplored by all Members of this
                House. I hope that Mr&nbsp;Campbell will withdraw that remark,
                because it is a searing insult to people and seriously damaging.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When one looks at the overall situation in
                Northern Ireland and at the continuing problem of the
                over-representation of Catholics within the unemployed sector,
                one has to address that and ask why we have this historic
                problem. I believe that new TSN is one way of addressing it.
                There is no point in our coming to the House and bemoaning the
                problem — we have to have policies that will direct the
                attention of the Administration and public services to
                eradicating it. That is something with which we can all agree,
                because there would be a net benefit for the whole community. I
                look forward to the day when there is full employment in this
                community and when this unseemly scrabble over statistics on
                imbalances in the workplace is finally put to rest.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome both the report and the debate.
                Even though we tend to disagree, it is healthy that we discuss
                these important matters. In an earlier debate I stated that
                equality means different things to different people. I can now
                say the same thing about the statistics in the Equality
                Commission’s report. Statistics can be interpreted in many
                ways depending on the reader and what they wish to extract from
                them. Indeed, as I am sure everyone knows, Mark Twain referred
                to them as</p>

                should be that the Devil can quote the Scripture for his own.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report was actually quite heartening,
                particularly from the point of view that jobs in all sectors
                appear to be more accessible to all job seekers in Northern
                Ireland. Concerns on the issues of gender and religious
                persuasion have been, and are continuing to be, addressed. One
                of my principal concerns on the issue of monitoring is that it
                does not seem to take into account that it is still very
                difficult, if not impossible, to employ people in areas of
                Northern Ireland where they do not feel comfortable. Some
                people, because of gender, religion, race or ability, do not
                feel comfortable and perhaps do not feel safe, not just in the
                workplace itself, but also in travelling to and from their place
                of work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we examine the tables in chapters three,
                four and five of the report, which outline the composition of
                authorities, public and private sector bodies and appointments
                to them, they confirm the fact that in some areas the situation
                somehow determines the make-up of the workforce. We must try to
                read such a report objectively.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have also been particularly heartened by
                the increase in female employment, not only in the traditional
                service areas, but also in public sector management. I have
                examined the tables and figures given in the report,
                particularly those relating to the public sector, which appear
                to cause Mr&nbsp;Campbell concern. I do not see any substantial
                evidence to suggest that his views are completely right. The
                report states that an increase in the participation of Catholics
                in the workforce was approximately half of one percent each year
                over the ten years of the monitoring. I do not think that that
                is too worrying.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Protestants continue to be fairly represented
                in Northern Ireland’s workforce and still find themselves in
                the majority in many sectors. The statistics, of course, do not
                show an increase in the percentage representation of Catholics
                in various sectors. However, after years of gross
                under-representation of Catholic people in our workforce, at
                least progress has been made towards achieving a just and
                balanced situation. Therefore, these figures should be warmly
                welcomed instead of being used to set off alarm bells. However,
                I say to Mr Campbell, if alarm bells are set off, the Equality
                Commission should be asked to account for that. Mr Campbell is
                actually implying that there is — positive though it may be
                — religious discrimination against Protestants. As another
                Member stated, this is illegal and it should be dealt with. I
                hope that Mr Campbell will be taking that matter to the
                Commission.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All in all, I am glad to see that in both the
                public and private sectors there is redress in the balance of
                Catholic workers. It is noted that there is still concern with
                respect to the percentage representation of Catholics in the
                security sector, but let us hope that this too will be reduced
                and not necessarily through quotas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There should never be tokenism of a religious
                or a gender nature, and I think the report shows that that is
                not the case. The Civil Service, as has been mentioned, also
                needs to look at the gender and religious background of its
                senior grades. I hope, as a member of the Commission, that all
                our recruitment procedures will be open, transparent and
                accessible and fair to all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Beneficial as these statistics may be in
                monitoring Northern Ireland’s workforce, I long to see the day
                that the focus will be taken away from whether an employee is
                Catholic or Protestant; male or female; able or disabled, or is
                of any particular race. Instead, I hope that jobs are awarded to
                candidates on merit alone. I hope that one day a person will be
                capable of proving him or herself the best candidate for a job
                just for being the person they are, and not for what the
                statistics say they should be. I cannot support the motion.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. When the Government are
                faced with the issue of equality they can take one of two
                routes. Either they can support equality of opportunity for all,
                which is the correct route, or they can try to eliminate the
                unemployment differential between the two main communities. That
                is clearly the route which the SDLP is going down in supporting
                quotas in the RUC. Unfortunately, that has been the net effect
                of the fair employment legislation over the last 25&nbsp;years.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Member give way?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Weir:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, I have only five&nbsp;minutes,
                so I shall not give way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If one compares employment statistics from
                1971 onwards, one will find that the Catholic share of the
                workforce in 1971 was about 29%. It is now nearly 40%. The
                number of Protestants in employment now compared with 1971 is
                down by roughly 15,000. The number of Catholics in employment
                has risen by about 84,000. Yet in spite of this large increase,
                in both actual and percentage terms, a differential gap remains
                with regard to the number of Catholics employed. As has been
                claimed by some other Members, such a gap does not mean that
                there is employment inequality, for while the Catholic
                percentage share of employment has increased throughout that
                period, it has constantly been chasing a moving target,
                particularly because of birth-rate differentials and other
                factors.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also question whether the figure of 39·6%
                for the Catholic share of the workforce is correct, since it is
                based on public-sector employees and those in private-sector
                firms employing more than 25&nbsp;people. Indeed, if one
                compares the 1991 figure with the census figure, one will find
                that about 170,000&nbsp;people are not included. These,
                generally speaking, are people employed in small firms. Figures
                suggest that they have a higher Catholic recruitment rate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I should like to move to the substance of the
                motion. The statistics tell us a number of things. First, in
                public-sector recruitment figures for nine of the last
                10&nbsp;years, the percentage of Catholics appointed was higher
                than their share of the workforce, and in the one year when it
                was not, it was more or less the same. In the private sector,
                this was true for each of the last 10 years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us break that down using another
                statistic. I have carried out a little research on this. There
                were 37&nbsp;public bodies in 1997 with a higher percentage of
                Catholic employees than their share of the workforce,
                41&nbsp;with a higher percentage of Protestants than one might
                expect. Using these statistics, how have they performed since
                1997? Of the 37 public-sector bodies with a disproportionately
                high number of Roman Catholics, in 24 cases the percentage of
                Catholic employment has actually risen. In only 10 of them has
                it gone down.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of the 41 public bodies with a
                disproportionately high number of Protestants, the percentage of
                Catholics in 1999 rose in 29 and decreased in nine. There were
                23 bodies with a disproportionately high number of Roman
                Catholics in 1991. Of those, 17 had actually increased their
                percentage of Roman Catholics by 1999. Of the five where that
                percentage decreased, in only one case was it by more than 2%.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The same can be seen on the Protestant side,
                where 32 public bodies had a disproportionately high number of
                Protestants. The Catholic percentage has increased in 27 of them
                and decreased in only three. We are seeing a two-tier reaction
                on fair employment. Where there is a disproportionately high
                number of Catholics in the public sector, that number is
                increasing. Where there is a disproportionately high number of
                Protestants, it is decreasing. Those statistics clearly show
                that there is discrimination.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the broad sectors of health
                and education, where there has been a disproportionately high
                number of Catholics, that percentage has increased. In the other
                sectors where there is a disproportionately high number of
                Protestants, it has decreased. This clearly shows
                discrimination.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I urge Members to support the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dallat:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many years ago, when the SDLP campaigned for
                funding for the Fair Employment Agency it was very much opposed
                by the DUP. I am delighted to see so many copies of the equal
                opportunities report tonight — that is progress.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I once read a paperback called ‘How to Lie
                with Statistics’. It is an absolute must for the politician
                who wants to make a case out of nothing. I threw it away because
                I want to live in the real world — not the world of
                make-believe.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For years I followed with interest Mr
                Campbell’s claims of discrimination in his native city, and I
                often wondered if he was really genuine in his quest for fair
                employment. My wishes were granted when he got the DUP
                nomination for East Derry — mind you, the local papers are
                still talking about the statistics for that. He won the seat,
                and I was glad. This was because I hoped he would bring with him
                the strong anti-discriminatory principles he has been telling us
                about all these years. But not a bit of it. Indeed, I suggest he
                would defend to the death the high moral ground of those
                employers in his new constituency who have serious problems
                redressing the imbalance in their workforces but stubbornly
                refuse to carry in their advertisements the ice-breaker &quot;We
                are equal opportunities employers&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is the problem with statistics. You can
                add them, multiply them, or do what you like with them. You can
                say the tank is half empty or half full, depending on whether
                you are a pessimist or an optimist. Unfortunately, Catholic male
                unemployment is still twice as high as that for Protestants.
                Over the last ten years the figures in the public service have
                not changed significantly. There is a slight fall in Protestant
                representation, matched by a slight increase in Catholic
                percentages — that is all. In local government, taking an
                average of all 26 councils, 63.4% of all employees are still
                designated as Protestant. In several categories Catholics are
                particularly under-represented, especially in the higher grades.
                In the four worst councils, the average percentage of Catholic
                employment is less than 8%.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nevertheless, there has been improvement, and
                all right-thinking people should be encouraged by that progress
                because in the end every one is a winner. When genuine equality
                has been established, the old system of begging for a job on the
                basis of religion, rather than ability and skills to do the job,
                will be gone, and this country will have come of age. Fair
                employment legislation is no longer peculiar to Northern
                Ireland. We may have pioneered it out of necessity, but it is
                now common practice for countries all over the world to monitor
                performance figures, not only on grounds of religion but on
                gender, age, disability and all the other categories listed in
                the Equality Commission’s report. That is nothing more than
                common sense and good practice. The figures Mr Campbell quotes
                are cleverly selected to make a case were there is none, but I
                am not suggesting that he has been reading my book &quot;How to
                Lie with Statistics&quot;. However, he could well have written
                it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fair employment is still an emotive term. It
                whips up fears and encourages prejudices. Fair employment
                legislation is just as important for the Protestant community as
                it is for the Catholic community. All persons are entitled to
                have their rights protected. Let us work the legislation by
                keeping our attention focused on real politics. Let us work
                together in harmony so that new high paid, skilled jobs are
                created and no one is unemployed or made to hold down jobs which
                require lower skills than they have. That is the work faced by
                politicians in the future, and that is what we should be about,
                rather than living in the past, which failed everyone and
                benefited no one. No one in their right mind condones
                discrimination against Protestants; there is nothing to be had
                in reversing the roles.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, the motion is divisive and
                that is regrettable because it denies the Assembly the
                opportunity to speak with one voice on a subject that is common
                to everyone. The SDLP in no way condones discrimination against
                any group of people and we are seriously concerned that Mr
                Campbell will be successful in creating a chill factor among
                Protestants. That is precisely what happened in Down Council
                where a DUP member made claims of discrimination where there
                were none and created a problem as a result of his claims. I am
                totally against the motion, and I am sorry it was discussed here
                at all.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat. I have listened with
                interest to the contributions made here on the issue of equality
                of employment, and I have to say that if this issue were not so
                serious, comments made by those on the Unionist benches would be
                laughable. For eighty years, since the inception of this state,
                discrimination has been carried out wholesale on the Nationalist
                community. For years, your name and the school you attended were
                more of an indication of your ability to do a job than your
                qualifications. When hundreds of young Catholics boarded boats
                and planes in search of employment, the shipyard in Belfast was
                employing men on the basis that their father, brother or uncle
                had worked there before them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now, after years of work in the community,
                intense lobbying by Nationalist representatives and the Irish
                Government, and international pressure, due in no small part to
                the MacBride principles, we have finally got legislation in
                place to try to address this. However, there is no getting away
                from the fact that Catholics are still more likely to be
                unemployed than Protestants in the Six Counties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are now hearing about studies being
                carried by Unionist advisors who are attempting to redefine the
                criteria for ranking deprivation. Attempts are being made to
                devise a formula to find the pockets of deprivation complained
                of by the UUP and DUP. The consequence of this will be that
                pockets of deprivation will be given ranking equivalence to ward
                upon ward of deprived Nationalist and Republican communities.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No, I do not have enough time. Everyone knows
                that the argument that the UUP and DUP have made over pockets of
                deprivation amidst affluence having some sort of equivalence to
                wards of multiple deprivation has no theoretical basis in social
                science. However, it is likely to be presented in such a way as
                to suggest it does. This attempt to equalise or neutralise
                deprivation fails when one examines statistical evidence in
                constituencies like Fermanagh and South Tyrone, where Catholic
                unemployment stands at 13.3% compared to 3.9% Protestant
                unemployment. Republicans have concerns that the Office of the
                First Minister and Deputy First Minister is not seriously
                addressing equality matters. Indeed, it is not just Republicans
                but many Nationalists who regard high ranking civil servants and
                advisors as people who wield too much influence over the future
                of the equality agenda, especially when one of those advisors
                has already stated his ‘religious blind’ approach when
                dealing with equality matters. This approach is in direct
                conflict with affirmative action programmes, action plans and
                timetables.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Examining latest labour force survey reports,
                which are the most recent available statistic denoting long-term
                unemployment, one finds that the survey for 1997 revealed an
                alarming differential of 2.9% for Catholic males when compared
                to Protestant males. Such a figure was the highest differential
                since the 1960’s. Furthermore, page 9 of the most recently
                published labour force survey report states quite clearly that
                Catholic males have been typically twice as likely as Protestant
                males to be unemployed. Yet, we hear Mr Campbell refer to the
                worsening under-representation of the Protestant community,
                particularly relating to the public sector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since this statelet was artificially created,
                its over-representation by the Protestant community has been
                well documented. The statelet has been policed by one section of
                the community, and has also been serviced by that same
                Protestant community in the Civil Service. Therefore, one of the
                many problems that the Equality Commission needs to address,
                urgently, is the religious and gender composition of the Civil
                Service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Attention must be given to the fact that
                there is still an under-representation of Catholics throughout
                the service, especially at the higher levels. There is a need
                for an urgent review of its compositional make-up. While noting
                how few Catholics are employed, consideration also needs to be
                given to how few women are employed, and how few of them hold
                managerial and professional positions in the standard
                occupational classification ranking.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If such data were examined, Mr Campbell would
                learn that it is the under-representation of the Catholic
                community and the over-representation of the Protestant
                community that must be dealt with. Sinn Féin asks the Equality
                Commission to address this matter urgently.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not support the motion. Go raibh maith

                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Nesbitt:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have listened carefully to Members on both
                sides of the House, and I would like to begin by making some
                general comments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First of all, equality is at the heart of the
                Good Friday Agreement. It must be applied to both communities
                and in an even-handed way. By recruiting only on merit, we are
                doing just that. The right man or woman should secure the job
                solely on that basis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Equality Commission’s report, its
                tenth, makes a valuable contribution to the understanding of
                what is a very sensitive issue for both the Catholic and
                Protestant communities. Is there or is there not discrimination?
                Is there or is there not fair employment? Is there or is there
                not fair promotion? Is there or is there not fair recruitment?
                These are very sensitive issues to both communities. Therefore,
                as I said on 6 June when I last spoke on the subject, I will
                measure my words carefully. I will endeavour, Mr Deputy Speaker,
                to stand over every word I say.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As always with statistics, they need to be
                read and interpreted very carefully and not quoted ambiguously.
                There are structural changes we must be aware of — for
                example, the age structure of the population. There is a higher
                proportion of the younger age group in the Catholic community.
                Also, immigration, emigration and birth rates are different with
                respect to the Catholic and Protestant communities. These
                factors must be considered in the analysis of the statistics.
                The key test is, as noted, applicants and appointees, and how
                they move into employment. They may come from the unemployed or
                from the inactive population. They may be students or mothers
                who were not working and now seek work. Those entering
                employment come from different sources. Therefore, it is never
                easy to draw conclusions about the differential aspects of
                unemployment and about whether there is fairness in employment.
                Everything must be carefully analysed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I mentioned the unemployment differential. I
                am conscious that Mr Campbell refers to the underrepresentation
                of Protestants, the corollary of that being the vast increase in
                work for Catholics that is seen to be happening in Northern
                Ireland. I want to make it clear: there are more Catholics
                unemployed. If more Catholics are unemployed there is more
                disadvantage. If there are more Catholics unemployed and they
                are all seeking work and are all equally qualified, and if we
                are working on the merit principle then it follows that, on a
                proportionate basis, more Catholics would be getting jobs than
                Protestants. That is not detrimental to the merit principle or
                to equality of opportunity, and it is not unfair. Therefore, we
                must be very careful in our analysis of the statistics. I will
                not say any more about the unemployment differential, and I have
                to tell Mr&nbsp;Conor&nbsp;Murphy that I will stand over the
                comments I have made on the subject.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me now deal with the point in the motion
                about the worsening under-representation of the Protestant
                community. As I said, statistics are to be interpreted
                carefully. Therefore, I cannot support Mr Campbell’s motion.
                In my view, the jury is out on it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me just give one or two statistics. The
                Protestant workforce is 60.4%, but 58% of the available
                workforce is from the Protestant community. Therefore, the
                proportion in work is higher than that available for work from
                the Protestant community. The private sector employs 60.2% of
                Protestants, but the public sector employs 61%. Remember,
                Protestants make up 58% of those available for work. I know Mr
                Campbell quotes Government statistics, but there is a difficulty
                with Government statistics. Government statistics from the
                Department of Finance and Personnel state that the number of
                applicants from 1996 to 1998 from the Protestant community was
                46.7% while 51.5% of those appointed were Protestant. These
                statistics are not exactly the same as those in the monitoring
                report from the Fair Employment Commission or the Equal
                Opportunities Commission.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have two sets of statistics that say a
                slightly different thing. Let me just give you one of the
                reasons for the difference. The Equality Commission’s report
                stated that if one person applied ten times for a job, it would
                count as one application. However, the Department of Finance and
                Personnel, if one person applied ten times, would count it as
                ten applications — a totally different basis for the
                statistics, yet both are, to use Mr Campbell’s words,
                &quot;Government statistics&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes, there are statistics and selective
                statistics. Mr Campbell referred to health and education. You
                could equally refer to the Equality Commission’s report on
                district councils. According to page 54, 56.8% of the district
                councils were Protestant, as were 58.1% of those who were
                appointed, so there are statistics and statistics. I cannot
                support the precise wording of Mr&nbsp;Campbell’s motion. It
                criticises the worsening under-representation, and the jury is
                still out on that.</p>

                derive directly from the statistics. Protestants make up 58% of

                Protestant share of the workforce is currently 60·4%. That is
                2·4% higher than their numbers in the available workforce. In

                workforce. In the public sector, they make up 61%. In the
                Northern Ireland Civil Service between 1996 and 1998, 46·7% of
                applications were from Protestants, and that resulted in their

                of the Civil Service there are 232 staff, of whom 50 are
                Catholics: 21·5% of the workforce. Only one Northern Ireland
                Civil Service category has an under-representation of the
                Protestant community. That is the 114 careers officers. When
                monitoring began in 1990, Catholics made up 34·9% of the
                workforce. In 1999 they were assessed at 39·6%. That is an
                encouraging increase, but it still falls short of the 42% of the

                is possible through the courts, affirmative action is also
                possible. We in the SDLP would have liked to see a great deal
                more of that, but as certain people will have learned over the
                last 30 years, you cannot get all that you want. The affirmative
                action that we would have liked to see does not extend to the
                sort of measures that I thought —wrongly, I am afraid — I
                had in front of me.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moving on, I agree emphatically with my
                Colleague Alban Maginness about TSN. Research indicates that a
                number of factors cause relative deprivation in the Catholic
                community and give rise to greater difficulty in gaining
                employment. The Catholic community has a younger age structure.
                There is reluctance on the part of Catholics to seek employment
                in security-related occupations. There is a higher proportion of
                Catholics in the lower socio-economic groups where unemployment
                is highest. A higher proportion of Catholic than Protestant
                families have large numbers of children. That is a very telling
                point. In both communities, families with large numbers of
                children are more prone to unemployment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That brings me to an important point about
                new TSN. New TSN targets social disadvantage. We hope that that
                will lead to an erosion of the differentials in unemployment
                between the two communities, not because it discriminates in
                favour of the Catholic community but because it targets social
                disadvantage. Targeting social disadvantage helps those, both
                Protestant and Catholic, who happen to be socially
                disadvantaged, and therefore it is a non-discriminatory attack
                on the reasons for the differential in unemployment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have very little time left, but I would
                like to ask Mr&nbsp;Campbell a question. I hope he will answer.
                I do not want him to evade it. There are people in the DUP, and
                further afield, who believe that Protestants are currently being
                unfairly treated in the labour market. There are many people in
                my party, and in other parties, who believe that there is a
                continuing problem with fair employment and that the
                difficulties lie disproportionately on the Catholic side of the
                community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can we agree on one simple conclusion from
                all of this — that there is a difficulty with fair employment?
                That says to me that we need the toughest and the strongest
                possible legislation to outlaw discrimination in employment.
                Does Mr&nbsp;Campbell agree with me on that? We need the
                toughest and the strongest possible Government agencies to deal
                with the problem of inequality in education and with
                discrimination where it exists. We need to monitor the whole
                situation so that the Government can take appropriate measures.
                Predictably, but regrettably, Sinn Féin Members tried to lay
                blame on the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister in relation to these matters. I regret that their
                concern about fair employment did not extend to their Colleagues

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I think that a period of cool, calm
                reflection is required, and I hope I will be able to bring
                something of that to the debate. I will try to deal with some of
                the issues that were raised.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In dealing with the factual position
                underlining and underpinning the motion, I had hoped that those
                who oppose it would have had some substance to their argument. I
                had hoped that they might not revert to hyperbole, to emotive
                phrases and to simplistic catchphrases. I had hoped that would
                be the case, but I am afraid to say that I have been
                disappointed. However, when a community and a series of public
                representatives are faced with cold, hard facts that they may
                want to quibble about, that they may want to dodge, that they
                may want to try to avoid or evade and cannot, then they have to
                resort to clichés. I had hoped that they might actually engage
                in the substance of the debate, but sadly, all too often this
                was not the case. Ms&nbsp;Lewsley made reference to the numbers
                of unemployed, and she is right of course. Proportionately there
                are more unemployed Roman Catholics than Protestants, but there
                is an underlying assumption that the 125,000 people who applied
                for jobs in the public sector all came from the ranks of the
                unemployed. Why should people assume that this is the case? Of
                course it is not the case. A sizeable number of them may be, but
                not all of those applying for jobs in the public sector are
                unemployed. To imply that the unemployment ratio should be used
                as a benchmark against which the numbers of public sector
                applicants are assessed really is a nonsense. I hope I have
                dealt with that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not going to give credibility to those
                who represent terrorism by naming them, but several Nationalist
                Members had the breathtaking hypocrisy to mention that the
                security-related sector has to be taken into account — I
                thought they would have avoided it like the plague. These
                people, who for 30 years have advised Catholics not to take jobs
                in the security-related sector, are now saying that Catholics
                are under-represented in the security-related field.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Campbell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is what I meant by &quot;breathtaking
                hypocrisy&quot;. They were advised not to take positions in the
                security sector, and the small number from the Roman Catholic
                community who did were intimidated. Members, some of whom are
                associated with the organisation that did the intimidating, are
                now getting to their feet and saying that there are very few
                Catholics in the security sector. There are very few Catholics
                in that sector because their affiliates shot them when they did
                work in it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SDLP does not escape blame. Since 1972 it
                has advocated that the Catholic community should not take up
                employment with the RUC, the UDR or the Royal Irish Regiment,
                yet many SDLP Members have asked tonight, as a defence, about
                the security-related sector. The position in the
                security-related sector would have been much better if the SDLP
                had advocated that its community should join. They are
                responsible for the under-representation of Catholics in the
                security-related sector, although not as much as the IRA, which
                shot people when they did come forward from the Catholic
                community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr&nbsp;Weir for his reference to the
                differential gap. At the outset I referred to the cliché about
                Catholics being more likely to be unemployed than Protestants.
                Certain people seem to have a blind spot, because statistics
                available in the Irish Republic show that Catholics in Counties
                Donegal and Monaghan are three times more likely to be
                unemployed than Protestants. Is that because of discrimination?
                If it is, what are the Dublin Government doing about it? That
                situation cannot be because of a Government agency, a conspiracy
                or a sense of paranoia in the establishment in Dublin to deprive
                the good Catholics of Monaghan and Donegal of employment. The
                reasons for such a situation in the Irish Republic need to be
                addressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">References were made to the principle of
                equality, and I was amazed at the junior Minister,
                Mr&nbsp;Nesbitt, referring to equality being at the heart of the
                Good Friday Agreement. If equality is at the heart of the
                agreement then we will see within a week the terms of that
                equality. If the Unionist community is demonstrated to be
                opposed to this agreement, and if a greater number of Unionists
                is against this agreement than for it, then there will have to
                be a fundamental reassessment if equality is at the heart of it.
                However, that is a matter for next week, and I will not proceed
                down that avenue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The other junior Minister, Mr&nbsp;Haughey,
                referred to the overall workforce breakdown, and my concluding
                remarks will deal with that.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">8.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is somewhat confusing for the average
                layperson hearing these figures being bandied about to come to
                terms with the overall principle underpinning the motion. That
                is why I attempted to keep it as general as possible and why I
                studiously avoided being selective, despite the accusations. If
                we look at tables 41 and 42 on pages&nbsp;47 and 48 of the tenth
                annual monitoring report, we see that 55% of public-sector
                applications are from Protestants, but only 52% of all
                appointees are Protestant. People can avoid, evade or dodge
                that. They can try to get under it, climb over it, or get round
                it, but they will have to face up to it eventually. That is
                equality at work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Protestant community is demanding true
                equality. As of the tenth annual monitoring report, it does not
                have that. People can try to take us up a sidetrack or bring us
                into bypath meadow, but they cannot evade the central issue —
                the Protestant community’s under-representation in the public
                sector in Northern Ireland.</p>

                that the public and Members may be clear. Look at the higher
                echelons of the public sector in Northern Ireland. The higher
                the echelon, the smaller are the numbers of Protestants gaining
                employment. That is what the facts say. One cannot deny the
                facts; one cannot avoid them. That is what they say. The lower
                the grade in the public sector, the more likely it is that
                Protestants are employed there. The reality is the reverse of
                the propaganda.</p>

                the question. Does all of this mean that we need the strongest

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the point raised by Mr&nbsp;Haughey,
                a lack of tough legislation is not the issue. The issue is how
                that legislation is being implemented when it comes down to
                Mr&nbsp;Weir’s point about under-representation in either
                section of the community. Is there equal validity being given to
                the under-representation of Catholics in a workforce, as there
                is to the under-representation of Protestants in a workforce.
                The reality is that there is not. There is not the same emphasis
                or resources being deployed to deal with under-representation of
                Protestants, as I made clear at the outset.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Equality Commission, the Government and
                the previous Fair Employment Commission based the whole
                rationale for their fair-employment legislation on the fact that
                Catholics are more likely to be unemployed than Protestants.
                They will not move away from that underlying principle. Until
                they do, we will be in an awkward position.</p>

                clear. It is not the lack of legislation; it is how that
                legislation is being implemented. If, despite the effective
                legislation that is on the statute book, the Equality Commission
                can devote its time and resources to dealing with the
                under-representation of Catholics in certain sectors of the
                workforce but will not devote time and resources to dealing with
                the under-representation of Protestants in certain sectors of
                the workforce, the problem is not the legislation; the problem
                rests with those who are implementing it. The equality of the
                implementation of that legislation is what is at the heart of
                this motion.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Member agree that a further
                statistic which shows the level of discrimination against the
                Protestant community in terms of employment in recent years is
                that, because of the improving economic situation since 1991,
                Protestant employment has risen by only 11%, whereas Catholic
                employment has risen by 36%?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank my hon Friend for that statistic. It
                certainly makes a point. It illustrates how those who raise the
                old bogey-stories about the breakdown of the workforces from
                years ago — are trying deliberately to miss the point. The
                point we are making in this motion is that we must talk about
                the flow of workforces, the appointees and the applicants. That
                is what tells us what is happening in the workforce now — in
                the year 2000. That is the important issue — not employment
                levels in 1962 or in the 1970s and 1980s. We need to know what
                is happening now. That is what will form the basis for the
                future breakdowns of all our workforces. That is why this motion
                needs support from this House. That is why the Equality
                Commission needs to act to stem the flow and halt the
                under-representation of Protestant applicants and appointees in
                the public sector.</p>
