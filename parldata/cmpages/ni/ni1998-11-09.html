                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By virtue of paragraph 1 of the schedule to
                the Northern Ireland (Elections) Act 1998, it falls to the
                Secretary of State to determine where and when meetings of the
                Assembly shall be held. I have received from the Secretary of
                State a letter directing that the Assembly shall meet at
                Parliament Buildings, Stormont at 10.30 am on Monday
                2&nbsp;November until 6.00 pm on Monday 30&nbsp;November.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the last sitting, there was comment
                about remarks allegedly made by some Members, and I was asked to
                give a number of rulings. I have studied the Official Report and
                have listened to sections of the tape recording of proceedings.
                I have also taken advice on certain matters. Neither the
                Official Report nor the tapes of proceedings picked up any
                comments of the kind alleged to have been made by
                Rev&nbsp;William&nbsp;McCrea. Remarks made by some Members
                sailed a little close to the wind, and I request Members to
                observe more closely the courtesies and respect due in the
                Chamber.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the case of some other interventions, I
                have issued formal, written cautions to those concerned, and I
                must advise the House that repetition of such transgressions
                will inevitably lead to disciplinary action. Let me be more
                specific: however justified Members may feel about making
                criticisms of me as an individual — and I have no doubt that
                such criticism is, on occasion, justified — it is my
                responsibility to be the current guardian of the dignity of the
                Chair. I must therefore advise that criticisms in the Chamber of
                the Chair should be made only on a substantive motion, as is the
                rule elsewhere. They should not be made incidentally in debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My second ruling concerns the reading of
                newspapers in the Chamber. This is clearly discourteous to other
                Members, especially those speaking at the time. Newspapers
                should not be brought into or read in the Chamber, except for
                brief quotations in the context of a speech. Furthermore, should
                this or any similar device be used with the possible intention
                of embarrassing a Member, it will be ruled out of order.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I must remind Members that it is not
                acceptable to accuse other Members of telling lies. This is a
                clear rule. Members may be said to be misinformed, misguided or
                mistaken, but they may not be accused of lying — that is
                unparliamentary language.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Chathaoirligh, Mr Initial Presiding
                Officer, I should like to make a point of order relating to your
                last remarks on unparliamentary language and your judgement on
                that. It is remarkable that part of the substance of the
                complaints that I made at the last sitting of the Assembly has
                been lumped in with your complaints. Perhaps I should have put
                forward a motion on your handling of that business. However, I
                would appreciate your views on the transcript of a remark
                attributed to Paul Berry. This is recorded on page&nbsp;236 of
                Hansard of 26 October.</p>

                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am taking Mr&nbsp;Maskey’s remarks as a
                point of order. They are clearly a query about my conduct of the
                proceedings. I cannot take a point of order on a point of order.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Maskey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Chathaoirligh, I want to make the specific
                point that in Hansard Mr Berry is reported as having referred to
                a full terrorist organisation in the Tyrone area. It is my
                understanding, and that of other Members, that those were not
                the words used. I would like you to investigate the accuracy of
                Hansard and report back to the Assembly. I am not certain that
                the report is accurate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I should also draw your attention to the
                substance of Mr Berry’s remarks as recorded in Hansard. They
                are quite disgraceful and bear out the criticism levelled at you
                at that time.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I made it clear at the time — as I think
                Hansard shows — that I was not content with some of the
                remarks and their tone. In that context, I have followed the
                matter up. All Members are learning procedure and what is
                appropriate behaviour in the Chamber. For example, one of the
                reasons the Initial Presiding Officer stands is to indicate to
                other Members that they should sit down — and we have just had
                such a situation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have tried in these first sittings to be
                reasonably flexible and understanding for I am aware that, while
                some Members have experience of various elected bodies, others
                have limited or no experience. To that end I have prepared one
                or two sheets of advice about procedure, which I hope will be of
                help to Members and will give them some confidence when
                participating in debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am content that the rulings I have given
                and the cautions I have issued to Members, even since the last
                sitting, have been appropriate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Maskey has asked me to look at the
                accuracy of Hansard. I will certainly do so.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Initial Presiding Officer, my point of
                order concerns earlier&nbsp;rulings — in particular, your
                references to newspapers and other papers. Was the action
                entirely appropriate? I am familiar with the practice at
                Westminster, where it is assumed that we have no papers and
                deliver speeches off the top of our heads in excellent English.
                That is the culture there.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To what extent is your ruling influenced by
                that culture? I recall that when we decided on the Assembly
                layout, and particularly this format with desks, the idea was to
                create a slightly different culture in this place. The desks are
                an acknowledgement that Members will have papers in front of
                them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps you would like to reflect on your
                ruling, bearing in mind that deliberate decision to try to
                create a slightly different culture here. While I have the
                greatest respect for the practices and procedures of the House
                of Commons, I wonder whether this is simply a case of following
                all its rulings as if there were no difference in terms of
                layout.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further to that point of order, Mr Presiding
                Officer. It is quite illogical and inaccurate to suggest that
                because there are desks, Members should be allowed to bring in
                newspapers to be used in the way that one was used at our
                previous sitting. The desks are purely for our convenience for
                the placing of papers. They are not an invitation to read
                newspapers or a place on which to rest our elbows while we wave
                newspapers to display some notice on them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the desks are intended to support a change
                of culture to that type of behaviour, it is not a culture that I
                wish to be involved in or associated with.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Both points of order addressed the same
                matter. First, I have been addressing the question of newspapers
                — not briefing papers or other such documents. I can
                understand that Members may wish to refer to documents, such as
                briefings, advice on speeches or notes and so on. I am referring
                specifically to newspapers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There may be times when Members will wish to
                refer to newspapers and quote from them in the context of a
                speech. However, it was drawn to my attention that at the last
                plenary sitting a Member had brought in a newspaper and had
                conducted himself in a way that was intended to embarrass.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I viewed the video recording, and I have no
                doubt that that is a possible interpretation of the behaviour at
                that time. I have therefore ruled in regard to newspapers. For
                anyone to openly read a newspaper, other than in making a
                quotation, is a discourtesy to the House and to other Members,
                particularly the one who is speaking. I intend to hold to that
                ruling. <i>[Interruption]</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am reminded of my ruling about mobile
                telephones, which seems to have been transiently breached, and I
                again advise Members that I wish to hold to that ruling. I am
                sure all Members will agree.</p>

                Presiding Officer. It is the only sensible one in the
                circumstances, although some Members may wish to hold up a
                newspaper whose headlines speak more eloquently than they ever
                could. <i>[Laughter]</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was one of those involved in determining
                the layout of the Chamber. I draw to your attention, lest in the
                number of points of order it go by default, that there was no
                intention — unless it was subconscious — to conduct business
                according to the type of wood in or the layout of the Chamber.
                There is no commitment to accept the present layout beyond the
                initial period, after which we will return to the matter,
                perhaps to decide a better arrangement.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members are aware that I am the one who
                was reading the newspaper at the last sitting. At no time did I
                wave the newspaper. I sat and read it. It contained an article
                about a matter concerning designation that had been raised by
                Mr&nbsp;Foster. I was surprised to discover from the article
                that, although in the House we are &quot;Unionist&quot;,
                &quot;Nationalist&quot; or &quot;Other&quot;, one party is all
                three. I thought that an important matter, and I wanted to read
                about it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I accept your ruling, Mr Initial
                Presiding Officer. I will not read newspapers in the House if

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That the Assembly approves the report
                prepared by the Ad Hoc Committee on the Procedural Consequences
                of Devolution and agrees to forward it to the Procedure
                Committee of the House of Commons.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ad Hoc Committee was established by the
                Assembly on 14&nbsp;September 1998 in response to a press notice
                from the Procedure Committee at Westminster. At its first
                meeting I was elected Chairman, and I am grateful to the members
                of the Committee for their unanimous support and for the
                co-operation and commitment they have demonstrated throughout
                the Committee’s work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee understood its remit to be the
                assessment of the changes that might be required to procedures
                at Westminster. It did not consider the procedural arrangements
                for the Assembly, and I have written to you separately about
                these matters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Procedural consequences constitute an unusual
                and difficult subject, and an unfamiliar area for most members
                of the Committee. Initially we had difficulty in establishing
                the context. There was uncertainty about the Northern Ireland
                Bill, an absence of comparable Scottish and Welsh bodies, and a
                lack of agreed procedures in the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee chose to flesh out its
                collective knowledge through presentations. Members heard from
                an academic lawyer and a retired senior civil servant. We took
                advice from the Cabinet Office and from others on some of the
                more detailed aspects of our brief including the relationship
                with Europe. Copies of the written evidence that was submitted
                to the Committee have been placed in the Library, together with
                the minutes of proceedings. The Committee is grateful for the
                considerable assistance and general willingness of many people
                to help with its work. Most of the advice was offered on an
                informal and non-attributable basis, and I offer only a general
                note of gratitude to those who helped.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee offered recommendations in two
                identified areas. First, we referred to Westminster procedures
                which the Committee felt should be modified; secondly, we
                referred to Westminster procedures which might be modified in
                the light of developments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The key principles recognise the primacy of
                Westminster and the reality, in effect, of devolution — that
                for most people in Northern Ireland the Assembly would, de
                facto, be the Government. The Committee disagreed on only one
                area — that of the primacy of Westminster — and that
                required a vote at its last meeting. This is a factual matter
                with which some parties had difficulty. Apart from that, we
                agreed on most matters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Consequently, the Committee recommends that
                Westminster should introduce changes to its handling of
                Questions on devolved matters, changes in how public expenditure
                on devolved matters is scrutinised and changes to the roles of
                Westminster Committees which focus on Northern Ireland. In
                practical terms this may mean an end to the Northern Ireland
                Grand Committee, considerable contraction to the remit of the
                Northern Ireland Select Committee — with a counter-balancing
                increase in the responsibilities of Assembly Committees — and
                perhaps a new system for consulting the Assembly on European
                legislative proposals. The overriding factor is that we are
                giving our views on this. These remain, and will remain,
                questions for Members at Westminster to decide.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report also confirms the relationship
                between Westminster and the Assembly, the authority of
                Westminster to scrutinise devolved arrangements through
                parliamentary questions and the continuing importance of
                Northern Ireland MPs in considering reserved and excepted
                matters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One further, and topical, area of interest is
                that of the relationship with Europe. At present, proposals for
                EU legislation are channelled through Member states for
                consideration by domestic legislatures. There are about 1,200
                proposals every year. These are whittled down, on grounds of
                relevance or effect, to about 50 for further action. The issue
                arises over how to provide for an input from the devolved
                Assemblies. The Committee believes there are sound financial
                reasons for not duplicating the initial sift of the 1,200
                proposals. It would prefer consideration to be given to the 50
                or so proposals that go to the EU Standing Committees at
                Westminster.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Westminster Committee that deals with
                European legislation has indicated that it would be content to
                provide the Assembly with all its information on these
                proposals. This would give Members an opportunity to focus on
                the consideration of the most significant issues. Of course, it
                is for the Assembly to decide how else it wishes to be heard in
                Brussels, and I expect that this will be the subject of further
                consideration following our visit last week.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other issues for further consideration
                include the impact of the Northern Ireland Bill when it becomes
                law, the relationship between this Assembly and the devolved
                bodies in Scotland and Wales once they are set up, and the wider
                issue of how this body will conduct its business. Indeed, the
                Assembly may wish to form its own Procedure Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Initial Presiding Officer, I would be
                grateful if you were to consider the issues that I have raised
                with you.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In closing, I wish to pay tribute to the
                Clerk of the Committee, who has provided outstanding support and
                service — often late into the night. We were on a tight
                timescale, and this required a great deal of extra work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, I wish to thank my fellow
                Committee members and commend their efforts. I want to pay
                tribute to the pragmatic, yet principled, approach taken by all
                of them as they identified the key issues and worked together to
                agree recommendations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am reminded of a House of Commons Committee
                Clerk who said famously that a committee was a cul-de-sac up
                which good ideas were led, there to be quietly strangled.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Throughout the seven meetings during which we
                produced a 4,000-word report with more than a dozen practical
                recommendations, there was rarely any disagreement. I have
                pointed out the one key area where there was disagreement as a
                result, I believe, of misunderstandings and simple drafting
                preferences. The real success that might emerge in this debate
                is that the Committee members sat down together and produced a
                report which was unanimously agreed, and I commend the report to
                the Assembly.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Foster:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the report and commend Mr McFarland
                and the Committee for their excellent work. The procedural
                consequences of devolution for the people of Northern Ireland
                are not just administrative, and we must consider the actuality,
                the real intent. We have come a long way. The democratic deficit
                in Northern&nbsp;Ireland, which has lasted so long, is on the
                point of being left behind. Democracy almost prevails once
                again. That is important to us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with paragraph 44 of the report:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;In many respects the full impact of
                these changes can only be addressed when the system has become
                fully operational.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is the effective reality of devolution,
                and Ulster Unionists have always sought such intent. We have
                endeavoured to be constructive for the overall well-being of the
                people of the Province. We have been positive while others —
                and they are present today — have sought the downfall of the
                Northern Ireland state through various methods of
                non-co-operation. Some have used so-called constitutional
                methods, while others have used the bomb and the bullet. We
                sincerely trust that such abhorrent and incredibly devious
                methods are now in the past. We look to the future. The
                potential is tremendous, and goodwill is evident throughout the
                world.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most of us have just come back from Brussels
                where we heard the European Union’s words of good intent
                echoed over and over again. Those who fail to live up to such
                goodwill will face the world’s scorn. A real decision-making
                parliament within the United Kingdom is round the corner. It
                will provide the strength and resolve to make decisions for
                Northern Ireland, and those decisions will be made by the
                Northern Ireland people. We have yearned for that for the past
                three decades. There is room for all of us by such democratic
                means. Indeed, there can be no other way. Surely no one wants a
                return to destruction. Will the people ever forgive us if we
                fail in our task?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree that we are subordinate to the
                sovereign Government at Westminster. As an Ulster Unionist, I am
                pleased that the constitutional position of Northern Ireland has
                been copper-fastened by the British/Irish Good Friday Agreement.
                However, the spirit of that Agreement is being derailed by some
                with only ulterior motives. To achieve good government, we are
                all required to work for the common good of the people of
                Northern Ireland. They, and no others, elected us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The base must be Stormont — and the first
                principle of good government is a home base. Secondly, honesty,
                integrity and responsibility must prevail, and good citizenship
                is of the essence. The Agreement encapsulates such requirements.
                If there were honesty and integrity, there would be immediate
                action on the issue of decommissioning. Cross-community trust
                and mutual respect would then prevail, and together we could
                look at economic and social issues and try to deal with them in
                a united way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are many issues to be faced. Employment
                problems, the acute agriculture crisis, education and health and
                personal social services require our attention.</p>

                procedural consequences of devolution for the House of Commons,
                and I ask the Member to try to draw his remarks in that
                direction. I have been fairly lenient and fairly broad in my

                but everyone must be committed. The serious moral issue of
                decommissioning cannot be ignored within this parliament of ours
                which we seek. The Assembly will be a parliament for Northern
                Ireland. We are working under the Westminster Parliament and Her
                Majesty’s Government, and I am pleased about that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An important situation confronts Northern
                Ireland. Decommissioning is a big issue which I must argue
                before we get round to dealing with procedures. We need
                decommissioning now — not next week or next year. One cannot
                take out a mortgage if one does not face responsibility.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The compilation of this report proved to be a
                very useful political exercise for the Assembly. Instead of its
                being a cul-de-sac, it opened up a highway of opportunity for
                all the Committee’s members. It brought us to a number of
                important and crucial issues, and it allowed us to examine them
                in relative calm and without serious contention or dispute.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was an interesting political experiment
                for this Assembly in that we were trying to achieve political
                consensus in the context of an Assembly Committee. It is a
                subject that was likely to excite political opinion on all
                sides, and so it did. Nonetheless, we should congratulate the
                Committee on having reached consensus on all its major
                recommendations, and there was little dispute about the
                substance of the report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was an achievement, and it sets an example
                for the Assembly as to how we should approach political issues
                in the future. The word &quot;consensus&quot; does not mean
                hanging up or throwing out one’s political principles; it
                means reaching as much of a political agreement as one can
                within the context of the subject under discussion.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me give credit to Mr McFarland for his
                independent and skilful chairmanship of the Committee. It was
                his approach that led to our achieving consensus, and the House
                owes him a considerable debt.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report is well presented in terms of both
                its text and its arguments. It reflects the substantial shift in
                the political centre of gravity from London to Belfast and
                recognises the change in political culture which has been
                reflected in the setting up of this Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Transferred matters will be of primary
                concern to this House, not Westminster, and substantial changes
                will flow from that by way of how Westminster deals with
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland. This has been reflected in the report
                where we have recommended that the Procedure Committee of the
                House of Commons modifies the Standing Orders of the Northern
                Ireland Select and Grand Committees. That will reflect the fact
                that a substantial amount of decision-making will flow to this
                House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the House of Commons considers the
                future of Select Committees it may decide to change or restrict
                them. One cannot second-guess, but that may apply in particular
                to the Select Committee on Northern&nbsp;Ireland Affairs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This report is useful because it enables us
                to examine issues that we did not expect to examine. I mention
                in particular the issue of European legislation because this
                body must consider seriously its input to the shaping, framing
                and amendment of EU legislation. This is an important matter for
                the Assembly, and we must examine procedures for influencing the
                input of the Administration at Westminster to European
                legislation. Such legislation is, of course, the province of the
                Commission and the European Parliament, but the preliminaries
                for devising and framing it are matters for Westminster and, let
                us hope, in part, the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important to return to the issue of
                European legislation, and I suggest that the Assembly set up its
                own European Committee to consider not only European legislation
                but the wide gamut of European issues, of which this House is
                more conscious as a result of the visit to Brussels last week.
                It is important for us to support this useful report. Members
                should read it in detail and draw conclusions from it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There will be future work for the Committee.
                The Northern Ireland Bill has not completed its passage through
                the House of Commons, and there remains the setting up of the
                Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly. Serious questions
                for us to re-examine will arise from these matters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend the report to the House. It was a
                useful political exercise, successfully completed, and it
                provides a model for the future. If we work in future as well as
                we did on the report we will make considerable progress in
                creating real and sustained consensus, and that must be for the
                good of our constituents.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev William McCrea:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I join the Committee Chairman in welcoming
                the report, which was commissioned under the Assembly’s terms
                of reference that are mentioned in paragraph 2:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;to consider the procedural consequences
                of devolution as they are likely to affect the relationship
                between, and working of, the Northern&nbsp;Ireland Assembly and
                the United Kingdom Parliament.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At times the Chairman of the Committee had
                difficulty in focusing some members’ attention on the
                Committee’s remit and duty; on how its deliberations would
                affect the Procedure Committee at Westminster; and on the
                changes which may be necessary in procedures at Westminster in
                the light of devolution.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Discussion and debates in Committee were
                wide-ranging. The successful presentation of the report is due
                to the diligent manner in which the subject was approached, the
                expert presentations and the work of the Committee Clerk.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The subject matter is of primary importance.
                The establishment of appropriate procedures at Westminster —
                the sovereign Parliament — must not be overlooked. Some
                Members have placed interpretations on the report. I say to the
                Chairman and to Mr&nbsp;Maginness that they are trying to put a
                slant on the report which is not there. In the Belfast Agreement
                there was tremendous emphasis on trying to dilute the power and
                authority of the sovereign Parliament at Westminster and at the
                same time a strengthening of the relationship with Dublin. That
                is one of the reasons I and my colleagues voted against the
                Agreement and make no apology for so doing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland’s finances come from and
                are voted on at Westminster. It is therefore vital that lines of
                communication be clear and that ties with the national
                Parliament remain strong. The report acknowledges the vital role
                of Westminster, but the interpretation that some are putting on
                it seems to play down the primacy of Parliament. The essential
                role of the Members of Parliament must be preserved rather than
                diminished. Some on the Committee shied away from parliamentary
                scrutiny and said that there might not be a role for the Select
                and Grand Committees at Westminster. However, that is not what
                paragraph 8 says. It states</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;In April 1998 the agreement of parties
                in Northern Ireland led, following elections, to the
                establishment of a shadow Assembly to which power would be
                devolved early in 1999. Paragraph 33 of Strand One of the
                Agreement describes the continuing role for Westminster and in
                particular confirms a continuing role for the Grand and Select
                Committees.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Agreement confirmed the continued role of
                the Grand and Select Committees. The impression has been given
                that major changes should be made. However, while modifications
                may have to be made, we must remember that he who pays the piper
                has the right to call the tune. Are we suggesting that while
                Westminster gives the money for the running of Northern Ireland,
                Members of Parliament will have no power of scrutiny of how that
                money is being spent? That money is important for Northern
                Ireland, and Members of Parliament should have the right to
                ensure that it is used in the best interests of the citizens of
                this part of the United Kingdom.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During our discussions, the key principles
                were outlined in paragraph 9. It states</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Northern Ireland Act 1998 will set
                out the legislative competence of the Assembly. The provisions
                of the Northern Ireland Bill explicitly emphasise that the
                United Kingdom Parliament retains the power to legislate on any
                subject throughout the United Kingdom.&quot;</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Essentially the fundamental basis for
                the relationship between the Assembly and Westminster lies in
                the clear understanding that matters which are transferred to
                the Assembly are its responsibility and its responsibility
                alone.&quot;</p>

                essentially the sole preserve of the Northern Ireland Assembly.
                Paragraph 13 previously stated</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Committee believes that, as was
                previously the case under devolution, questions on transferred
                matters should be taken only in the Assembly. Questions to
                Ministers in the House of Commons should be ruled out of order
                and referred to Belfast. Questions on transferred matters are
                matters for the Northern Ireland Assembly and should not be
                taken at Westminster.&quot;</p>

                desire to go there will certainly want to ensure that their
                constituents get the best possible government. If there are
                matters that they think the Assembly is not handling correctly
                they have a right to raise them at Westminster. There ought to

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report acknowledges that there are
                important issues that need further detailed scrutiny. We flagged
                some of them as we came across them, though not all were
                strictly within our present remit. This is not a final report.
                It will be necessary to revisit many of the issues in the light
                of experience. However, I genuinely feel that the report will
                make a valuable contribution to the development of procedures at
                Westminster, permitting Members of the national Parliament to
                retain a vital and important role in the democratic process, and
                allowing us to exercise the power which has been devolved to us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish once again to compliment all those who
                helped in the preparation of this report, especially the
                Committee Clerk, and to note the vital role that the Chairman of
                the Committee, Mr&nbsp;Alan&nbsp;McFarland, played in our
                deliberations. I commend the report to the Assembly.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Nelis:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat a Chathaoirligh, I would
                like to join the other Committee members in commending the
                Chairperson, Mr&nbsp;Alan&nbsp;McFarland, for presiding over,
                with great difficulty at times, the preparation of a report
                which, as Sinn&nbsp;Fein stated when the interim report was
                presented, was, in essence, premature. However, in terms of
                learning, this was a valuable process, and the Committee’s
                members addressed themselves to the remit. It was an interesting
                political exercise.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was substantial agreement on many of
                the questions posed by the remit, including the transferred
                matters and co-operation with other assemblies. There are also
                glaring omissions, such as the procedural consequences of
                devolution in the context of the North/South bodies. Most
                members worked their way through the many constitutional
                questions raised by the remit, but others sought to put their
                own political spin on it. This was not in the spirit either of
                learning or of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The final draft of the report was given to
                the Committee on Friday 30 October, shortly before the meeting
                began. Sinn Fein noted a number of changes, or additions, to the
                draft that had been presented to us at the bilateral meeting and
                on which we had agreed in principle. What appears to have
                happened, a Chathaoirligh, in respect of paragraph 9 is that the
                text has been added to in a manner which, I believe, goes beyond
                what the Committee was asked to do.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some aspects of the draft document still
                present that difficulty. Instead of commenting, as we were asked
                to do, the report tells Parliament what it should do. Unionist
                representatives on the Committee — and this is where the
                disagreement comes in — engaged in a semantic exercise
                designed to appear to tighten the relationship between the
                Assembly and Westminster. This is not within the spirit of the
                Good Friday Agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Devolution apart, the Six Counties Assembly
                is equated with the projected devolution in Scotland and Wales,
                although these bodies have not been set up. The North of Ireland
                Assembly and the Scottish and Welsh Assemblies are set up under
                different Acts and with widely differing powers. The processes
                cannot be equated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The remit of the Ad Hoc Committee was simply
                to consider or comment on the changes necessary and the
                constitutional implications for Westminster as a consequence of
                the legislation resulting from the Good Friday Agreement. The
                additions to paragraph 9, beginning at the third line from the
                bottom, obviously relate to the Unionist strategy of seeking to
                entrench the Union, in spite of the all-island dynamics of the
                Good Friday Agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This exercise, played out in the bilaterals,
                is essentially about plugging holes in the initial draft, which
                left the relationship with Westminster too much of a hostage to
                fortune. Neither draft — not even the final one — takes
                cognisance of the fact that the concept of sovereignty over the
                Six Counties has changed inalterably. However, the draft
                document presented to the Committee on 30 October, and currently
                before the Assembly, represents a clear shift away, in spirit
                and in substance, from the essential implications of the Good
                Friday Agreement for Westminster’s relationship with the
                Assembly. It is these implications, and their constitutional
                significance, which profoundly distinguish this Assembly from
                what is planned for Scotland, Wales and, indeed, England —
                something with which the Unionists in the Committee refused to
                deal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is for that reason that we had their
                attempts in the bilaterals to rewrite the draft in the same way
                as they attempt to rewrite the Good Friday Agreement. The
                amendments are tied up with their anachronistic political
                assumption — the assumption of Thatcher — that Belfast is as
                British as Finchley. It is not. We have moved on, a
                Chathaoirligh, and the Devolution Committee at Westminster in
                its press release, which became the remit for this Ad Hoc
                Committee, recognised that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is why they sought our comments. That is
                why my party objected to the Unionists’ conclusions, which
                refused to recognise that sovereignty is redefined by the Good
                Friday Agreement and that this addition to the previously agreed
                draft was, and still is, unnecessary.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In spite of the Committee Chairman’s
                assertions that there was agreement on the report — there was,
                in many instances — it was not unanimous. It would therefore
                be in the best interests of the Committee and of the Assembly to
                refer back to the Committee a number of issues arising from the
                report so that unanimity could be reached before it is sent to
                Westminster.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I too pay tribute to the Chairperson and to
                the Clerk for his very hard work, late hours and the manner in
                which he provided us with all the necessary documents. Go raibh

                and helpful to Members, could be produced by the new deadline,
                which is today, 9 November. We have met our deadline and
                produced a full report, which will help Members to understand
                better the relationships between the Assembly and Westminster.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report, in its various recommendations,
                looks forward to full devolution of powers to the Assembly. It
                clearly demonstrates the necessity to equip those to whom power
                has been devolved with the necessary authority to exercise it. I
                therefore caution those who use phrases such as &quot;He who
                pays the piper&quot;. This is not a puppet parliament, nor a
                Fisher Price parliament. The Assembly will exercise real power
                on those issues that are transferred to it. And that is the
                significant part. We will have that right. In fact, we demand
                it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This afternoon, when the Minister outlines
                his priorities on public expenditure, for example, I hope to
                hear Members’ views on how taxpayers’ moneys should be spent
                here. We have the right to determine our priorities and produce
                the best package for the people. That is part and parcel of the
                relationship between here and Westminster. We want to exercise
                power without undue interference.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report deals with all the salient issues.
                We have also earmarked other areas that the Assembly needs to
                examine. For example, reference has been made to European
                legislation, an understanding of which is an essential part of
                political life for us. I believe that the Assembly must have a
                European Committee, but it will be up to the House to take that
                issue further. Proper procedures must be established now to
                enable us to reach fundamental decisions on how to move forward
                on those areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In commending the report to the House, I
                would be remiss not to pay special tribute to the Committee’s
                Chairman, Mr&nbsp;McFarland, and its Clerk. Together, they led
                the work of the Committee. They demonstrated, through diplomacy
                and dialogue, that it is possible to reach understandings and
                agreements, of which this report is a product.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I had not intended to speak in this debate
                but I have been so impressed with the plethora of nauseating,
                self-congratulatory compliments that have been flying about that
                I find it necessary to inject a note of realism into the
                proceedings. This Committee was not, as appears to be the case,
                playing happy families. Its members attended, as I did, having
                been charged with a particular duty — dealing with the remit.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much has been said about the great work that
                is being done and the great endeavours that are being made. A
                competent lawyer, had he been furnished with the relevant
                material, could have reached the same conclusions in half a day.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr S Wilson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What would he have charged?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The prophet of a magnificent report has asked
                a question. The answer is considerably less than the salaries of
                those who were actually involved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The impression is being given, particularly
                by Mr&nbsp;Maginness, the Member for North Belfast, that this
                was a sort of chapel of consensual ecumenism. It was nothing of
                the sort.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One may oppose, as I most strongly do, Sinn
                Fein’s views — their political objectives as well as their
                methodology — but when it came to the issues that are
                important to them, they made it clear what they wanted. They
                wanted the removal of all the references in this report to the
                sovereignty of the United&nbsp;Kingdom Parliament. They made no
                bones about that, and there was a very heated, but honest,
                debate about the issue of sovereignty. What was most notable was
                that the party representatives who voted against the inclusion
                of the term &quot;sovereignty&quot; in paragraph 9 of this
                report were not from Sinn Fein (its members abstained); they
                were Mr&nbsp;Maginness and his colleague Mr&nbsp;Dallat.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The truth is that beneath all this apparently
                consensual behaviour, other agendas and directions are being
                constantly pushed. They are being pushed in the direction of a
                united Ireland by the SDLP as assiduously as by Sinn&nbsp;Fein,
                but with a much lesser degree of open honesty.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to turn to two relevant issues — one
                being the question of our association with Europe. Those from
                the pro-Union side who were on this Committee and who were also
                involved in the trip to Brussels should realise that those on
                the other side of this Assembly favour Northern&nbsp;Ireland’s
                becoming some sort of autonomous region within Europe and being
                entitled to a direct input.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Indeed, the silliness of this argument, in
                its most extreme form, was advanced by Mr&nbsp;Farren, who
                failed to realise that the only people who can make a direct
                commitment are the member states, and there is no member state
                entitled &quot;Northern&nbsp;Ireland&quot;. A fatuous and
                irrelevant association with the regions in Europe, particularly
                the German Länder, was advanced at one of the meetings that we
                had with a member of the European Parliament, Herr&nbsp;Brock.
                He made it quite clear that there was a fundamental distinction
                between a unitary sovereign state with devolved mixed
                legislatures and a federal government such as the Federal
                Government of what is now a united Germany.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All the time, however, despite the appearance
                of consensus, people were pushing their own agendas and pushing
                hard for a united Ireland. Let no one be mistaken about that.
                Something else which will become increasingly apparent to
                Members of the Assembly who are not part of the central caucus
                is the enormous amount of mutual back-scratching and
                self-congratulation that is going on in the two major parties
                who appear to think that they can run the Assembly on their own
                and that all the other parties are irrelevant. That will not be
                the case, but that will not prevent them from trying to make it
                happen. Excitement at the prospect of office is causing one
                party to suffer convulsions, and, no doubt, the other is about
                to become epileptic.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members should have no doubts about the
                intended purpose of this report. Northern Ireland is part of the
                United Kingdom and will remain part of the United Kingdom, and
                we should endeavour to ensure that this situation is permanent.
                Those people, supposedly on the pro-Union side, who are
                pussyfooting around with arrangements designed, apparently, to
                keep them in a position of power should be conscious that this
                is not possible, because decommissioning and other related
                issues are, beyond any doubt, not part of the Agreement. They
                are not in the Agreement because some people were prepared to
                acquiesce in a dishonest process. This Committee, to a very
                large extent, reflected that problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report, however, does state relatively
                clearly what the Committee’s response to its remit was. That
                remit was not particularly complex; the Committee looked at
                those powers which were transferred to the Assembly, those
                powers which were excepted and reserved to Westminster and at
                the question of the future handling of business currently dealt
                with by bodies at Westminster.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report deals with these matters
                adequately; Mr&nbsp;McFarland was a tolerant and understanding
                Chairman, and the Committee Clerk was assiduous, efficient and
                courteous at all times, providing a great deal of assistance to
                the Committee. However, we should not persist in the nonsensical
                belief that members of Committees are involved in a prodigious
                volume of work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I attended meetings of this Committee as
                frequently as anyone; I participated in the Committee’s
                debates as much as any member — if not more — but I cannot
                pretend that I was burdened with an enormous amount of work, nor
                was I required to expend a vast amount of intellectual energy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend this somewhat less than magnificent
                report to the House.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ervine:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to pay tribute to the Chairman
                of the Committee. Even though the report’s findings did not
                receive unanimous support, he was certainly unanimously elected
                as Chairman — a first time for that. He conducted those
                proceedings which I attended very well, and he was ably assisted
                by the Committee Clerk who also deserves credit for his work in
                the short time that we had to put this report together.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, I detect a sense of resentment
                in relation to this report — resentment that, I fear, comes
                from Sinn&nbsp;Fein, who are almost suggesting that this report
                is not in the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement. But to do so
                is to miss the most important part. Northern&nbsp;Ireland shall
                remain part of the United&nbsp;Kingdom for as long as the
                greater number of people wish.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This fact is reflected adequately and of
                necessity in this report; it is about the creation of a tier of
                government and how it fits into that tier of government which
                undoubtedly has primacy, and that primacy is clearly identified,
                not only in the Belfast Agreement, but also in our work and the
                fact that we have a Secretary of State. Sinn&nbsp;Fein’s
                apparent self-denial of all these things is a form of resentment
                from which they would do well to move away.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the basis that I have been sold out, I am
                delighted to hear that Northern&nbsp;Ireland is going to remain
                part of the United Kingdom. Hansard will show that
                Mr&nbsp;McCartney said so. Of course, he would.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The establishment of the
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland Assembly provides the opportunity to
                exercise power locally through the Belfast Agreement, within the
                context of the sovereignty of a Parliament at Westminster. This
                Committee had a job to do in terms of how we are to fit in and
                how to create circumstances where this could be seen as the
                first salvo perhaps, the first in the establishment of a two-way
                street between Westminster and Belfast. Such conditions will not
                weaken the umbilical cord; they will strengthen it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This will not be the only umbilical cord; one
                will also be connected to Cardiff, to Edinburgh and to Dublin,
                and these will begin to deal with healing the relationships that
                have been fractured over many years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a recommendation — a recommendation
                that will land on the desks at Westminster, and it will be
                decided on by those who have sovereignty. All we can hope is
                that they pay attention to what we want to achieve. By
                recommending this report we are saying here is a Belfast that
                wants to prosper, here is a Belfast that wants to do well, a
                Belfast that recognises that it has to have stronger
                relationships, not weaker.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Assembly is devolved — not divorced
                — from Westminster, and some Members must pay serious
                attention to that fact. They will have to make all the facets of
                the Belfast Agreement work. Are we accusing Sinn&nbsp;Fein as
                they have accused us in the past, of being á la carte in
                relation to the Good Friday Agreement? It is time for
                Sinn&nbsp;Fein to wake up and play a serious role — this
                should have been a unanimous report. I hope that Sinn&nbsp;Fein
                will reflect and amend their attitude to what, I think, is a
                very good report — a report which is the first salvo in the
                strengthening of the umbilical cord between Belfast and
                Westminster.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many Members seem to have become confused
                about what the Committee set out to do. I would like to refer to
                the points made by Mr&nbsp;McCartney, Mr&nbsp;McCrea and Mrs
                Nelis about devolution.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Good Friday Agreement or not, devolution,
                whether in Northern&nbsp;Ireland or Scotland, equals a dilution
                of power. There is no getting away from that fact. Devolution
                means diluting power at the centre and transferring it to the
                regions. It means strengthening the power of this Assembly in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland and strengthening the power of the people
                of Northern&nbsp;Ireland. For some reason we have not yet
                grasped the full meaning of devolution. Mr&nbsp;McCartney
                referred to the German federalist system, but devolution within
                the United&nbsp;Kingdom is in a United&nbsp;Kingdom context. It
                could be seen as a first step towards federalism, towards
                confederalism or towards subsidiarity.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have to appreciate that devolution is a
                dilution of power.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Nelis said that sovereignty has been
                redefined by the Good Friday Agreement. I disagree. Sovereignty
                has been redefined by the Labour Government’s handing over
                power to Scotland, Wales and Northern&nbsp;Ireland, with or
                without the Good Friday Agreement. We must open the doors of
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland and let the moths out. What we are talking
                about is devolution of power within the United Kingdom, not
                divorce — dilution to strengthen our hand and the hand of our
                people. That is the important point.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Would the Member accept that dissolving of
                power is not the point in question? It is the transferring of
                powers to a different region that we are talking about. We are
                not dissolving power, we are transferring that power to be

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No. The power of Westminster without any
                doubt is being lessened, and the powers of Belfast, Cardiff and
                Edinburgh are being strengthened. Let me move to the point.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to respond to certain points that have
                been made in the Chamber. I apologise for not initially
                commending the report, the work of the Chairman, Mr McFarland,
                and the Clerk, Mr&nbsp;Reynolds, and my colleagues on the
                Committee for contributing constructively to the debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;McCartney did not want to state that
                he was working hard, but we had to work hard to respond to many
                of his contributions. He suggested that Northern Ireland is part
                of the United Kingdom and will remain so. However, we must also
                remember — and this is a point that has been raised before but
                not by certain other Members — that Northern&nbsp;Ireland,
                Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland are parts of the
                European Union. In talking about the United Kingdom’s
                devolving power, we have to appreciate that not only is power
                being devolved from Westminster to Belfast, it has already been
                devolved upwards from Westminster to Brussels. There are three
                stages of the devolution process.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr A Maginness:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Would the Member agree that the concept of
                sovereignty that has been much bandied about this morning as it
                was in the Committee, is an outmoded concept? Sovereignty as
                such, in the latter part of the twentieth century, does not
                exist. If you are a member of NATO and the European Union, if
                you are a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights
                or any other international conventions, you have in effect,
                pooled sovereignty with other bodies, other countries and other
                communities. Therefore, the concept of sovereignty is outmoded
                and old-fashioned and should be jettisoned.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful to the Member — it might be
                excessive to jettison the concept of sovereignty, but I totally
                agree that the idea and the nature of sovereignty is changing as
                we move forward in a new world where there is new thinking and
                more democracy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To jettison it might be to let go too
                quickly. We need to understand the new forms it will take and
                the new allegiances, and powers and procedures that will flow
                therefrom. I am delighted that this debate is actually covering
                issues that go far beyond the borders of Northern Ireland,
                setting Northern Ireland in context within these islands, within
                Europe and within the world. It is valuable that the debate is,
                rightly, going in that direction.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My last point concerns what I would call the
                &quot;nearly all-party&quot; agreement in the Committee. I am
                disappointed that a full consensus was not reached. It was a
                very valuable working experience for us as Committee members,
                and while we did not reach a consensus, we all listened to each
                other and took on board what others were saying. Nobody walked
                out, and nobody stomped out, and there was no anger. We arrived
                at a report which will guide us forward in the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I underline issues such as European
                legislation, which the House should examine in the future. Mr
                Foster made a valuable point about the important role Europe has
                played. We should look at how we relate to Brussels. This will
                be very important. Mr McCartney suggested that it was silly to
                consider this, that we could not go directly to Europe. We have
                a direct flight to Europe, which 90% of the representatives here
                used last week. We can go directly to Europe, formally or
                informally.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend the report and the &quot;nearly
                all-party&quot; agreement, and I thank my colleagues for their
                work.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hussey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I rise at the risk of becoming another
                political pygmy in the &quot;cycloptic&quot; shadow of
                Mr&nbsp;McCartney — but then a Cyclops has only one eye.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I pay tribute to Mr McFarland and thank him
                for the capable way in which he led us through our work. I also
                thank Joe Reynolds, the Committee Clerk, who was brilliant at
                getting materials to us in time, in spite of the problems we
                have in the west with the post. But perhaps that will be dealt
                with at another time. I also pay tribute to those with expert
                opinions who attended our deliberations and informed us. I
                congratulate all members for the way in which they approached
                the task that was given to us. Our remit was relevant to both
                the Northern Ireland Assembly and the United Kingdom Parliament.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will return later to section 9.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to recommendation 17, I hope that
                Questions on Northern Ireland will continue to be taken every
                four weeks. The period for Questions has been reduced from 40 to
                30 minutes to take account of devolution. This body does not
                wish to see that period reduced any further, because it remains
                important that our Members of Parliament at Westminster have
                adequate time to scrutinise the actions of the Secretary of
                State, particularly on reserved and excepted matters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paragraphs 20 to 24 of the report should be
                considered in conjunction with paragraphs 37 to 41. Here it is
                emphasised that there is still work to be done. The report
                suggests an evolving situation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the European issue the report describes
                how we have an input into the internal workings of Westminster
                on Europe via the Select Committee on EU legislation and the two
                European Standing Committees. This was not mentioned in the
                report, but it has certainly been mentioned in debate. I
                believe, Mr&nbsp;Initial Presiding Officer, that you have been
                made aware of this Committee’s concern. It would be right for
                us to retain a high-profile regional influence. I accept that
                direct input is by way of our sovereign Parliament, but it is
                certainly vital — I am sure that all who were in Brussels last
                week would agree — that we must retain a high regional
                influence. That is something which the Assembly must take on
                board.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to conclude by referring to section 9.
                The concept of sovereignty, when taken within a European
                context, is quite interesting. The French, for example, have
                their viewpoint on sovereignty, even though the European Union
                would have certain considerations for the whole of Europe.
                Perhaps we in the United&nbsp;Kingdom could learn from the
                French and be prepared to take a stand on behalf of our people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn&nbsp;Fein’s admission that it viewed
                the addition of the extra sentence as a tightening of the
                relationship between the Northern Ireland Assembly and
                Westminster — with the retrenchment of the Union — is quite
                interesting. The additional sentence is, I am sure, in the
                opinion of those on this side of the House, and perhaps others,
                merely a summing-up of the facts which were expressed in the
                preceding part of section 9.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Committee I asked if the previous part of
                section 9 was acceptable to everyone. The reply was that it was
                acceptable. I would ask Members to read the second last
                sentence.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does Mr&nbsp;Hussey accept that in paragraph
                41, we not only have the statement of sovereignty, but also the
                implication of sovereignty? More power is going to go to
                Westminster, and there will be a greater role for Westminster
                because it is proposed that a Committee on Regional Affairs be
                established to scrutinise even further the powers that are now
                to be devolved to Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hussey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can only agree with Mr Paisley.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Fein’s main concern was with the
                absence of a reference to the fact that the establishment of the
                Northern Ireland Assembly provides the opportunity to exercise
                power locally. Sinn Fein was determined that reference should be
                made there to the Belfast Agreement. After deliberation and
                adjournment it was agreed that a reference to the Belfast
                Agreement could be included, and then the goalposts were moved.
                I do not know why — I have my suspicions. Also, Sinn&nbsp;Fein
                did not vote against this addition. Why not? I would point out
                that on a word count 99.5% of this report is acceptable. That is
                a much higher rate of agreement than we have had on other
                things.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend the report to the Assembly.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr S Wilson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to thank the Chairman and Clerk
                of the Committee for the way in which they conducted the
                business of the committee and for steering us towards what I
                believe — despite what Mr&nbsp;McCartney, who is now absent,
                may have said — is a magnificent report. Magnificence can be
                measured in a number of ways but according to the dictionary it
                can be judged by the greatness of the achievement of a
                particular issue or document.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Using that criterion this is a magnificent
                report. To deal with complex issues in only 13 pages is quite an
                achievement. <i>[Laughter]</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.00</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is magnificent in that it addresses all
                the questions that the Committee was asked to deal with. That
                would be quite an achievement for any politician. As my
                colleague Rev&nbsp;William&nbsp;McCrea has said, the report
                emphasises the primacy and the sovereignty of the
                United&nbsp;Kingdom Parliament. Item 8 of the minutes of the
                proceedings of the Committee of 30&nbsp;October states</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Chairman then proposed that the

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although some Members absolutely oppose the
                word &quot;Westminster&quot; crossing their lips, the document
                says</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;It was agreed unanimously.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I repeat that the report is magnificent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The DUP approach was to set out clear
                objectives and, unlike Mr&nbsp;Foster, we did not lose our
                focus. One objective was to make sure that any change in
                procedures at Westminster as a result of devolution in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland, did not diminish Northern&nbsp;Ireland’s
                position within the United&nbsp;Kingdom. The report is permeated
                with the fact that Westminster retains sovereignty over
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland, and that has been agreed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Fein realised rather late, when it had
                considered all aspects of the report, that the sovereignty of
                Westminster remains. I suspect that if target words that always
                trigger responses in the minds of Sinn Fein had been omitted, it
                might not have noticed that at all. When it saw the words in
                paragraph 9 —</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;remain the preserve of the Parliament
                at Westminster, include such matters as sovereignty&quot; —</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">dissension started to appear. However, as
                Mr&nbsp;Hussey has already said, the whole thrust of the
                paragraph before comment was that the Westminster Parliament is
                sovereign. It states</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The provisions of the
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland Bill explicitly emphasise that the United
                Kingdom Parliament retains the power to legislate on any subject
                throughout the United&nbsp;Kingdom.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It concludes</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Consequently, the establishment of the
                Northern Ireland Assembly provides the opportunity to exercise
                power locally through the Belfast Agreement within the context
                of the sovereignty of Parliament at Westminster&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The only part that Sinn Fein disagreed with
                was that little phrase, but when voting on the whole report it
                voted on it all. That is a magnificent achievement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McElduff had a bad weekend. He took on a
                Dutchman in Brussels. Irish Republicans should have learned
                that, whether it be 1690 or 1998, they should not take on the
                Dutch. He did not follow the party line but engaged in
                antisocial behaviour in Brussels, and I am amazed that he has
                not ended up in a wheelchair the same way as Martin&nbsp;McGuinness.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us look at the relationship between
                Westminster and the Assembly. There is the ability to question
                the role of Committees and our roles in finance and legislation.
                The report recognises that the Assembly will have the authority
                to deal with those matters, as one would expect with devolution,
                but overall power will still reside at Westminster.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was no dissension about paragraph 17,
                which says</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;A period for questions on Northern
                Ireland ought to be retained at Westminster&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Westminster will still have its finger on the
                pulse.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">According to paragraph 13, while transferred
                matters will be dealt with primarily by the Assembly, there will
                still be provision for Questions to be asked in the House of
                Commons. Of course, as one would expect, the Questions will then
                be referred to the relevant Minister in Northern Ireland, and
                the answer made available to MPs at Westminster. Westminster’s
                role in scrutinising and questioning what happens in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland has not been diminished.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paragraph 24 recommends that Committees
                should retain the ability to examine expenditure, administration
                and policy matters. However, an Assembly Committee dealing with
                a specific issue should not be duplicated in the House of
                Commons. That is a sensible recommendation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have said</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;There should be a review of the Select
                Committee system to prevent duplication of the work of the
                devolved legislature.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But those Committees will still have the same
                role as they have had previously. With regard to finance. For
                example, paragraph 29 says</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Westminster should retain
                responsibility for oversight of the appropriation of funds into
                the Northern&nbsp;Ireland Office budget&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, one would expect that. The
                scrutinising of individual matters could probably be dealt with
                in greater detail by an Assembly public accounts committee, but
                financial scrutiny will remain at Westminster.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In terms of legislation, paragraph 31 says</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the United Kingdom Parliament retains
                the power to legislate on any subject throughout the
                United&nbsp;Kingdom.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paragraph 32 says</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Whilst it will remain possible for any
                Member at Westminster to propose a Private Member’s Bill on

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It will still be possible to do this,
                although it does say that past experience suggests that it is
                not likely that many such proposals will become law.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have indeed produced a magnificent report
                and, as Mr&nbsp;McCartney has said, with the minimum of effort.
                I contend that it was produced at significantly less cost than
                his lawyer friends would have charged had they been asked to

                amháin, ní gá a rá. Caithfidh mise a rá nach bhfuilimid ar
                aon intinn amháin, go háirithe sa dóigh ina bhfuil na

                neamhaird a dhéanamh de Chomhaontú Aoine an Chéasta. Ach, sin
                mar atá.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to support Mr Alban Maginness’s
                assertion that this is not an agreed report in that the
                substance of the report has not been agreed — there was an
                absence of consensus. I commend the Chairman and the Committee
                Clerk for the way they presided over the meetings, and I want to
                reiterate the point that it was difficult for many Members to
                focus on the precise remit.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will keep my comments brief. I want to
                underline issues raised by Mrs&nbsp;Mary&nbsp;Nelis, our group
                spokesperson. We constantly and consistently objected to
                attempts by Unionist participants in the Ad Hoc Committee for
                comfort blankets to be extended to them — trying to have the
                umbilical cord of Westminster written in, line after line.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No Nationalist member of the Committee sought
                any such comfort blanket. When a vote was taken — and this is
                crucial — no Nationalist supported the report or its contents.
                I ask for a ruling from you, a Chathaoirligh, as to whether a
                vote on this report should be taken in the Assembly today.
                Sinn&nbsp;Fein’s preference is that this report should be
                referred back to the Committee for further examination in the
                hope of arriving at consensus eventually. Clearly we have not
                got this as yet. Sin an méid atá le rá agamsa ar an ábhar

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me say something about a request that has
                now come forward for a second time — initially from Assembly
                Member Mrs&nbsp;Mary&nbsp;Nelis and now from Assembly Member
                Mr&nbsp;Barry&nbsp;McElduff. The only procedural way to take
                matters back would be for the Chairman of the Committee, Mr
                McFarland, to withdraw the motion or for the Question not to be
                put.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not possible to ask for individual
                matters in the report to be taken back. I make this point
                because in other forums where Members operate — in local
                government, for example — this is often a practice, but there
                is no procedural means of doing that here at present.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In terms of any other motions in respect of
                particular matters being brought forward, it is now too late to
                put down any amendments. Therefore the only way in which the
                matter could be discussed by the Assembly is by leave of the
                House, which means by unanimous agreement of those who are
                present. These are the only ways in which the matter could be
                dealt with.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As to the question of there being a vote, of
                course there will be a vote. This is a motion, and there will be
                a vote. When the Question is put, it will become apparent
                whether a formal division is necessary, but this is a motion to
                accept the report, and therefore there will be an opportunity
                for the House to give its view.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The representative from the Women’s
                Coalition, Ms Morrice, said that we should all understand what
                devolution was and then went on to display ignorance of what it
                was. She seems to have a misconception about power and
                authority, about dissolving — although I am not quite sure
                what she meant by that — or delegating authority. She took
                umbrage at my suggesting that devolution was about delegating
                authority, but that is precisely what devolution is about.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The day after devolution happens, if it does,
                power will still reside, technically and legally, at Westminster
                — delegated authority may come here, but the power will still
                reside at Westminster.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, it is important to deal with the split
                personalities in Sinn Fein. Sinn Fein Members were among those
                who applauded this report in the Committee. They agreed it,
                along with every other member of the Committee. The record is
                clear:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Chairman then proposed that the
                Committee accept the revised Report as the final Report of the
                Committee; it was agreed unanimously.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There appears to be some ineptitude on the
                part of those representing Sinn Fein on the Committee. They
                agreed to something that their betters outside the Committee do
                not agree to, and they are raising smoke to hide their
                embarrassment. They agreed the report, and it will be
                interesting to see if they have the support of other
                Sinn&nbsp;Fein Members when it comes to the vote, or whether
                they prove that some of them are &quot;not fit to be allowed out
                on their own&quot; — a phrase which, I think, was used on the
                BBC.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are three issues that arise from the
                report. I come more from Mr&nbsp;McCartney’s position — I do
                not think there is anything magnificent about the report. To say
                it is magnificent because it is 13 pages long, stretches the
                notion of magnificence.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr S Wilson:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On that basis it could have been even more
                magnificent. However, there are considerable improvements in
                this final report from an earlier edition. Colleagues in my own
                party, and in other parties, are to be congratulated on the
                clawback achieved in the later Committee stages.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to deal, in particular, with three
                issues — questions in the House of Commons, Committees dealing
                with Northern Ireland in the House of Commons, and financial
                accountability in the House of Commons. As far as Questions in
                the House are concerned, the report makes it very clear — and
                I want to put this interpretation on the record — that
                questions on transferred matters are primarily for the Northern
                Ireland Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The use of the word &quot;primarily&quot;
                indicates very clearly that it is not a matter exclusively for
                the Assembly and, therefore, Questions on transferred matters
                can, and should, properly be asked at Westminster. It may be
                that the Secretary of State will be restricted in what she, or a
                future he, may say on the issue, referring it to the appropriate
                Minister in Northern Ireland and tabling, for the record, the
                response given.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is not any different from what happens
                when questions are asked on the activities of the various
                agencies. The response is tabled in the Library and, on some
                occasions, included in Hansard. The issue of questions is,
                therefore, dealt with adequately in the report and indicates an
                ongoing role for the House of Commons.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sure that the Ulster Unionists will be
                delighted with this ongoing role. All the SDLP Members of
                Parliament are in this Chamber and, therefore, entitled to ask
                questions; all the Democratic Unionist Members of Parliament are
                in this Chamber and entitled to ask Questions; the United
                Kingdom Unionist Member of Parliament is in this Chamber and
                entitled to ask questions; and the two loyal Members of Her
                Majesty’s Opposition from Sinn Fein, although they have not
                taken the oath as yet, are also in the Chamber.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, two Members of the Ulster Unionist
                Party are in the Chamber as well. They are entitled to ask
                questions, and I am sure that they will be rooting for the six
                Ulster Unionist Members of Parliament who are not in this
                Chamber. They would want to give them a full role in
                scrutinising what is happening in Northern Ireland and also give
                them the opportunity to ask questions of the Ministers who will
                be responsible for the various Departments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report quite properly suggests that the
                role of the Northern&nbsp;Ireland Grand Committee will be
                considerably reduced, and that some consideration will have to
                be given to its future life. Unlike the Select Committees, the
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland Grand Committee does not have any real
                scrutiny role, and it may become redundant.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Select Committee is very different. I am
                glad to see that the report makes it clear that the only
                restriction that would be considered in relation to the Select
                Committee’s role is on duplication. I assume that means that
                if the Assembly were considering roads issues in some committee,
                a Commons Select Committee would not consider those same issues
                at the same time. Such duplication would be quite unnecessary.
                If bodies are looking into various aspects of
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland life, the Select Committee will stay away
                from those issues — at least until reports have been issued.
                Therefore I do not think that there will be such duplication.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a need for a good relationship to be
                built up between the Assembly and the Select Committee so that
                each will know what the other is scrutinising and examining.
                Here again, the Committee has made a good fist of its
                recommendation in relation to the Commons Committees. I have
                some difficulty in relation to the financial scrutiny
                arrangements. I remind Ms&nbsp;Morrice that there is a
                difference between delegating authority and exercising the
                authority that has been delegated, and the right of Parliament
                to scrutinise what has gone on. Delegated authority can be fully
                exercised, but that must be subject to scrutiny.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Scrutiny is especially important in the
                context of the kind of governmental arrangements in the
                Assembly, where effectively there is either no Opposition or a
                fairly limited one, because most of the parties enjoy some
                governmental authority. In the absence of a full-blown,
                full-time Opposition, there is an excellent scrutiny role for
                the Select Committee at Westminster.</p>

                revelations by the Audit Commission in relation to the

                the Northern&nbsp;Ireland Office are typical examples of what he

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes. It is hard to predict what might happen
                after devolution. The Opposition might consist of the
                Back-Benchers from all parties. They may scrutinise what
                ministerial teams are doing or they may not. They may refrain
                from going too far in case that makes life difficult for a
                colleague. Continuous scrutiny of finances is essential, and
                that is the one area on which there is a slight weakness in the
                report.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Molloy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to speak about this word that has been
                raised once again today — permanent. I want to draw attention
                to Mr McCartney’s assertion that sovereignty remains
                permanently at Westminster. He will be aware that in the Good
                Friday Agreement there is provision for a referendum the outcome
                of which would decide the future constitutional position of this
                country. It is up to the people of Ireland alone, and without
                outside impediment, to decide upon the future relationships and
                independence of the people of Ireland. Sovereignty is no longer
                permanently based at Westminster — that all changed as a
                result of the agreement reached in Belfast on Good Friday.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Maginness made the point that the notion
                of the sovereignty of Westminster is outdated, and I agree that
                it is, and that is a good reason for not including the issue in
                this document. Mr&nbsp;Maginness will know, as he is a lawyer,
                that should we include sovereignty as an issue in this document,
                reference will be made in the future to the fact that we put it
                there. This is the basis of Sinn Fein’s objection.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Not only is sovereignty an outdated issue but
                it must be borne in mind that sovereignty no longer rests
                totally with Westminster. Sovereignty is now shared with Dublin
                with the cross-community support of the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unionists are confused and have been for some
                time. They have no confidence in themselves and want to rely
                completely on Westminster to oversee and to look after them.
                They have no confidence in making decisions here and standing
                over them as they have done in the past.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Wilson referred to the issue of
                scrutiny. We have learnt from the past — prior to 1968 there
                was no scrutiny of the old Stormont. We have to ensure that
                there is scrutiny in order to help prevent the danger of
                slipping back into the old Stormont and the bad old days that we
                all remember — fifty years of Unionist misrule in this very
                Chamber.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We Nationalists also remember that
                Westminster did not do its job — it did not scrutinise
                properly — and so Sinn Fein wants to ensure that Dublin has a
                role in scrutinising the Assembly and making sure that it
                operates as set out in the Good Friday Agreement. Also, we see
                the European Community having scrutiny — through human-rights
                legislation — to ensure there is no discrimination against the
                Nationalist people in the way there was before.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unionists should not delude themselves any
                longer that sovereignty from Westminster is permanent. Once
                Scotland gets independence, once Wales goes for independence and
                once England returns to its pre-colonial position, as it will,
                we know exactly what we are going to be faced with — the
                break-up of the Union.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Union is no longer safe, and that will
                become quite clear with the advent of devolution. Unionists
                should catch themselves on and come to the Assembly with
                confidence in their own arguments. If they have not got
                confidence, they should debate matters outside in order to build
                confidence. Let them come here and ensure that devolution will
                see the break up of the Union as we presently know it. We will
                see this come about within the terms of the Good Friday
                Agreement, and Sinn Fein is here to debate with them.</p>

                but, at the end of the day, does the Assembly Member recognise
                that we are voting on the recommendations of the report rather
                than debating the wording of the paragraphs and inscriptions.
                Under the heading ‘The Key Principles’ the Committee
                recommends that</p>

                Many changes have been made to the report, and the wording of
                the document will come back to haunt us. That is why it is
                important that we agree its wording before forwarding it as an
                agreed report, which it is presently not.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee
                indicated that he had written to me on a number of matters which
                the Committee discussed but viewed as outside its remit. As
                requested by the Committee, through its Chairman, I have agreed
                to take appropriate steps to try to ensure that these matters
                are properly dealt with by the Assembly through its procedures.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McFarland:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All those Members who harbour a secret desire
                to be a Committee Chairman when the Assembly gets running, will
                have had a flavour today of what lies ahead of them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Members for their good wishes and, in
                particular, for the unaccustomed pat on the back from
                Mr&nbsp;McCartney, and his good grace on this occasion. I am not
                used to these things, as Members will appreciate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A couple of matters need clarification, and
                they are concerned with the way in which the Committee operated.
                For example, Mr&nbsp;McCrea raised the question of draft
                changing. I would argue that this is what committees are about.
                A committee deliberates on different drafts brought before it,
                makes a decision and changes wording. That is fair and valid. To
                portray it as removing things that were awkward is not a fair
                reflection of what happened.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second matter is the question, which
                Mrs&nbsp;Nelis raised, of things changing. The Committee had a
                number of meetings, and it was taking a lot of time because
                there were 18 members and many wished to speak. We were not
                progressing towards our deadline as fast as we wished and,
                therefore, it was decided that I, as Chairman, would hold a
                series of bilaterals to try to encapsulate the essentials of the
                report. This meant that at our last meeting we would only have
                to deal with those areas requiring a final decision.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a result of these bilateral meetings, a
                sentence was included — and it has been raised today — at
                the end of paragraph 9. In my view, this was valid because the
                parties had raised it. It was equally valid for Sinn Fein or,
                indeed, any other party, to object to this. We had a very
                lengthy debate on it on Friday week ago. We tried all sorts of
                methods to come to an agreed form of wording, and in the end we
                could not do that. It had to go to a vote, which was carried.
                Sinn Fein abstained, and the SDLP felt that it could not support
                the report. I think, in its defence, that it did not object to
                the wording, but sought an agreed wording.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My recollection, which is reflected in the
                minutes, is that I sought confirmation that the Committee wished
                the report to go forward as an agreed report, with the caveat in
                paragraph 9 that the decision had gone to a vote. As I recall,
                all the members there said &quot;Yes&quot;. There was no
                dissension or question of revisiting the matter. It would bode
                ill for the Assembly’s Committee system in the future to keep
                going back to things when there is disagreement with words here
                and there. If Members want to go through Committee work word by
                word, it will mean several years of work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The secret of operating a good Committee is
                that the Clerk and the Chairman do all the hard work and that
                the members have it presented and make the decisions. In our
                Clerk’s defence, I do not think he would agree with Mr
                McCartney that no hard work was done.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With my Committee hat off momentarily — I
                hope that this will not have the effect that Mr&nbsp;Adams’s
                saying &quot;Well done, David&quot; had on my party — I would
                like to commend in particular Mr&nbsp;S&nbsp;Wilson for shedding
                the light of reason amidst the Democratic Unionist Party.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend this magnificent report to the
                Assembly.</p>

                May I suggest that it is not put in the form of a request but
                that there is a positive ruling that these telephones are not
                permitted inside the Chamber, otherwise you are always going to
                be prone to some Member forgetting to turn it off or
                deliberating leaving it on. They should not be allowed inside

                Members transgress they usually, when it is drawn to their
                attention by the sounding of their device, quickly leave the
                Chamber, so I am not even in the position to send them out.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Initial Presiding Officer, Members of the
                Assembly and friends, I would like, first of all, to say that if
                I am seen to take out from beneath this podium a glass
                containing a transparent liquid, it should not be assumed that
                it contains gin and tonic, as it might do for the Chancellor of
                the Exchequer — it contains Northern Irish water. By the end
                of this afternoon’s session, I may need refreshment of another
                kind!</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am delighted to have the opportunity to
                talk to you this afternoon about the comprehensive spending
                review, and about what will eventually be the Assembly’s own
                budget. It is a measure of the distance we have travelled that
                the Assembly was no more than an idea when the comprehensive
                spending review was launched last year. Today, the Assembly is a
                reality, and, next year, it will have responsibility for much of
                the expenditure which we will be discussing this afternoon. As
                the elected representatives of all the men and women&nbsp;—
                and children — of Northern Ireland, Members of the Assembly
                will be responsible for, perhaps, some £8&nbsp;billion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As many Members will recall, I had the
                responsibility of chairing the final negotiations which led to
                strand one of the Agreement — namely, the arrangements for the
                establishment of the Assembly. So it is a great personal
                pleasure for me to be addressing the elected representatives of
                the people of Northern Ireland, and I wish them all well in
                their future deliberations. There will, of course, next year, be
                elected Assemblies for Scotland and for my own country, Wales,
                and I hope also, eventually, for the English regions. This great
                adventure in democracy, where people are represented by those
                who live amongst them, represents a tremendous advance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps one of the most significant issues
                with which the Assembly will have to deal in the coming years is
                the question of expenditure. That budget of £8 billion
                represents a huge responsibility for the Assembly, just as it
                currently represents a huge responsibility for the Secretary of
                State and myself and our Ministerial colleagues. The
                significance of that cannot be overstated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Aneurin Bevan, a fellow countryman and a
                great hero of mine, said, this applies to all political
                philosophies and certainly to government, that the language of
                socialism — or, one could say, the language of government —
                is the language of priorities. The comprehensive spending
                review, an exercise that was started by the Chancellor of the
                Exchequer, represents, not just in Northern Ireland but in the
                country as a whole, the priorities that the Government should
                have. That is precisely what will exercise your minds and
                attentions in the years ahead.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What priorities, as elected representatives,
                should you have? It is important to recognise that when people
                take the trouble to put a cross against your name, or, in the
                case of the Assembly, a number against your name, they are
                supporting you as an individual or as a party, and so there is a
                heavy responsibility on us to represent them to the best of our
                ability. The £8 billion which you will have to control when the
                Assembly is fully established will touch upon all aspects of
                life in Northern&nbsp;Ireland — health, education, local
                government, the environment and roads, among other things.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a result of the comprehensive spending
                review in the country as a whole, the Secretary of State asked
                the people of Northern Ireland through their political parties,
                voluntary organisations, the trade union movement, through
                businesses and the local authorities what priorities they felt
                should be dealt with in the coming years. So the consultation on
                the comprehensive spending review by no means began in the
                Assembly, but it will end here because the Assembly to which you
                all belong, has been asked what those priorities might be.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government produced a paper, which most
                of you received in Brussels last week, in which details of their
                spending proposals are set out. As I said, the comprehensive
                spending review was the most detailed public examination ever
                undertaken in the United&nbsp;Kingdom, and Northern Ireland has
                participated in that. The Secretary of State, my other
                ministerial colleagues and I have reached a view on how best to
                allocate the available resources.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In reaching this view, we have also taken
                into account the funding made available by the Chancellor’s
                economic initiative which was announced in May, the resources
                that we received from the New Deal, from the Welfare to Work
                programme and money from Europe, in particular the European
                peace and reconciliation programmes. There are additional
                resources earmarked for specific purposes including assisting
                the unemployed and helping to cement the process of
                reconciliation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Government is about priorities, and we have
                concluded that in Northern&nbsp;Ireland the priorities that we
                were elected on are essentially no different from the priorities
                on the mainland — with the exception of the money spent on
                security, about which I will say something later — which are
                health and education.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have come to the conclusion that what
                matters to people is the quality of life, in particular, how
                their children are educated, the quality of that education,
                together with the universality, the significance, the great
                ability of the Health Service to be able to deal with people’s
                health from the cradle to the grave. That is of vital
                significance to every man, woman and child in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That, if you have examined the papers in
                detail, illustrates where our priorities lie. You will see that
                the greatest increases by way of cash, or indeed by way of
                percentage, are in the health programme, specifically geared to
                reducing the waiting lists and in schools, specifically geared
                to lowering class sizes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those, coupled with the very significant and
                important aspect of ensuring that the security of people in
                Northern Ireland is dealt with properly, lie at the basis of
                those priorities. That does not mean that the services which are
                not covered by the health and education budgets are
                insignificant. Of course, they are not.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When I go round — as I have had the
                opportunity to do, though less so than my colleagues — and
                talk to people of all political persuasions in local authorities
                and elsewhere, they tell me that they also have important local
                priorities, whether roads, the environment, economic
                development, or whatever. We have chosen to concentrate on
                schools and hospitals in allocating the additional money.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a difficult question to answer —
                one which you will be charged with, as, indeed, will the local
                authorities — and that is &quot;How do you pitch your
                rate?&quot; There is, unique to Northern Ireland, a regional
                rate. The rating system has been abolished in Great Britain and
                replaced by the council tax although there is still a business
                rate there. You, of course, as an Assembly, when you are up and
                running, will be in a position to strike that rate in order to
                raise money to spend upon services for the benefit of the people
                of Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have assumed, as you will have read in the
                comprehensive spending review, a specific increase of 8% in the
                domestic regional rate, which we want to gear towards the huge
                and difficult problem that all of us jointly face, specifically
                in water and sewerage. You might think that that is a fairly
                unglamorous subject to discuss.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This morning my ministerial colleague
                Lord&nbsp;Dubs introduced his consultation paper on the future
                of the water and sewerage service. The sewerage system in
                Northern Ireland needs enormous capital, and one way of
                overcoming that problem without having to eat into your
                expenditure on other services is to ensure that the rate is
                struck at an appropriate level to deal with this particular
                problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The choice, ultimately, is yours. You may
                decide to increase the rate even more if you want to bring in
                more money to spend on services which you believe are
                significant or you may decide to reduce it. If you do reduce it,
                because there is a ceiling on the amount of money that we are
                allowed under the block, you will have to find money from
                elsewhere. However, at the moment we are assuming an increase of
                8% on the domestic regional rate and 5·5% on non-domestic rate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">May I briefly touch upon one or two of the
                issues that I dealt with. When we discuss these matters later,
                we can go into more detail.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The people of Northern Ireland are entitled
                to the very best health service that we can afford. The Health
                Service was born a few miles away from where I live and
                represent. It is probably one of the dearest things to me as a
                politician and, I am sure, to you as well. It affects the lives
                of everybody in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Public representatives and people throughout
                Northern Ireland have indicated that they do not want to see a
                reduction in the quality of the service offered by the Health
                Service. You will see, in the figures that you have been
                presented with, an increase in the amount planned to be spent on
                the Health Service. That amount does not include the
                £6&nbsp;million plus which, last week, the Chancellor of the
                Exchequer gave to Northern Ireland to deal with the problems of
                community care.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a major commitment to this key
                service. It will allow hospital waiting lists to be reduced
                below the level inherited from the last Government. There is an
                extra £74 million for community-care packages and another
                £30&nbsp;million for childcare to safeguard the well-being of
                children at risk.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have completed an exhaustive consultation
                on the future organisation of the Health Service, and it will
                fall to you to shape the Service for the health and the
                social-care challenges of the future. There may be difficult
                decisions to take, but that is what government is about and what
                representation is. Nevertheless, health is right up at the top
                of the agenda, as is education. It is one of my Government’s
                priorities and one of the priorities of those who represent the
                people of Northern Ireland. These extra resources will improve
                standards in schools, reduce class sizes, and, very
                significantly, expand pre-school education which is of vital
                importance in the mental and educational development of very
                young children, and can have a significant impact on their
                educational future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have proposed additions for further
                education, higher education, life-long learning and the
                Springvale initiative. We have given extra cash for arts,
                museums, youth and sport and the Odyssey Millennium project.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we have priorities, other things will not
                be on the same level. The package contains some reductions on
                the economic development side. I hasten to add that if this
                package is approved, £165 million will be spent in that area
                next year, but it has to be viewed in the context of other
                things: the Chancellor’s initiative, which is vital to the
                economic development of Northern Ireland, and the
                welfare-to-work programme, which is a very significant programme
                in terms of improving the training opportunities for young —
                and not so young — people. It all adds up to a significant
                economic development package for the people of Northern Ireland.
                There is still much to be done, but this is of great
                significance to the people here and to Members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the next three years we shall put an
                extra £84 million into the water and sewerage infrastructure to
                help to address European Union directives on water qualities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There will also be some reduction in housing
                expenditure so that additional resources can be released for
                schools and hospitals. We expect the Housing Association
                Movement to act in partnership with the Government to bring
                greater amounts of private finance here. Similarly, a number of
                capital receipts have come in on housing, and that has helped.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We recognise that the agricultural industry
                has experienced major difficulties in recent times. Significant
                additions to the agricultural programme have been proposed to
                respond to pressures on animal health, food safety, food
                processing, and marketing — as promised by the Prime Minister
                earlier this year — as well as to improve the services
                provided by the agricultural colleges and increase the
                protection against flooding. It was evident in Brussels last
                week how important agriculture is to Northern Ireland’s
                economy — the biggest single industry — and it is very
                important that we bend our minds to ensure that, as we go into
                the next century, as much as possible is done to improve and
                facilitate the agricultural industry here. The figures support
                that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of considerable interest to all Members is
                the expenditure relating to the Assembly. Here, in Cardiff and
                in Edinburgh, the two Assemblies and the Parliament must have
                money to exist. Provision has been made for various costs
                relating to the Assembly, the Office of the Executive, the
                North/South Ministerial Council and other costs associated with
                the Belfast Agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They are not insignificant sums. This year we
                expect to have to find about £9.5&nbsp;million for the Assembly
                alone, and thereafter approximately £14 million to £15 million
                each year. Those sums will have to be found from the fixed
                totals in the Northern&nbsp;Ireland block in the same way as for
                Wales and Scotland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The targeting social need and policy
                appraisal and fair treatment schemes are relevant to public
                spending allocations. Earlier this year the Government
                relaunched the TSN&nbsp;initiative as new TSN — New Labour,
                New TSN — with a particular focus on the needs of the
                unemployed. A review of TSN in each Department is currently
                being carried out by external consultants. In putting together
                the spending proposals, we have taken account of the potential
                targeting social need and PAFT implications. Our policies on
                higher education and on Springvale, Odyssey and many other
                areas, such as welfare to work, strongly support TSN.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the consultation paper we have tried to
                strike a balance between providing sufficient detail for
                meaningful consultations and a not too voluminous document. The
                question is whether the Assembly agrees with the overall shape
                of the priorities that we have provisionally decided. The
                overall spending totals are fixed, so any suggestions for
                changes have to identify gainers or losers. This is an
                unprecedented consultation on spending plans. It represents the
                Assembly’s first opportunity to consider public spending
                allocations to programmes. It gives the Assembly an indication
                of what it will face in the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It will be for the Assembly to decide how to
                respond to what I have said. It may decide that the debate is
                sufficient, or Members may write to me individually or
                collectively. We need to complete the process in the next couple
                of weeks to begin finalising that programme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Assembly for the opportunity to
                deal with the huge problems of prioritisation. In view of all
                the problems that Northern&nbsp;Ireland has faced over the years
                and will face in future, it is a heavy responsibility on me, but
                it will be a heavier one on Members of the Assembly. That
                process applies particularly here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not elected by people in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland, but Members will be accountable to the
                electorate here for their decisions. That is what democracy is
                about. Spending priorities are the core of representing people
                in a democratic society. I am privileged and proud to have had
                the opportunity to see democracy in Northern&nbsp;Ireland for
                the first time in many years.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many Members want to ask questions. I repeat
                that each will have one opportunity. There must be no extensive
                statements, and it will not be appropriate to intervene when the
                Minister is replying. Questions will be taken in batches of six.
                I shall allow as many as possible.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Nesbitt:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My question is about the regional rate. The
                Minister mentioned an 8 per cent increase. That is about £83
                million extra to be paid to be paid by ratepayers from a base
                level of £200 million.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is an astronomical increase for a
                particular phase of the water and sewerage system. However, I
                accept that the expenditure is necessary. Given that we are
                moving towards resource accounting — costs are allocated over
                the useful life of an asset — does the Minister think it is
                fair to charge ratepayers for something which will only be of
                benefit many years hence? Could we not be more imaginative?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGrady:</p>

                finance for health and education.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me draw the Minister’s attention to the
                Chancellor’s economic package, announced last May. This was
                understood to be additional to existing resources, yet in
                paragraph 8 and in other places he says that there is
                ring-fencing for £130 million. Can he confirm that up to
                £100&nbsp;million of this so-called additional money will come
                from the privatisation of the Belfast harbour — that, as it
                were, the family silver is being sold off? Will the Assembly be
                able to express a view on this privatisation? I understand that
                it is to be rushed through before Christmas. That is a total
                disgrace.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gibson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate the Minister on his
                presentation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does he know how welcome the Chancellor’s
                initiative and the £12·5&nbsp;million of ring-fenced money for
                the A5 road are? Is he aware that, prior to that announcement, a
                backlog of work to the tune of £55&nbsp;million had built up in
                the western region? Recently, in the House of Lords, the Duke of
                Abercorn highlighted the sentiments of everyone in West Tyrone
                when he pointed out that the region has no ports, harbours or
                airports. Its lifeline is the A5 — the Londonderry-Ballygawley
                road — which has suffered from a massive £35&nbsp;million
                underspend.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister assure the Assembly that
                the West will no longer suffer financial hardship, that there
                will be equality of treatment and that the lifeline for West
                Tyrone will be brought up to the standards necessary for modern

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister to what has been
                called a consultation exercise. I trust that it will indeed be
                consultation and not purely a cosmetic exercise.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am perturbed at the proposal to increase
                the regional rate by 8%. Does the Minister agree that we all
                have a duty to try to achieve open and accountable government,
                and that any fiscal measures that are used to provide for an
                increase in public expenditure should be seen by the electorate
                to be open and transparent?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have been involved in local government for
                25 years, and I can tell the House that every local authority in
                Northern Ireland abhors the regional rate. It is a totally
                nebulous tax, based on assumption, and it is impossible to
                understand how it is calculated. It is disgraceful to use it as
                the vehicle for increasing public expenditure and to restrict
                this House in such a way. If we are to have open and accountable
                government, it would be much more satisfactory to have
                tax-varying or tax-raising powers that are also open and
                accountable to the electorate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister said that when he returned home
                he did not want anyone ringing him up. We will still be here and
                accountable to the people, and they will wish to know how their
                money is being spent.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The water and sewerage systems are in their
                present state because of the neglect of previous Governments. A
                more accountable measure should be used to raise the necessary
                funding.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the increase in expenditure on
                education. How will that money be used to address problems in
                education?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland has record achievements in
                GCSE and A-level examinations, but, at the other end of the
                spectrum, significant numbers of people leave education without
                any qualifications. That means that those people were either
                insufficiently intelligent or that the schools they attended
                failed totally in their responsibilities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can Members be assured that some of this
                increased expenditure on education will be used to address that
                problem?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No matter how the education system develops,
                we need to retain the excellence of our grammar schools. There
                is a problem at tertiary level.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Please bring your questions to a conclusion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Roche:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland has two reasonably
                performing universities, but they do not have a high status
                either in the league table of universities or internationally.
                Therefore they have not attracted the top Northern Ireland
                students, and that has led to a significant brain drain over the
                past 30 years. I hope that the increase in expenditure will be
                directed towards those problems.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Murphy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful for all the comments that have
                been made. I will make one or two general points about some of
                the questions that have been asked. I have noted those Members
                who asked questions involving constituency details or more
                technical aspects. I will write to them individually in more
                detail. Although I am the Minister responsible for finance, I am
                not the Minister responsible for education and health et cetera.
                There are policies about which Members need further information
                and they may rest assured that they will get information back
                from the Government on those issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I will do my best on the questions
                that have been raised.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will take Mr&nbsp;Nesbitt’s question with
                Mr Close’s because they both refer to the regional rate and to
                the eight per cent increase to which I referred. Let me repeat
                that this increase is, as the Government suggest the best
                compromise we can have to get proper spending on those matters
                to which I referred – water and sewerage. It is not the only
                way, however. You cannot, for example, choose to spend less on
                something else and then spend it on water and sewerage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You can, of course, choose to spend the rate
                increase on something else. But no one wants to pay rates. For
                10 years I had to get up in my local authority chamber in
                Torfaen, South Wales, as Chairman of the Finance Committee and
                present a budget. I always ended by saying that as a consequence
                of the budget, rates would never decrease. The rates were
                increased to pay for this and for that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But it is the second point that is
                significant. If you tell people that rates are to be used to
                improve the infrastructure, promote jobs and industry and
                enhance the quality of their lives, they understand, but they
                will still not want to pay.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Nesbitt asked if there should be
                spending now on water and sewerage as the results of such
                spending will only be seen much later. Capital spending is about
                the future. We must think of that future. The problem that we
                are facing, after so many years of neglect, is that the water
                and sewerage system needs special attention. It is, in many
                ways, the least glamorous, the least political thing, that you
                can think about. But it is vital to the infrastructure of
                society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close was saying that the method of
                taxation which the Government have chosen is flawed. In a sense
                I agree. The rating system is a flawed system. There are all
                sorts of difficulties attached to it. The actual amount,
                however, that is paid by people in Northern Ireland compared to
                the amount the people in Great&nbsp;Britain pay by way of local
                taxation is less. It is important that if you have a regional
                rate, you should determine its value.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Wales there would be no such rate. There
                is no income possibility for the Welsh Assembly. In Scotland
                there will be a tax-varying power. I am not giving an opinion on
                whether the Assembly should have a tax-raising power. It was not
                part of the Agreement and in discussions afterwards, there was
                no enthusiasm for such a power. Thus there is none.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is the regional rate — the only
                method by which the Assembly has an opportunity to raise income.
                Indeed, were the Assembly to be given the opportunity to raise
                funds by local income tax — some would regard that as fairer;
                others would have doubts — such a tax would be imposed in any
                event, and probably for the same purpose, namely the water and
                sewerage systems.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a flawed systems method, but Members
                will have to decide, if they do not want to put that rate up,
                where they will take the money from, if the issue of the water
                and sewerage system is to be addressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On Mr Nesbitt’s point about accounting,
                Government accounting, at present, means that the capital has to
                be scored up front, and the necessary expenditure has to be
                funded. He asked about consultation. Lord Dubs will consult the
                Assembly on the future of water and sewerage facilities in
                Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGrady referred to the Chancellor’s
                economic package and to the fact that it is additional. He was
                worried about the sale of Belfast harbour. I can confirm, and
                the Chancellor has also made it clear, that part of this package
                depends upon the results of the sale of Belfast harbour.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is unique for the Chancellor to retain the
                receipts from such a sale; normally such receipts go into a pool
                and are swallowed up by the budgetary process in Whitehall. That
                is not the case on this occasion. The receipts are to be
                ring-fenced and used in Northern Ireland for the infrastructure
                and the other works referred to. However, it is not true that
                the harbour will be privatised by December, and it is true that
                Lord Dubs will consult the Assembly for its views on such a
                course of action.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gibson referred to the problems of the
                west and the difficulties with transport. He welcomed the A5
                improvements, but indicated, like many people who represent
                Tyrone and the west of Northern Ireland, that there is much more
                to be done. He also indicated that the lifeline of that part of
                the province depends very much upon a proper road-transport
                system. He, and others, made that point to me when I visited
                Omagh Council in the summer, and I understand its significance.
                I am sure that when the Assembly decides upon packages for
                transport and roads, that point will be borne in mind. Some of
                the Chancellor’s package will be going to those areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms O’Hagan referred to a number of issues,
                some of which I will write to her about, but I will explain the
                Northern Ireland Office budget in relation to law and order. One
                of the reasons why that budget has not been reduced in the
                coming year is that compensation for Omagh and other places has
                to be paid for out of it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also do not know what the outcome of the
                Patten Commission will be regarding the restructuring of the
                police force. We do not know what the Criminal Justice
                Commission will ask us to do — time will tell. I will just
                make two points.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, if the security situation in Northern
                Ireland improves month by month and year by year, inevitably it
                could be argued that there will be savings. However, Members
                will know as well as I do that such savings are most likely to
                occur in manpower. Redundancy payments and payments related to
                early retirement will have to be paid for, so it is not so
                simple. Secondly, the Northern Ireland budget and the budget
                that the Assembly will eventually deal with, which combined come
                to some £9 billion, will, after devolution, be separated.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly will not, for example, have to
                pay for compensation. That will fall upon the Northern Ireland
                Office budget. It will not come out of the budget for housing or
                education or whatever. Where there will have to be some very
                difficult negotiations will be with the Treasury, and with the
                Government centrally, in London on where the division of an
                overall amount would be made, between the Northern Ireland block
                on the one hand and the Assembly block on the other.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But Northern Ireland will not be on its own
                in that because the Welsh and the Scottish will have to undergo
                a similar negotiation — I was going to call it a battle — as
                well. Of course, the Northern Ireland budget, by virtue of the
                security input, is much higher than the budget in Wales and, to
                a lesser extent, in Scotland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Roche raised the important question of
                standards in schools and, of course, it is a huge budget. I
                dealt with the education brief as a shadow Minister, and for the
                six months or so that I held that brief, I was deeply impressed
                by the quality and standards of education in Northern Ireland.
                At the same time I was unimpressed by the fact that there is
                clearly more work to be done in many schools in Northern
                Ireland, whether it be in terms of the school buildings or the
                equipment they need, the computers that have to go in, and we
                have already tackled this to a certain extent, the class-size
                issue. As a former teacher myself, I can say that what is most
                significant and leads to success in the classroom is the number
                of children in it: the bigger the class, the less chance a child
                has. That may be a truism, but it has been forgotten for a long
                time, and that is why, in my view, the most significant thing
                that can be done to improve a child’s education is to ensure
                that the class size is smaller.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The future of grammar schools and the
                education system itself is something that you are going to have
                to debate in the months and years ahead. We have put into the
                budget a very large amount of money for the programme to support
                the schools in areas of social need, for training for primary
                teachers and for training for principals of schools, which is
                very important — when I was young, principals were not trained
                to manage. We were trained to teach; that is what attracted us
                in the first place. Now they have to do both, and sometimes no
                teaching at all. That is a mistake; all principals should teach
                now and again, as all head teachers should, just to make sure
                that they understand what is going on. It is very important that
                principals of schools get the opportunity for such training.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition to that, we are looking at a
                strategy for promoting good behaviour in schools, a development
                planning process and a host of other things as well. The idea
                behind all of this is to improve standards in schools so that no
                matter where your home is, no matter how poor or deprived you
                may be, the opportunity you get as a young boy or girl is not
                squandered because of the system and you can develop your
                potential. That is why everybody, no matter what community or
                place he comes from in Northern Ireland, believes in the value
                of education.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister’s reference to future
                security spending levels fully take into account the levels of
                inflation that have been estimated and the undertakings given by
                the Prime Minister with regard to potential severance payments
                for members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary? Is there likely to
                be up to a £4 million underfunding for the most recent pay
                award and another cut of around £24 million in current spending
                at a time when 20,000 troops will, if the present reduction in
                violence is maintained, be withdrawn?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Would it not be common sense to ensure that
                the levels of operational policing are enhanced? Would the

                million reduction in funding?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gallagher:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The allocation for home-school transport
                arrangements does not allow for the present arrangements to
                continue beyond the end of the next school year. Thereafter, the
                intention is to charge pupils over 16 for transport to school.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Three years ago the Department of Education
                proposed a similar initiative which would have severely
                penalised pupils in rural areas. In my own constituency, some of
                the pupils would have been required to pay £700 for transport
                to school. Tampering with school transport arrangements
                invariably hits pupils in rural areas hardest and is unlikely to
                achieve worthwhile savings, as some research undertaken in the
                west of the province shows. Will the Minister withdraw this
                particular suggestion?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Furthermore, in relation to higher education
                and the allocation of an extra 2,000 places may I point out that
                we have to see this in the context of the current year where
                students have to pay a £1,000 tuition fee and where maintenance
                grants have been cut in half. From next year maintenance grants
                will be replaced by student loans. Students face the prospect of
                leaving university with a millstone of debt around their necks.
                It is very discouraging for young people from poorer backgrounds
                who might progress into third-level education. Is the Minister
                aware of the concerns that many Members have about future higher
                education places being available and filled, not on merit, but
                on the ability of people from privileged families to pay for
                them?</p>

                Sewerage Service. When in opposition, the Labour Party opposed
                privatization of national institutions. Will the Minister
                confirm that the current Government now supports the
                privatization of the Water Service? As I understand it, a paper
                is being prepared by Westminster civil servants at this very
                moment.Could it be that the proposed water charges of £35 to
                £70 per household, is a pay-off for the fat cats? How can he
                justify that increase? Furthermore, how does the Minister
                reconcile the double standards that the Labour Party has so very

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Minister, in the spending review you have
                referred to four key supporting aims and it seems to me that
                while they are all very worthwhile, they tend to be vague and
                there is not as much emphasis on targeting social needs,
                although you made mention of it earlier.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What concerns me is how this can be worked
                out in practice. Take my own constituency, West Belfast, for
                example. If it were to be designated a health action zone, then
                extra resources will be required for the Health Service.
                Introduction of the Children Order will put greater stresses on
                the criminal justice system in the area. It may even lead to the
                closure of one of the homes in the area. Extra resources would,
                therefore, also be needed in the social services budget.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">May I point out that your colleague endorsed,
                just a couple of days ago, the need in West Belfast. You need to
                take account of this need in the four key aims and I would like
                to know how you actually measure social need in a constituency

                clarity surrounding cuts in community development. Minister, you
                mentioned the Springvale and Odyssey projects. This paper goes
                on to say there is scope for adjustment to existing urban
                regeneration community development baselines to help support
                higher priority projects elsewhere. I think that nowhere could
                you say that either Odyssey or Springvale has been community
                led. One is an education programme and the other is a mixture of
                leisure and other areas. Particularly in relation to the Odyssey
                project, it could not be said that it is supported from a
                community development point of view, by most people in east

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We welcome the priorities which the Minister
                has set for health and education, and particularly for
                pre-school education. I, like Mr Hutchinson of the PUP, am
                concerned about the ambiguity over whether certain areas of
                expenditure will be cut in order to accommodate these
                priorities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We want to focus on training, which the
                Minister mentioned. He said that existing programmes could be
                &quot;reconfigured&quot; to emphasise the new priority given to
                skills enhancement. I would like to know what is meant by this.
                In particular, we would like to know whether the Action for
                Community Employment (ACE) programme, which Northern Ireland
                people have a great attachment to, will be totally swallowed up
                by the new deal or whether it can be properly resurrected as a
                fine example of an existing training programme?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also seek clarification on a second point,
                which Members will appreciate from their visit to Brussels. The
                Minister had budgeted for the peace and reconciliation programme
                to run beyond the year 2000 into 2001 and 2002. While Members
                are all lobbying to try to keep it, we cannot understand why the
                Minister has budgeted for it up until 2002 when we understood
                that it was to end in the year 2000.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Coulter raised the issue of inflation and
                the question of the Northern Ireland Police Authority’s grant
                for law and order over the next few years. It is currently being
                held at broadly the same level as that for this financial year.
                That means, as the Member knows, that the Police Authority and
                the RUC will have to make some efficiency savings to cover
                police pay. But, generally speaking, there is no great
                difference between the grant now and the grant for the year
                ahead.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I did say, and I repeat, that we do not know
                what the Police Commission will recommend. We do not know what
                the security situation will be like in the coming years. Suffice
                it to say that current policing levels in no way put at risk the
                security of people in Northern Ireland. But, of course, we await
                with interest the Commission’s recommendations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gallagher referred to two things: the
                question of home-school transport charging and higher education.
                On the first point, he rightly refers to the fact there is to be
                no change next year, which is the first of a three year
                programme. It is in the second and third years that the decision
                will have to be taken. I fully accept his point about rural
                areas, but ultimately it will be for the Assembly to determine
                how high a priority that is in education as a whole. Across the
                water in England, Scotland and Wales, there are varying methods
                of school-transport support, according to local circumstances.
                The Assembly may feel, for example, that, particularly in rural
                areas, some special help should be given because of size. That
                is just a suggestion for the second and third years, but,
                ultimately, that will be for the Assembly to decide.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the point about higher
                education, I sympathise entirely. I was the first member of my
                family, on either side, who went to university. I understand the
                significance of being able to ensure that you do not have to
                worry about the financial consequences of going to higher and
                tertiary education. I do not think that it is going to be as bad
                a picture as Mr&nbsp;Gallagher painted. For example, it is
                estimated that only 25% of students will pay the £1000 tuition
                fee. Some 35% will pay less than that, and 40% will pay nothing
                at all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also have to bear in mind what we mean by
                post 16-17 education. Many people did not benefit from advanced
                further education. We concentrated so heavily on those taking
                degree courses that people in advanced education, which was not
                at degree level, lost out. We need to ensure that there is
                fairness and equity, so that as many as possible can benefit
                from it.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon referred to the privatisation of
                the water and sewerage services. There will be full consultation
                with my colleague, Lord Dubs, and the use of private finance in
                public-private partnerships is something which the Government
                certainly believe is the right way to go about such matters,
                particularly where major infrastructure is concerned. There is
                nothing wrong with that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is, of course, the option of complete
                privatization — and that is one of the options open — but we
                have made no decision on it. It is very much a matter for
                consultation before we decide what to do.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Maskey referred to targeting social need
                and policy appraisal and fair treatment. Of course those schemes
                are vital — very significant indeed. In terms of the
                measurement to which he referred, there are technical means of
                measuring relative needs. We can, for example, use indicators
                such as unemployment — and these are used in targeting social
                need assessments, as he knows.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I think he is concerned that these schemes
                will, in some way or other, get lost in the whole budgetary
                exercise. I can assure him that that is not the case. It is very
                much in the mind of the Government — and I am sure it will be
                in the mind of the Assembly — that Targeting Social Need and
                Policy Appraisal and Fair Treatment be kept very much to the
                fore.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hutchinson referred to cuts in community
                development. It is not only the question of Odyssey or
                Springvale, to which I referred, but also of improving, as I
                hope we are, education, schools, areas of social need or the
                health of people in more deprived communities. If we look at the
                welfare to work situation we can see that all these things can
                be looked at by way of helping people in areas which need the
                help particularly because of the social difficulties they face.
                There are many areas, including his own, in Northern Ireland,
                which we need to look at. I will, of course, write to him in
                detail regarding some of those matters, but we also have to bear
                in mind the European programmes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I refer to Ms Morrice’s point about the
                peace and reconciliation programme. That will eventually come to
                an end — of course it will. As far as that problem is
                concerned, part of our visit last week was to see what can
                replace the current European programmes to ensure that we get
                the best possible deal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not want to see any programme swallowed
                up by the new deal, as the Member put it, but it is very
                important to understand the enormous help that has come through
                the welfare to work programme, which the Chancellor of the
                Exchequer announced. We really do need to try to understand the
                whole picture in training terms. My experience over the years is
                that it is a very complicated picture and that sometimes people
                can slip through the net on training. It is important to look at
                the whole situation as far as training is concerned —
                including welfare to work. I understand Members’ concerns and
                will ensure that they are met as best as possible.</p>

                redevelopment land, currently controlled by the Belfast Harbour

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My question relates to something that has
                already been raised — the impact of the reduction of the
                targeting social need and policy appraisal and fair treatment
                schemes. I listened to the Minister’s reply but it does occur
                to me that the welfare to work programme is being managed as
                part of an inter-departmental budget at UK level and will,
                therefore, be outside the scope of this consultation and, in a
                sense, outside the control of the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since this is to outweigh the negative impact
                of the reduction of the targeting social need and policy
                appraisal and fair treatment schemes, we could find ourselves
                being unable to deliver on the commitment to equality which is
                part of the Agreement. Perhaps the Minister could deal with
                that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The decision to treat the Springvale project
                as a private finance initiative will also place it outside the

                Northern Ireland’s largest industry. Almost every sector of
                that industry is currently in crisis. Farming incomes are
                falling dramatically, and farmers do not know where to turn.
                During the recent crisis in the pig farming industry, the French
                Government introduced a series of measures to support their
                producers. These included special payments to farmers in
                difficulty, special arrangements for pig farmers and a package
                worth 30 million francs to support farming families affected by
                the crisis. What hope can the Minister offer to this industry in

                sale of the Port of Belfast. In the Chancellor’s statement, it
                is stated quite clearly that the Belfast-Newry road, and other
                new projects, will be partly funded by the proceeds of the
                transfer of the Port of Belfast from the public sector to a
                public-private partnership. However, in the Minister’s
                statement, it is made clear that, if these receipts do not
                materialise, these projects would only proceed if funding on
                other Northern Ireland projects were reduced. Where does the
                truth lie? The people of Northern Ireland did not derive any
                benefit from the sale by the previous Government of Belfast
                Airport and Northern Ireland Electricity. The best way to fund
                these new projects is to use the existing profits from the Port

                of, for example, the crisis in the agriculture industry, as
                referred to earlier by Rev&nbsp;William&nbsp;McCrea? This
                crisis, especially in the beef industry, was brought about by
                the negligence and mismanagement of the previous Government, and
                is, therefore, not the responsibility of anyone in the Northern
                Irish beef industry, which had the best system in the United
                Kingdom for tracing cattle. Yet, in spite of this, the Province
                suffered disproportionately from the European Union beef ban
                because of the relative size of the beef industry here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the point made by Ms Rodgers,
                the Welfare to Work programme is a central Government project,
                but it is taking people from welfare to work — and some of the
                Welfare to Work programmes are of questionable economic value
                — while other policies are running into the ground (people who
                have worked assiduously for generations in the agriculture
                industry).</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Murphy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am getting the message as far as Belfast
                Harbour is concerned. There are a couple of detailed points in
                reference to the issues raised by Mr&nbsp;Beggs, Mr McCartney
                and Mr Neeson. The land bank is clearly an important issue. The
                Belfast Harbour Commissioners are to bring forward their own
                scheme which will have to be assessed by the Government to
                ensure that the land arrangements are properly considered and to
                ensure competition. Larne, as you know, is already owned by the
                private sector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to Mr&nbsp;Neeson’s query about
                the proceeds of the proposed sale, the estimates, because of the
                commercial difficulties and the commercial significance of it,
                have to be confidential at this stage. Not all of the Chancellor’s
                initiative has been funded from the sale of the port. The
                Chancellor is making substantial funding available from central
                resources but receipts also make a contribution. As the port is
                not publicly owned it is not open to the Government to use its
                profits to augment the Northern Ireland block.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will appraise Lord&nbsp;Dubs and the
                Secretary of State of the views that have been expressed here
                today, and you will have an opportunity to discuss this matter
                again in the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to TSN and PAFT, overall there is
                no reduction in funding — quite the opposite. There are large
                increases in education and health, and Welfare to Work targets
                the needs of the individual. There is surely no better way of
                ensuring that TSN objectives are met than by going to the
                individual concerned. I do accept the significance of TSN and,
                in particular, new TSN. I have not dealt with this policy
                personally, but I am informed by my colleagues who have dealt
                with the policy, that it is very significant in what it can and
                what it is hoped it will achieve. As far as the budget is
                concerned, both those areas act as a backdrop to those decisions
                we have to take on socio-economic matters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev&nbsp;William&nbsp;McCrea referred to how
                important agriculture is in Northern Ireland and how incomes
                have been slashed over the months and years gone by. The
                Government have taken various measures to alleviate these
                problems, for example, pig producers were assisted through a pig
                welfare slaughter scheme and compensation was also provided for
                flagged herds. This assistance totalled nearly £1·2 million.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also aware of the difficulties that are
                faced as a consequence of the fire at the pig production factory
                in Ballymoney and the significance of that fire. It is important
                that we consider how best to deal with this problem. If Mr&nbsp;McCrea
                looks at the budget for the next three years he will note that
                the CSR provides support for services worth £25 million, for
                example, in testing and meat inspection. This should instil
                confidence in the agricultural industry, particularly in dairy
                products, which is absolutely necessary.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After talking to people in Europe last week
                it is our view that the Northern Ireland farmers will be
                recognised for the very important changes that have occurred in
                the industry in Northern Ireland and how the farmers have dealt
                with these crises. Mr&nbsp;McCrea will see, if he reads the
                budget, that these problems are not forgotten. The Government
                are certainly conscious, as I am sure the Assembly is, of the
                importance of agriculture to the well-being of the many
                thousands of people who live and work on the land in Northern
                Ireland.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Murphy is aware that, under the Agreement,
                the Government have committed themselves to passing legislation
                to ensure that Irish-medium education will be available. The
                viability criteria have been adjusted so that schools can more
                easily be established where there is demand. He will also be
                aware that in my constituency Welsh-medium education is
                flourishing, so I will place no impediment in the way of those
                who wish their children to be educated through the medium of the
                Irish language.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have covered most of the points, but I will
                write to Members on some of the detail on points which have been
                raised.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Carson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With reference to our roads and transport
                system, the Chancellor’s economic package will provide £87
                million — though spending is dependant on receipts from the
                transfer of the port of Belfast to the private sector. The port
                of Belfast is vital to the strategic, economic importance of
                this Province and must not be regarded as a throwaway bargain; I
                must emphasise that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The comprehensive spending review allocations
                will reinforce this package by a further £11 million for roads
                operation and maintenance. Will the Minister confirm that no
                long-term provision has been made within this three year
                programme for essential long-deferred items? I could give him
                quite a few examples from South Tyrone.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Farren:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government, in presenting this
                consultation paper, quite rightly remind us that their
                overarching aim is to achieve peace, stability and prosperity.
                In the first sub-paragraph following this, they commit
                themselves to ensuring the full implementation of the Good
                Friday Agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the light of that, I would like to point
                out what I see as a serious omission in the Spending Review.
                With respect to allocations that will arise out of the
                establishment of the Civic Forum and the North/South Ministerial
                Council, there is a brief reference to the office of the
                Executive on the North/South Council. I take the allocations
                indicated there to refer specifically to the secretarial aspect
                of the Council, but with respect to the North/South
                implementation bodies, I think that we could have expected some
                more information on what might need to be allocated in that
                area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My question refers to paragraph 31 and the
                Trade, Industry and Energy Section. There is to be a reduction
                of approximately 4% over 3 years with respect to this area.
                Given the reference to energy in the title of this section, the
                imminence of reports dealing with the possible extension of the
                gas supply to the north- west and the possibility of the
                extension of gas supplies should an interconnection with
                Scotland be provided and a link between Belfast and the border,
                I am particularly concerned that the capital expenditure
                required to meet such necessary investments might not be
                forthcoming due to the reductions signalled in this section of
                the review.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hay:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask the same question as Mr&nbsp;Farren
                about the extension of the natural gas pipeline to the rest of
                the Province, and especially to the north and north-west. There
                is a strong political lobby to ensure that the extension takes
                place. The Government have completed a feasibility study on
                natural gas for those areas. However it was a narrow study and
                we, the representatives of the north and north-west, want
                assurances that natural gas will be supplied to the rest of the
                Province. We have no problem about gas for the Greater Belfast
                area, but for the sake of industry and economic development, and
                in terms of social issues, it is important that the rest of the
                Province gets a natural gas pipeline. I ask the Minister to set
                money aside for that.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Nelis:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the recent economic forum in Derry, which
                was organised by Derry City Council, it was stated that since
                1939 that area has had the highest unemployment in the Six
                Counties. Strabane has an equally bad record. Unemployment is
                directly related to ill-health and poverty, and one of the
                objectives of the review is to enhance the quality of life for
                people in the north and invigorate TSN initiatives. How can that
                be achieved if expenditure on training and on tackling
                unemployment is to drop by 4% over the next three years? That
                percentage allows for inflation. It would be useful to have
                information on how TSN decisions ensure the funding is correctly
                targeted. I join my comrades on Derry City Council in putting
                the case for natural gas. It will help to tackle our long-term
                endemic unemployment.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Birnie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Industrial development is mentioned on pages
                12 and 13 of the review. A substantial real-terms reduction in
                expenditure is proposed. It would be helpful for such documents
                to make explicit assumptions about inflation. How does that
                reduction, especially in the context of selective financial
                assistance, relate to the ongoing review of the structures of
                the main industrial development agencies, to the recent
                performance of the IDB and LEDU and to the Department of
                Economic Development’s economic strategy review? That review
                is not yet complete, and we, as democratic representatives, have
                not had the chance to contribute to it.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Byrne:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How can the stated aims of sustained economic
                growth and an improvement in the Northern&nbsp;Ireland economy
                be achieved in the light of the projected reduction in the
                budget of the Department of Economic Development? I welcome the
                fact that there will be 2,000 extra higher education places over
                the next three years. I hope that Tyrone will not be the only
                county without full-time higher education provisions. TSN and
                PAFT should ensure that the county town of Tyrone gets some
                places.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Murphy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I will respond to Mr&nbsp;McCartney’s
                point about access to the reserve, which I have not completed
                but have not forgotten. The Member knows that it is always
                possible, if there is a genuine and UK-wide crisis, to obtain
                certain moneys from the reserve. Indeed, the cost of BSE and the
                difficulties associated with that crisis were a drain on the
                reserve. However, it is not designed for local emergencies,
                except where the scale is such that it is impossible for the
                amount to be met from internal resources from the block. It
                depends on the circumstances of the issue we are dealing with.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney and Ms&nbsp;Carson referred
                again to the question of the Port of Belfast, and in particular
                the provision for long-term items. The port would certainly not
                be sold for a bargain. Water, education capital, and roads
                capital are examples of long-term items. Again, we would be more
                than willing to listen to the views of Members of the Assembly
                — and they have expressed them strongly this afternoon — on
                how best to deal with this particular issue and I will be taking
                that message back.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Farren referred to two things. First he
                referred to the Belfast Agreement and the commitments made there
                regarding the Civic Forum and the North/South Ministerial
                Councils and the expenditure necessary on them as a consequence
                of the Agreement. The Assembly may rest assured that there will
                be proper provision made within the estimates in the budget for
                such commitments in the Agreement, and we will ensure that that
                will be visible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Farren’s second point, also raised by
                Mr&nbsp;Hay and Mrs&nbsp;Nelis, referred to the lack of Natural
                Gas in the north of Northern Ireland. A year or so ago I talked
                to Derry City Council and they were very strong in their view of
                how important it was that Natural Gas be extended to the
                north-west. Until I came to Northern Ireland as Minister, I was
                unaware that there were no such facilities. As someone who uses
                gas for cooking and heating I can understand people’s views on
                this. There is no actual provision in these plans for new gas
                pipelines. As Members will know, it is very expensive and will
                need to be critically appraised.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It will be a matter for the Assembly to
                decide whether it is possible, by some method or other, to
                persuade the Treasury to increase the block grant or to ensure
                that there is some sort of agreement, achieved by negotiations
                with private companies, to bring it through. I understand that
                the case is there and the Assembly, ultimately, will have to
                find such funding but certainly not within the estimates as they
                are presented today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Nelis also referred to unemployment. Let
                me remind her that the welfare-to-work programme will provide
                £240&nbsp;million for Northern Ireland during the current
                Parliament — a very large amount indeed. That amount is set
                against a general picture of falling unemployment and increases
                in health and education. I do not underestimate the huge
                significance of the need — particularly as we move into a more
                peaceful setting — to retrain people and to give young people
                the skills necessary to ensure that they can have a fulfilling
                and useful life in the next century. That is very significant
                for us all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr&nbsp;Birnie referred to the Industrial
                Development Board. The cuts in the budget are relatively modest.
                We will still be spending £165&nbsp;million in 1999-2000. We
                believe that the more peaceful climate, and the progress made in
                this Assembly, will strengthen the attractiveness of Northern
                Ireland as a good investment location. The strategy to which he
                refers is, indeed, under way. The IDB’s level of assistance to
                industry will remain very competitive and will continue to
                provide a high level of support for attracting new inward
                investment — a point made by Mr&nbsp;Byrne also.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not underestimate the work being done by
                the Department of Economic Development or by the IDB. Indeed the
                recent 11-city tour was hugely significant, and I hope that much
                will come of it.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The estimate is reasonable and, over the next
                few years, it should provide sufficient funds for industrial
                investment. A report on the IDB and regional development
                generally will soon be issued.</p>

                that more will be spent on improving Northern&nbsp;Ireland’s
                water and sewerage infrastructure. Last week some homes in my
                constituency were flooded for the fifth time in a year and
                sewage was running through the houses because of the inadequacy
                of the sewerage system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The question of urban regeneration has been
                highlighted on a number of occasions. As Billy&nbsp;Hutchinson
                has said, expenditure on the Odyssey project will be offset by
                urban regeneration programmes. Nothing specific is mentioned in
                the paper. Which urban regeneration programmes will be affected,
                and will urban regeneration in East Belfast generally be
                affected by directing funds to the flagship project?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In their recent Green Paper, the Government
                emphasised the need to change the emphasis on transport. The
                Odyssey project is a good example of decisions being made ahead
                of changes that may be needed to public transport. The
                Department has cut car parking spaces by 3,000, on the basis
                that there will be adequate public transport to facilitate the
                Odyssey project in East Belfast. If planning decisions are made
                on the basis of adequate public transport, what money has been
                set aside for transport to ensure that programmes will be
                implemented?</p>

                Expenditure Limits (DEL). Is the Minister aware that the
                predicted growth forecast for DEL in Northern Ireland over the
                next three years, in cash terms, is 3·6%, while the figure for
                the United Kingdom is 5·9%? Would the Minister allay our fears
                that the decision on public spending has less to do with the
                Barnett formula and more to do with a realistic understanding of
                the public expenditure needs of Northern Ireland?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note in your statement the extra £74
                million for community care, but as one who has a professional
                background in that area I must say that it is somewhat
                inadequate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But it particularly concerns me that yet
                again the Government are demanding 3% efficiency savings from
                health and personal social services. Does the Minister seriously
                believe that after a decade of such cuts there is any more fat
                left in the system, or does he agree with me that we are now
                cutting back into the core services?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister confirm whether it is
                planned to cut back on recruitment to the Royal Ulster
                Constabulary Reserve? Is it this Government’s policy to shelve
                recruitment to a body which has served this country faithfully
                for the past 28 years?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Murphy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Sammy&nbsp;Wilson asked a number of
                useful questions about water and sewerage and expressed his
                dismay. Indeed, I have also been expressive in my own area over
                the last few weeks about the appalling effect that flooding can
                have on people’s lives. It can be a devastating experience,
                and I understand the significance of the points he has made. In
                fact, the budget provides for a significant amount of money to
                deal with flooding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member also raised questions about urban
                regeneration and transport — in particular, parking provision.
                Transport is, of course, a matter for Lord&nbsp;Dubs, and I will
                make sure that he receives the point made by the Member. He will
                provide the Member with a written response.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Urban Regeneration Programme has been
                mentioned by a number of Members, and I can tell them that the
                Government are planning to spend about £120 million between
                1999 and 2002. There are resources for Making Belfast Work, the
                Londonderry Regeneration Initiative and joint projects with the
                International Fund for Ireland. Further resources will be
                available from the International Fund and from European Union
                programmes such as the Special Programme for Peace and
                Reconciliation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have not finally allocated those
                resources, but we believe that they will be sufficient to
                deliver a substantial programme of regeneration measured
                throughout the region.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Odyssey is not being offset directly, but in
                setting forward plans we cannot, of course, ignore other events.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That was one of the reasons for our visit
                last week — to press home with the European Union, and
                particularly with the Commissioners, the need to ensure that our
                most difficult and deprived areas are funded properly not just
                by the United Kingdom Government, but by the European Union as
                well. The European Union has been good to us over the years, and
                I hope that our visit will ensure a continuation of good
                funding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;M&nbsp;Murphy raised the question of
                water and, particularly, the lack of provision in rural areas. I
                agree with his points, and that is why we are proposing such a
                large capital increase in the spending on water and sewerage
                services. I would not have thought that there was a need now for
                an extra fund, but if the Assembly feels, when it debates these
                issues — and it will do so in the near future when proposals
                are put to it — that an extra fund is worth examining, I
                certainly would not dismiss it and neither, I am sure, would
                Lord Dubs. Ultimately, however, it will be a matter for the
                Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr K Robinson very kindly referred to our
                visit in Brussels last week. I think I needed a little looking
                after myself by the time we arrived back at our hotel on the
                Thursday. We had a busy few days, very exhausting, but very
                worthwhile. I think that all parties would agree that we
                certainly got the message across to the Commission and to Europe
                about how important it is that a link be established. The
                Assembly will eventually have a very important role itself in
                Brussels, ensuring that the points that were made earlier in the
                debate about urban regeneration, community and economic
                development are put directly to the people there.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to Springvale, I will reply to
                Mr&nbsp;Robinson in detail. I will say, however, that in April
                we announced an investment of £40 million towards the
                development of a unique further-and-higher education complex at
                Springvale, on the peace line between North Belfast and West
                Belfast, costing £70 million. Details of the split in spending
                will be contained in my reply.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Robinson also referred to various aspects
                of teacher training. We believe that substantial resources have
                already been allocated, and I will reply in some detail on that
                one as well.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McClelland referred to public spending and
                to the Barnett formula. In the next couple of years this will be
                a major issue that the United Kingdom Government have to face
                — not just because of Northern Ireland, but because of
                Scotland and Wales as well. The Assembly will have difficult
                negotiations with London to ensure that the Assembly grant meets
                the needs of the people in all aspects. I have no doubt that the
                Government have goodwill towards the Assembly; but it needs more
                than goodwill. It will mean hard bargaining and negotiations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford referred to the 3% efficiency savings
                in health and community care. I respect the fact that he has a
                background in this area, one that has been neglected over the
                years. Community care is a good concept, but it needs backup and
                resources. The money that passed last week from the Chancellor
                of the Exchequer allocated to community care will certainly be
                of great service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As to Mr Kane’s point about the RUC
                Reserve, I will make sure that my colleague, Mr&nbsp;Ingram, is
                so informed. Mr&nbsp;Kane will see that there is very
                satisfactory financing and budgeting for police services in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>

                targeting social need initiative and the one or more public
                appraisal and fair treatment categories? Does this mean that
                targeting social need is no longer a priority, and will the
                setting of the regional rate under devolution consider targeting
                social need areas as having special status in relation to
                raising the £22.5 million extra in 1999/2000?</p>

                A visitor from Mars attending this debate might be rather
                perplexed by the fact that we are trying to find £60 million
                for water services while in the agriculture budget we have to
                find £6 million to protect against flooding. I draw the
                Minister’s attention to the line on responding to pressures in
                animal health and food safety. When we farmers hear of more
                money being given to the Department for pressures in this area,
                we say &quot;Oh, no; this must mean more inspections.&quot; Is
                this money to be used to enforce more regulations or to help the
                farmer comply with regulations that are already in place?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the positive aspects of the budget
                for health and education. I am a teacher, and my poor,
                long-suffering wife is a nurse, so there is something of a
                vested interest in the matter. My concern, however, relates to
                housing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What has happened to the housing budget in
                Northern Ireland over the past 10 years under the Minister’s
                predecessors is nothing short of disgraceful. Year after year,
                stop/go economic policies have caused considerable difficulties
                for housing throughout Northern Ireland. Financial restraints
                meant that 150 Housing Executive jobs had to go — fortunately
                by voluntary redundancy — last year, the Housing Executive had
                to surrender its residual new-build role, and its grants and
                rehabilitation schemes had to be reduced. What will the effects
                of this relentless reduction in funding be for the Housing
                Executive, and will the Minister relent on these issues?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for his willingness to
                come to the Chamber to answer questions on this policy document.
                I also thank him for his role last week in the visit to
                Brussels. In relation to EU funding, to what extent are
                predicted levels of receipts and allocations from Europe taken
                into account in this review? At what level are the expected
                European receipts and allocations set in terms of Government
                thinking? This is particularly relevant to the continuing debate
                on Objective 1 status.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is useful to have this paper and
                presentation because they emphasise the amount which
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland receives in the block —£9&nbsp;billion
                for 1998-99, rising to £10 billion at the end of the financial
                period. That compares with £1 billion over five years from
                Europe. Therefore, in terms of money coming into Northern
                Ireland, while many people rightly and importantly focus on
                Europe, more attention needs to be given to money from the
                Exchequer. It is a far greater amount, and it is sometimes
                overlooked when talking about Europe.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I join in thanking the Minister for
                presenting the document and answering questions. I had an
                opportunity earlier and elsewhere to talk to the Minister about
                the comprehensive spending review. The Secretary of State
                outlined public expenditure priorities and referred to extensive
                consultations with the political parties, district councils, the
                business sector, trade unions, the voluntary and community
                sectors and others. I was disappointed by the reference to new
                TSN and PAFT. In the consultation, it will have been made clear
                to the Minister and his colleagues how much priority is attached
                to ring-fencing these measures. They are seen as essential for

                satisfactory response to what I can testify personally was a
                strongly felt argument that was presented directly to the
                Minister in the consultations. The disparities over many years
                on infrastructure developments such as roads, ports, airports
                and energy — the case has been made about the gas pipeline —
                are obvious cases in terms of new beginnings. Education is
                another. Some areas have twice the deprivation and unemployment
                of others. Those issues were raised directly, but where in this
                document is the Minister’s response or a sign that attention
                was paid to those issues? I certainly cannot find any such
                references.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Kennedy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the opportunity to ask questions on
                this important document, but I am concerned about the short
                notice. Many Members were away last week, and we have not had a
                proper opportunity to study this matter. We are getting answers,
                but I should like to see the deadline on this important document
                extended so that Members may have more time to consider this
                important document and make representations.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Murphy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Gildernew referred to TSN and PAFT and to
                how the regional rate might be used to promote those schemes. Mr
                McLaughlin also spoke about those issues. So far as housing is
                concerned, there may be a small effect on PAFT, but that will be
                more than outweighed by the positive impact on health, education
                and other programmes in the budget. We are committed to TSN. It
                is a priority theme for all public expenditure programmes and,
                although it is not a programme in itself, it applies to all
                programmes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I propose to write to Members who have spoken
                about TSN and to other Members on the points they have made.
                That will enable me to respond in more detail than time allows
                today. I understand the significance that Members attach to TSN.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Leslie rightly raised the problems of
                agriculture. His plea was not for more inspections, but for more
                direct help. I am informed that the improvements are designed to
                help to meet existing requirements but not new impositions. I
                shall write to the Member on some of those matters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Direct help to the farmer rather than
                bureaucracy is important. The aim should be to ensure proper
                help to address the farming difficulties that have been
                identified in the debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill referred to housing. Housing has
                been very badly hit over the last decade, not just in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland but throughout the United Kingdom
                generally. The move towards housing associations is a welcome
                one. They have done a lot of good work in Northern Ireland and
                are able to access funding well beyond what the Housing
                Executive has to deal with. A total of £600 million is to be
                made available for housing in each of the next three years, and
                in the Chancellor’s package of last May an additional
                £11&nbsp;million was made available for housing in the worst
                estates.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A number of receipts have also been
                incorporated into this budget, but ultimately, if the Assembly
                feels there is inadequate support for social housing in this
                comprehensive spending review, the ability is there, as the year
                develops, to change some of this spending.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds referred to how successful last week’s
                European trip was in terms of making the point to those who
                matter in Europe — the key players — that there is no
                division in this Assembly, on political grounds, as regards the
                need to put Northern Ireland’s case and to get the best
                possible deal. With regard to the question of receipts being
                taken into account, in respect of the existing structural funds
                for the year 1999-2000 they have been, but after 2000, we cannot
                be certain what help will be made available. That is why we went
                to Europe — to try to ensure that we get help in the future.
                This will occupy the minds of Assembly Members for the next year
                — how to get the best possible deal. They saw the difficulties
                that we face, but they also saw the great deal of goodwill that
                exists in Brussels — and this is obviously something that we
                need to harness.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I apologise to Mr&nbsp;Kennedy for the
                lateness of this reply, but I will make two points. I do not
                think that the Assembly has done badly, so far, in making its
                views known in very considerable detail on various aspects of
                the budget. We are making a careful note of everything that has
                been said, whether on agricultural, targeting social need or
                policing. We have already had a lengthy consultation period, and
                the views expressed do not differ very much from the points that
                have been made here today. Obviously there is now more detail
                — the flesh and the figures are there. You can rest assured
                that we will take the Assembly’s views into account,
                particularly in the controversial areas that have been mentioned
                today.</p>

                and job creation?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">May I draw his attention to the
                Secretary&nbsp;of&nbsp;State’s 14&nbsp;July&nbsp;1998
                statement on the issue of additional spending in Northern
                Ireland when she indicated that her priorities included
                modernising the transport infrastructure before the end of 2002
                and, by March 2002, securing a commitment from the Industrial
                Development Board’s client companies to create 23,000 jobs?
                Does the Minister share my concern that, in terms of road
                infrastructure in North Antrim, the Glarryford to Ballycastle
                junction has seen about 303&nbsp;road traffic accidents, causing
                21&nbsp;deaths and over 600&nbsp;people to be injured in the
                past 10 years?</p>

                the Minister aware of the Industrial Development Board’s audit
                report, which shows that the areas of Moyle, Ballymoney and
                Ballymena, which account for almost 6% of Northern Ireland’s
                total unemployed, have had no significant job promotion
                programme in the last 10 years? How does he react to that
                picture of economic and social neglect and, indeed, job
                discrimination?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Molloy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Chathaoirligh, I welcome the increase in
                spending on health and education and hope that this will be used
                to ensure the retention of small rural schools, such as Carland
                in my own area, which we have been lobbying for. I also urge
                that extra money be used to retain hospitals such as the South
                Tyrone and the Mid-Ulster.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Throughout the comprehensive spending review,
                it appears that the Chancellor’s initiative is substitute
                rather than additional expenditure. Can the Minister provide the
                Assembly with a detailed breakdown of the proportion of the
                Chancellor’s initiative that is additional?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs E Bell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have two questions about the review. First,
                the Minister’s report said — and I welcome this
                wholeheartedly — that there will be a further 6,300 pre-school
                places by 2001. Mention was also made of capital and maintenance
                for schools. I would like to ask about the additional support
                being made available for integrated education and Irish-medium
                schools. Can the Minister give an assurance that the three
                integrated schools — Strangford, Oakwood and Ulidia — that
                have satisfied the criteria will receive finance for
                administration support? In addition, there are the Irish-medium
                schools. There are Meánscoil Dhoire and eight primary schools
                from Derry to Maghera, Castlewellan and Downpatrick, whose needs
                must be considered too.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My other concern relates to the current
                levels of provision for public libraries. Anyone, especially
                from North Down, knows that the libraries need only what is
                mentioned in the review: new stock and new buildings. The
                library in North Down is a safety hazard. I seek the Minister’s
                assurance that there will be moneys for what is noted in the
                review as well as for refurbishment, restocking and generally
                improved facilities for the libraries.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Foster:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I too welcome the Minister to give Members a
                little insight into this very important document. It is evident
                that there is not a pot of gold that never empties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the input into the social services
                budget, although I am concerned about whether it is enough. It
                needs to be increased by 7% year on year, just to keep up with
                medical advances.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My main question relates to roads. In the
                south-west of the province the roads leading to County
                Fermanagh, especially the part of the A4 from the Ballygawley
                roundabout to Augher, are snake-like tracks, and there is no
                sign of anything being done about this. The A4, which leads to
                the province’s lakeland area, needs to be improved. Is there
                any proposal to upgrade it?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Furthermore, we need a throughpass in
                Enniskillen, which is a bustling town that is presently choked
                with traffic, especially at rush hour. Are funds available
                within the budget for such a scheme?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr O’Connor:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like my colleague Mr&nbsp;ONeill, I should
                also like to speak about housing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Page 16 of the review refers to the provision
                of housing by associations rather than by the
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland Housing Executive, and to the introduction
                of a common waiting list. What steps have the Government taken
                to ensure that the tenants of such associations are not
                discriminated against or disadvantaged over their rights to
                repair or to buy their own homes or to receive discounts on such
                purchases? During civil unrest in July some Housing Executive
                tenants in my constituency who were forced from their homes were
                rehoused by an association. The discounts that they had accrued
                from the Northern&nbsp;Ireland Housing Executive no longer apply
                because they were rehoused by an association.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note the continuing cuts with great
                concern. The Minister said that one of the benefits is that
                private finance can be attracted to the industry to supplement
                public resources. My concern is that the cuts are not intended
                to supplement public resources but eventually to replace them,
                thus doing away with the Northern&nbsp;Ireland Housing
                Executive. That is my main concern.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Murphy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McMenamin referred to Strabane. I think
                that everyone is aware of Strabane’s unemployment problem. It
                is important for industrialists to consider such peripheral
                places. Part of my own constituency is far from the M4. It is
                easy to get the companies to come to the part that is close to
                the M4, but difficult to encourage them to come to the top of
                the valleys. It is a problem for industrial development boards
                and economic development Ministers. The difficulty is that
                ultimately it is the company’s decision regardless of how many
                benefits are put before it. Every effort should be made to
                attract firms. Mr&nbsp;Paisley referred to North Antrim in that
                context. The infrastructure of places that are outside areas of
                greater prosperity should be developed. That is easier said than
                done, but I am sure that the Assembly will lend its mind to it.
                Adam&nbsp;Ingram, my colleague in the Department of Economic
                Development, is conscious of the need for that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Paisley spoke about transport
                infrastructure and about jobs outside Belfast. The Chancellor’s
                initiative provides for the Ballymena/Antrim Road but
                Mr&nbsp;Paisley referred to the Larne Road. I will certainly
                draw his comments to the attention of Lord&nbsp;Dubs. They were
                made to me when I visited Ballymena some months ago and talked
                to the council. I think it is important that jobs and roads are
                carefully looked at and positively discriminated for by the
                Assembly when it sets about its business, but it is for the
                Assembly to decide how to deal with that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Molloy welcomed the spend on health and
                education, and mentioned small rural schools. I agree that they
                often provide excellent education. He specifically referred to
                the Chancellor’s initiative, and I am advised that all of it
                is additional. If he wishes to write to me for further detail, I
                shall be happy to respond.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs&nbsp;Bell spoke about Irish-medium and
                integrated education. Those matters were raised in the Commons
                last week, and the school in Derry to which she refers was
                mentioned. I spoke about help which I think the European Union
                is giving in that direction. The importance of looking carefully
                at the means by which opportunities can be improved for people
                who want to go to those schools was also raised in the Commons.
                The Government are committed to such opportunity, and I will
                write in detail to the Member about the schools to which she
                referred.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree that in a civilised society provision
                for libraries is hugely significant. We will be sustaining the
                library service at current levels. Funding will be available to
                link libraries into the National Grid for Learning, another
                benefit of the New Opportunities Fund. This will provide
                training in information technology and communications technology
                and will allow for the digitalisation of library contents. The
                Government are also putting an additional £2·5 million into
                provision for school libraries. My colleague Mr&nbsp;McFall will
                provide written answers to some of the more detailed points.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Foster referred to the condition of
                roads in the south-western area generally. I acknowledge again
                that border areas of Northern Ireland rely very heavily on a
                good road network. This is currently the responsibility of
                Lord&nbsp;Dubs, and he is engaged in a review of the programme.
                This will include consultation with the Assembly. We should be
                aware, of course, that, in the not too distant future, the
                Assembly will have its own Minister for Roads, or Minister for
                the Environment, who will be able to raise these matters with
                you. My colleague, Lord&nbsp;Dubs, will, of course, consult any
                such future Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;O’Connor raised the issue of
                housing associations and expressed the fear that public funding
                for these associations would be replaced by private funding.
                There is no reason why we cannot use both public and private
                funding. The local council in my area of south Wales, for
                instance, has not built any houses for many years, but hundreds
                of houses have been built by housing associations. I have also
                noted his points about the right to buy, the right to repair and
                the waiting list, and I will ask Lord&nbsp;Dubs to respond to
                him in more detail on these matters.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to draw the Minister’s
                attention to the removal of border security posts. This is an
                unnecessary waste of public funds. It has cost countless
                thousands of pounds to construct these posts, and it is now
                costing a similar amount to dismantle them. Would it not be more
                cost-effective to leave them in place and re-direct these
                resources to rebuilding police stations which have been bombed,
                such as that in Ballygawley? The money could also be spent on a
                new courthouse for Dungannon. This was the subject of a public
                inquiry some years ago, but it now seems to have disappeared
                from the Government’s priority list.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to ask the Minister about the
                Capital Grants Scheme, mentioned at page 12 of his paper. Will
                there be no further funding for farm diversification under the
                European Union’s sub-programme for agriculture and rural
                development? I would also like to say that I think that an
                answer given earlier by the Minister was incorrect. The amount
                of money paid by farmers to the Livestock Marketing Commission
                when they bring their cattle to be slaughtered makes this
                process nearly self-financing.</p>

                Also, why does it take so long, under the over-30-months scheme,
                for farmers to receive payment for animals slaughtered?
                Sometimes, it takes up to eight weeks for farmers to receive

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Bradley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My colleagues, Mr&nbsp;ONeill and Mr&nbsp;O’Connor
                have already raised the question of housing, and I listened
                attentively to the Minister’s replies, but I must ask if he
                would recommend to the Assembly that the Housing Executive, in
                its present form, be retained.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hussey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The infrastructural deficiency in the west
                has already been highlighted, as has the failure of Industrial
                Development Board not just in the town of Strabane, but in the
                entire Strabane District Council area and west Tyrone in
                general. Those two facts are not unrelated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But the question I wish to ask is to do with
                the regional rate. Over the years, councils have been trying to
                lower their district rate, only to have their endeavours
                frustrated by the effect of the regional rate which increases
                the householders’ rates bill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A major factor that district councils have
                recently had to deal with has been the effect of the landfill
                tax. The purpose of this tax is to try to reduce the amount of
                waste being put into landfill. Would it not be more efficient to
                allow a much larger proportion of the amount of landfill tax to
                be recouped by district councils? This would help to keep their
                rates lower. They could utilise that money to provide proper
                landfill facilities&nbsp;— which can be very expensive — and
                by doing so, they would be fulfilling the purpose of the tax.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the opportunity to address the
                Minister on roads and transport. In spite of comments about
                Belfast Harbour, I, like every other Member, welcome the
                Chancellor’s package on the roads programme. The Assembly
                will, I hope, have responsibility for roads infrastructure,
                operation and maintenance, and it will be up to its Members to
                prioritise and identify the areas of greatest need, such as the
                southern part of my constituency, Newry and Armagh.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My question is about the proposal to release
                additional spending power to the Northern Ireland Transport
                Holding Company. What procedures are in place to monitor the
                performance of the Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company,
                given that additional funding is being made available to it? I
                am referring not just to its business viability or accounting
                regularity, but also to the reason for its existence — to
                provide a public-transport system that is a viable alternative
                to the private car.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am asking this question in the light of the
                reduction or withdrawal without notice of bus services,
                especially on the Newry-Belfast route — a primary link between
                Belfast and the south-east. In addition, there are large rural
                areas which have practically no service — certainly no viable
                alternative to private transport.</p>

                colleagues. I shall ensure that they reply in writing on such
                matters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Morrow spoke about security posts.
                Expenditure on those falls to other budgets, but I assure him
                that they will not have an impact on the budget of the Assembly
                next year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;McElduff referred to an increase in
                pre-school figures. If funds were available, the number of
                places for pre-school cohort would rise from 59% to 85%. He also
                raised the question of funding for the training of staff who
                come into contact with children. Sufficient funding is to be
                made available for childcare services. There will be
                £7&nbsp;million in the first year, £11&nbsp;million in the
                second and £12&nbsp;million in the third.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Savage spoke about the capital grants
                scheme and the sub-programme for agriculture and rural
                development. That was designed to improve competitiveness and to
                deal with other issues. The proposed cessation of that scheme
                reflects priorities in the agriculture budget. Grants totalling
                some £44·5&nbsp;million will have been paid to more than
                9,000&nbsp;farm businesses. The Member also mentioned the ban on
                certain meat sales. I should like to see the return of the
                T-bone steak, but it has to be safe for us to eat. The market is
                currently examining this matter. I shall ensure that
                Lord&nbsp;Dubs writes to him on the important issue of the delay
                in payments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Bradley spoke about the
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland Housing Executive. There are no plans to
                get rid of it, and it will remain in its present form until the
                Assembly chooses to change it. Ultimately, it is a matter for
                the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Hussey referred to landfill tax.
                That, of course, is a national policy and is outside the scope
                of the Assembly. If he or others wish to raise it, I will make
                sure that the Government is made aware of that, particularly in
                relation to the striking of the district rate and the regional
                rate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;McNamara mentioned roads and

                during the past week with images of the devastation caused by
                hurricane Mitch. The loss of life and damage caused in a few
                hours has been unimaginable, even by the standards of what this
                community has gone through in the last 30 years — and I do not
                seek to trivialise the suffering in our own community. In
                Nicaragua, which has a population less than that of Ireland,
                more than 10,000 people are dead, more than two million people
                are homeless and the infrastructure has been destroyed to the
                extent that aid agencies are saying that the country has been
                set back 30 years. And the numbers are still increasing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This year has been a terrible one for
                disasters. We had devastating floods in Bangladesh and China
                that caused the deaths of many thousands and made millions
                homeless. The victims are suffering from diseases caused by
                stagnant water, fungal infections, and diarrhoea.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The vital statistics of global poverty are
                mind-numbing: 1·3&nbsp;billion people survive on the equivalent
                of less than a dollar (60p per day); nearly one billion people
                are illiterate; more than one billion lack access to safe water;
                840 million go hungry or face food insecurity; nearly one third
                of the people in the least developed countries are not expected
                to survive to the age of 40.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The poet, John Donne, said: &quot;No man is
                an island&quot;. I want the Assembly to consider my proposals
                because we cannot isolate ourselves from or insulate ourselves
                against what is happening in the rest of the world.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I am asking the parties meeting to
                discuss Ministries and the allocation of portfolios to set up a
                Committee to deal specifically with the Third World and
                international development because the Good Friday Agreement does
                not deal with this subject. This Committee could have four main
                objectives for the allocation of local resources: to refocus aid
                on the eradication of poverty; to build partnerships with
                developing countries and the private sector in order to
                strengthen commitment to development targets; to strengthen
                public understanding and support for international development;
                and to help ensure that the full range of government policies
                affecting developing countries takes account of sustainable
                development objectives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, Northern Ireland owes a great debt
                of gratitude to the rest of the world which has done so much to
                help us begin to resolve our problems. I refer to the practical
                aid. To date, over £350 million have been provided by the
                United States, the European Union, Canada, Australia and New
                Zealand through the International Fund for Ireland (IFI) for use
                in Northern Ireland and the border counties. The IFI aid is in
                addition to the billions which have been transferred to us from
                the European Union under the structural funds. For us it is
                payback time. We should now take up the challenge of repaying
                the rest of the world.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the great scandals is the level of
                Third-World debt. The United Kingdom alone is owed £8 billion
                by Third-World countries. In Nicaragua, before the disaster
                struck, servicing that debt cost £1&nbsp;million per day in
                interest alone — one third of the value of its exports.
                Nicaragua has no chance of meeting its obligations. Some will
                say that Third-World countries, particularly those which were
                dictatorships, borrowed the money to buy armaments.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Countries like Nicaragua are fledgling
                democracies. We have a duty to help such countries and their
                people, who are often the poorest of the poor. Many things
                divide us in Northern Ireland, but in all communities there is a
                deep well of generosity towards those in other parts of the
                world who are less well off. Much of this generosity springs
                from religious motivation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Missionaries from Northern Ireland —
                Catholic, Presbyterian, Church of Ireland, Methodist, Baptist,
                and others — are to be found in every corner of the globe. The
                work of locally based agencies such as Oxfam, Trocaire,
                Concern&nbsp;International, Action&nbsp;Aid,
                Save&nbsp;the&nbsp;Children and Christian&nbsp;Aid is well-known
                and deeply appreciated. Northern Ireland is consistently found
                to be at or near the top of the league table of charitable
                giving among United Kingdom regions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Part of that deep well of humanitarianism and
                compassion is a result of our shared suffering. One hundred and
                fifty years ago Ireland experienced a famine which led to one
                million deaths and, over several generations, the emigration of
                three million people. Our economy has serious difficulties, but
                when prosperity returns we will have a moral duty to help those
                much less well off than ourselves.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been a world-wide phenomenon that
                societies become less generous as they grow more prosperous, and
                we will not be immune from that trend unless we adopt a clear
                and defined target to meet. The size of our aid budget is a
                litmus-test of our commitment to civil rights and civilised
                values. We should adopt a target because we have benefited
                greatly from the generosity of others. It is in our own interest
                to help stop the cutting down of rain forests, global warming
                and the waste of fossil fuels. We can afford to do it, and it is
                the right thing to do.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, as part of our Third-World
                development programme, we should have some provision for
                voluntary services overseas, particularly for young people or
                those with transferable skills. One of the most successful
                initiatives of the International Fund for Ireland (IFI) has been
                the wider horizons programme, which has taken young people from
                their local setting and sent them to other parts of the world
                where, at times, they have worked to help others less well off
                than themselves.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Programmes like the Duke of Edinburgh Award
                Scheme and Operation Raleigh have similar objectives. The
                results have been wholly beneficial in terms of personal growth
                and development and in fostering a wider perspective in the
                young people. It is also a useful corrective to the
                introspection and introversion which we are all prone to at
                times. In some cases it would be a local version of President
                Kennedy’s Peace Corps.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Beside me is a large plastic bucket. I am not
                normally in favour of sticking-plaster solutions to major
                problems. We should have an integrated, strategic approach along
                the lines I have indicated. However, I am taking contributions
                from Assembly Members, officials, visitors and, of course, the
                media. A clerical Member of the House is well-known for
                appealing for a silent collection from his congregation — bank
                notes only. I want to make the same appeal today, and I want to
                assure Members that every penny contributed will go to the joint
                appeals from Concern&nbsp;International, Oxfam,
                Save&nbsp;the&nbsp;Children, and Christian&nbsp;Aid. I want
                people to give until it hurts in a very immediate way.</p>

                political weapon against our culture? Unlike Irish, the
                Ulster-Scots language and cultural tradition are to be found in
                both communities and are acceptable to all.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Adamson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ulster-Scots is stigmatised and has no status
                or recognition. Native speakers — I have been one, although I
                am no longer a great speaker of Ulster-Scots — who complete
                second and third-level education abandon the language because of
                its low status. It receives no public funding, has no access to
                broadcasting or newspapers, and has no equivalent in the BBC to
                the Irish language or Gaelic in Scotland. It has no
                representatives on public bodies concerned with the arts,
                museums, cultural traditions or education.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For 400 years there has been no formal
                education in Scots or Ulster-Scots. The fact that the language
                has survived not simply as a spoken tongue but with its own
                literature is remarkable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All Ulster-Scots writers since the lowland
                Scots settlers of the early 1600s (who were all taught in
                Scots), and all writers contributing to the enormous corpus of
                Ulster-Scots literature were self-taught. They had only the
                benefit of earlier and contemporary writings. None were schooled
                in Scots — all in English.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is hardly surprising that Ulster-Scots
                literature has degenerated completely over the centuries. The
                vocabulary has been eroded at the expense of English in
                vernacular speech and in written works. The literary use of
                dialectal or individualistic pronunciation, spellings, or
                ignoring previously accepted standard Scots, is due partly to
                the erosion of the language and partly to ignorance about the
                Ulster-Scots literary tradition among Ulster-Scots themselves. I
                contend that that underlines the need for the establishment of
                an Ulster-Scots academy, and for a functional approach to
                language policy in association with the new Scottish Parliament,
                thus creating the new east/west link which would be of value to
                both.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The broad aim of the academy — taking
                Ulster-Scots out of a dark age of four centuries without any
                literary-based linguistic research — will involve the
                following: rediscovery of the Ulster-Scots literary tradition;
                encouragement of writing in Ulster-Scots and a renaissance of
                Ulster-Scots literacy; elevation of the linguistic study of
                Ulster-Scots to that of a living European language in its own
                right; and study of the grammar and syntax of the language. That
                is more or less what happened to Irish in the 1920s. Then, of
                course, there was no academic impetus to develop or sustain the
                Irish language, and Mr&nbsp;De&nbsp;Valera’s translation
                department — believe it or not — was asked to do the job.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The promotion of Ulster-Scots in Scotland, or
                indeed Irish, should not be about kick-starting the languages
                — especially Ulster-Scots — to bring them roaring back into
                life and racing down the highways of the world. To think of them
                in that way grossly overestimates what education can do.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, we can re-evaluate and teach aspects
                of Ulster-Scots which have been regularly ignored in the
                Northern Ireland curriculum. Such activities will promote a
                sense of identity by developing a deeper sense of the literature
                and culture of Ulster in all its forms.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should not seek to produce a course of
                education with the intention of supplanting or even reducing the
                significance of standard English. In fact, quite the contrary.
                If our main business is to develop an expanded awareness of the
                diversity of language in Northern Ireland, this will necessarily
                develop the knowledge of the absolute need for standard English
                as a working language. We should therefore provide more support
                for English as the common tongue of these British Isles.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Scottish Parliament will be a complex
                institution, centred, of course, on the shaping and enactment of
                legislation by its members, but undertaking a broad range of
                less prominent business as well. In assessing the ways in which
                Scotland’s languages might be used, it would be better to look
                at things the Parliament will do and the ways in which Gaelic
                (Gallic in Scots) might be used in specific contexts, rather
                than seek to devise a blanket policy, which would mean
                unachievable objectives or misallocated resources.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Resources will obviously be an important
                factor in shaping language policy, both here and in Scotland.
                Translation can be an expensive proposition for government in
                all its forms. It has been estimated, for example, that some 40%
                of the European Union’s administrative budget is for
                translation and interpreting services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue of value for money must always be
                borne in mind, but it must not be used as an excuse for an
                unduly restrictive approach. A policy that would ensure
                reasonable use of language in Parliament and in the Assembly, as
                opposed to a policy of total bilingualism or even trilingualism,
                would surely demand only a tiny share of the operating budgets.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I return to a letter that I wrote to Dr
                Mowlam on 22 April 1998 requesting an urgent meeting to discuss
                provision for Ulster-Scots. An acknowledgement was received from
                the Secretary of State’s Private Office stating that a reply
                would be forwarded as soon as possible. No reply was received.
                Four times I telephoned the Secretary of State’s Office. I was
                told they would get back, but there was no return call —

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proof positive of change for our
                community will be the experience of equality and parity of
                esteem. The reality of equality and parity of esteem means, for
                Unionists, the loss of their veto over political change and
                progress.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me paraphrase words of my Colleague and
                party leader, Mr Gerry Adams: &quot;They have not gone away, you
                know.&quot; We have not gone away. By &quot;we&quot; I mean the
                Nationalist population of this part of this island. We have been
                here for generations. Our parents, grandparents and
                great-grandparents lived in this part of Ireland. They were born
                and wed, went through life and were buried here. We are not
                going to go away.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By the same token, we do not want the members
                of the other community to go away. They too have been a part of
                this island for centuries. That is where we start from as
                Republicans, as Nationalists, in an attempt to work out a
                political framework within which we can be guaranteed equality
                of opportunity, the ability to strive for our political
                objectives, free from harassment and free from laws that would
                deny us our national identity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As was mentioned in an earlier debate, the
                British Government have just released a consultation paper on
                public expenditure for the North of Ireland for 1999–2002 —
                the result of the comprehensive spending review launched by the
                Labour Party in May 1997.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This has serious implications for the
                equality agenda in the Six Counties. The Belfast Agreement was
                important because it placed the equality issue at the very heart
                of current and future political developments in Ireland.
                Nationalists accepted the Agreement on that basis. Now the
                British Government appear to be running away from that
                commitment as quickly as they can. It appears from the
                consultation document on the review that provision for Targeting
                Social Need has lost its status as a third expenditure priority.
                Targeting Social Need as a third expenditure priority gave
                recognition, on paper at least, to the fact that, by all major
                indicators of social and economic disadvantage, the Catholic
                community generally experiences higher levels of disadvantage.
                This is stated in the Government Paper ‘Aspects of Britain’.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be quite wrong for me to deny the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr J Kelly:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I was saying, the Catholic community
                generally experiences higher levels of disadvantage. Even the
                Tories had a paper commitment to using Government expenditure in
                pursuit of equality. New Labour appears to have dropped that
                commitment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the CSR, the Government admit that there
                may be adverse consequences for the &quot;new and
                reinvigorated&quot; TSN and, in particular, &quot;one or more
                PAFT categories&quot;. Given that resources for TSN appear to be
                solely targeted within health, education, and the welfare to
                work programme, it appears that TSN is no longer a priority. The
                Government suggest that their support for Springvale is somehow
                an alternative to TSN. One has to ask what meaningful impact
                Springvale will have on Nationalists and other equality
                constituencies west of the Bann? As the threat of serious job
                losses hangs over the textile industry in Derry, there is a
                pressing need for a reinvigorated commitment to using Government
                expenditure to address the legacy of economic injustice and
                discrimination in the Six Counties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The CSR document targets health and education
                as high priorities for Government expenditure, rather than
                giving an expressed commitment to Targeting Social Need as a
                whole. Does this mean that the Government hope to reduce
                inequality by targeting these two areas? Do the Government hope
                that there will be some trickle-down effect on women,
                the&nbsp;disabled, Catholics, Nationalists and ethnic minorities
                by increasing spending on health and education? Targeting need
                requires focused spending with goals, timetables and evaluation
                — not some nebulous commitment to economic development. In any
                democratic society, the targeting of these areas should be the
                norm. We are here in Stormont — which for many Nationalists
                represents the very seat of &quot;the Protestant state for a
                Protestant people&quot; — a domain of white, middle- and
                upper-class Protestant men.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all need to get used to the idea that
                government in the North of Ireland now belongs to everybody.
                This institution, its government Departments and the policies
                developed should reflect this new reality. People need to accept
                not only that there are going to be Catholics about the place,
                but Nationalists and Republicans, disabled people, ethnic
                minorities, women and, dare I say it, lesbians and gays as well.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Equality is the key component in achieving
                &quot;peace, stability and prosperity&quot; in the North of
                Ireland, according to the Belfast Agreement. Yet in the
                consultation document on public expenditure, equality is not
                even mentioned as one of the key aims of the comprehensive
                spending review. The four supporting aims mentioned in the
                document must, as a necessity, be underpinned by a commitment to
                equality and by policies and legislation to promote equality of
                opportunity and outcome.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn&nbsp;Fein will continue to insist that
                equality is central to the whole process of government,
                including, crucially, decisions involving government
                expenditure. We will also continue to make government accessible
                to all the equality constituencies that, by discrimination, have
                been excluded from government in the past. To this end I will be
                hosting a consultative conference on equality at Stormont on
                30&nbsp;November. This is one way of getting government back to
                the people and making sure that Stormont and the rest of the
                apparatus of government is returned to the people of the Six
                Counties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Sinn&nbsp;Fein’s equality spokesperson
                in the Assembly, I will be hosting the conference. Involvement
                will extend to as wide a representation of equality
                constituencies as possible, and the conference will be open to
                anyone who wants to attend. There will be three key inputs.
                First, there will be input from key experts who will provide
                context setting and models of good practice. Speakers include
                Haroon&nbsp;Saad, the head of the Equal Opportunities Unit at
                Birmingham City Council. Second, there will be input from all
                the parties in the Assembly on their vision of how to progress
                the equality agenda, and third, there will be input from all the
                key equality constituencies — women, Nationalists, minority
                ethnic groups, disability groups, lesbian and gay groups, youth
                and older people’s groups, and so on.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to take this opportunity to
                bring before the House two issues concerning the future of Irish
                League football. When or if this Assembly ever gets around to
                dealing with the social affairs of the people of Northern
                Ireland, the Minister responsible for sport will find these
                matters sitting prominently on his desk.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first issue is health and safety. Since
                May 1993, local authorities have been the enforcing bodies for
                the health and safety legislation for sports grounds. However,
                the existing legislation is limited in Northern&nbsp;Ireland,
                and that means that only piecemeal improvements have been made.
                This is disappointing as soccer can still attract crowds to
                venues which do not lend themselves to effective crowd
                management.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Prior to 1990, safety problems experienced
                mostly at soccer grounds had been blighting sport in
                Great&nbsp;Britain for a number of years. Incidents such as the
                disasters at Ibrox, Bradford and Hillsborough had focused
                attention on the subject, specific legislation was enacted to
                improve safety. This legislation requires safety certificates to
                be issued by local authorities to ensure that clubs implement
                the recommendations contained in the Taylor Report.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr R Hutchinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Member agree with me that unless the
                tranche of money which is being held by the Secretary of State
                for Irish League Football grounds is used to help football teams
                in the premier division and in the first division that are faced
                with bills for health and safety, many of them will be put out
                of existence? That is sadly the case with Carrickfergus and with
                Larne, where I come from and where there has been a strong
                tradition of Irish League Football.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hilditch:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome my Colleague’s support.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Funding has been made available to help clubs
                in England, Wales and Scotland meet this safety standard.
                Generally this has resulted in a healthier viewing environment
                in sports grounds throughout Great Britain. Similar legislation,
                coupled with the appropriate funding, could now be introduced in
                Northern Ireland with appropriate control to ensure that it was
                properly applied.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the very large crowds which attend
                cross-channel events are not a feature of life in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland, the figures are still of sufficient size
                to initiate safety concerns. It is clear that persevering with
                the existing health and safety legislation will achieve little
                and that more direct controls are essential. Failure to
                introduce these controls places spectators at risk, imposes an
                unnecessary burden on enforcement officers, police and the
                emergency services and leaves Northern Ireland with a sporting
                environment in which there is the potential for a major incident
                at any time. Either Westminster or the Assembly must act before
                it is too late.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I have already said, the legislation
                specific to football-ground safety in Great Britain has not been
                enacted in Northern Ireland, and inspectors have resolved the
                problem using existing health and safety legislation.
                Inspections have been carried out at a number of venues, and
                these have revealed a number of structural problems, while
                interviews with clubs and the governing body and liaison with
                police and emergency services have indicated that serious safety
                management problems exist.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To date, local authorities have had
                difficulties in achieving significant improvements owing to the
                absence of specific legislation and, especially, funding. One
                has only to look at Coleraine Football Club, as an example,
                where £250,000 must be found to implement the recommendations.
                It is impossible for any club to meet and absorb these costs in
                an already back-to-the-wall financial climate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the positive side, an inter-departmental
                committee was set up comprising representatives from the local
                authority environmental health departments, the Department of
                Education for Northern&nbsp;Ireland, the Department of the
                Environment, the Health and Safety Agency, the RUC and the
                Sports Council for Northern&nbsp;Ireland. It met regularly to
                discuss progress, and a working party was set up in 1992 to
                review controls over safety in grounds in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is understood that a final report has been
                prepared which is currently with the Department of Education.
                However, despite the support of successive Conservative and
                Labour Governments, the latest word is that it is now the
                intention to leave this matter to the Assembly in the hope that
                a slot can be found to include this extremely urgent and very
                important piece of legislation in our programme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It should be noted that the required funding
                will be between £20 million and £25 million on a phased basis.
                Let us hope that we do not have a major disaster at any of our
                grounds while we await the legislation and funding becoming
                available! Our senior clubs’ grounds compare very favourably
                with those in the lower divisions in England’s football league
                and even more so with clubs from the second and third divisions
                of the Scottish League, each of whom has obtained substantial
                financial assistance to upgrade those grounds and, in some
                cases, to build new stadiums with a 75% grant.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As part of the present Government’s
                commitment to assisting all recognised soccer leagues in the
                United Kingdom to meet acceptable standards, I demand that
                proper recognition and assistance be given to the
                administrators, management, players and supporters of the Irish
                League who have kept football alive for 30&nbsp;years during our
                darkest days.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the same vein, the aforementioned people
                deserve clarification on another issue, the much hyped and
                publicised alleged relocation of Wimbledon Football Club to
                Belfast and the establishment of Belfast United. First, I ask
                Wimbledon Football Club to state publicly if it is its intention
                to relocate to Belfast. If it should confirm or deny the name
                change to Belfast United, I would then ask whether it is its
                intention, if it relocates, to pay the six-figure sum package
                similar to that offered to Dublin clubs some time ago.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, I call upon the Government to
                clarify whether they intend to release land, at a cost of
                approximately £2&nbsp;million to the taxpayer, to a private
                business consortium. If this figure is the Government’s
                commitment, who then will build a stadium at an approximate cost
                of £55&nbsp;million, considering its limited use, with other
                existing long-term leases at other venues?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, and lastly, we need to know if the
                English FA Premiership and UEFA are both prepared to break or
                amend their rules to allow a club of such stature to be based in
                Northern Ireland. Clarification on these points is urgently
                required to allow the Irish League to map its own future,
                otherwise it is back to pie in the sky. The public and the
                administrators of our local game have the right to know what is
                going on behind the current media headlines, which are creating
                the uncertainty. Members can obtain more information from their
                local clubs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At some stage in the future, the Assembly
                will be making some important decisions on the future of Irish
                League football.</p>

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thank you, Mr Initial Presiding Officer, for
                the opportunity to raise a matter of intense aggravation to the
                people of my constituency. This is a seasonal problem that
                almost exclusively affects people in Newry and Armagh,
                particularly South Armagh. I say &quot;almost exclusively&quot;,
                because I understand that there was quite extensive loss of
                power in County Down last night and, indeed, today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My sympathy goes to those people who have
                suffered a terrible intrusion to their life and homes when they
                experienced a loss of power. However, it was an occasional
                experience for those people in County Down, yesterday and today.
                For the last six or seven years there have been extensive power
                failures in Newry, Armagh and the South Armagh region in the
                weeks running up to Christmas. In each of the last five years
                there have been prolonged blackouts on Christmas Eve, Christmas
                Day and continuously through to New Year’s Day in some or all
                parts of Newry and Armagh.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly has a timely opportunity today
                to hear of some of the problems that this situation has created.
                At some point in the future, it may fall to the Assembly to take
                action to challenge the monopoly position that NIE enjoys, to
                challenge their performance record, and to stand up for
                electricity consumers so severely disadvantaged by the
                contractual arrangements that allow NIE to make extortionate
                profits. These arrangements allow NIE to charge the highest
                electricity prices in Great Britain or Ireland and to engage in
                blatant profiteering.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is timely also because, just as winter is
                drawing in again, the first major power failure of the season
                occurred in South Armagh on Tuesday 20&nbsp;October 1998. The
                entire region from the Fathom Line at Newry to the border at
                Cullaville was without electricity for a number of hours.
                Obviously, the second major failure happened in County Down last
                night and this morning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If this is the portent of things to come for
                this Christmas, there will be hell to pay. I assure Members
                that, as a representative of the Newry and Armagh constituency,
                I will ensure that the buck stops where it should: with the
                board of NIE.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No one should have any doubt that the
                substantial loss of power creates profound problems,
                particularly for people in isolated rural areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It creates obvious problems for the elderly
                and infirm who cannot heat their homes or cook meals, have no
                alternative light and may, in some cases, be completely isolated
                in their homes. It is a frightening, threatening, unsettling
                experience for many and indeed life-threatening for some. It
                creates many obvious problems for couples and families with
                young children who need bottles warmed by day and night and a
                continuous supply of clean clothes and nappies. These things
                simply cannot be done if there is a prolonged power cut.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are less obvious problems. Road safety
                is compromised if street lighting is knocked out. Food in
                fridges and freezers begins to defrost, affecting every home,
                every grocery store and every corner shop. Any electric
                appliance operated by a timer is, inevitably, affected —
                computers, video recorders, central heating systems, burglar
                alarm systems, hands-free phone sets and so on. It can be an
                expensive business with no statutory entitlement to compensation
                for losses.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nobody will grumble too much if this is an
                occasional problem, like the County Down problem, caused by
                exceptional storm conditions or snow fall. The situation in
                Newry and Armagh, however, does not fall into that category. For
                seven consecutive winters there have been prolonged and
                repetitive power failures at the same time of year and in the
                same locations. No amount of meetings, letters or petitions has
                so far elicited a guarantee of secure power supply in my
                constituency. That is not to say that nothing has been done.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1993 the then Minister, Mr Atkins
                confirmed that £195,000 would be invested in the distribution
                network around the Camlough area. We were led to believe that
                this would resolve the problem — it did not. We were told that
                part of the network was obsolete and needed replacement. We were
                told, in some cases, that vandals were to blame for the failure
                of the supply. We were told, in other cases, that bad weather
                had caused the blackouts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All sorts of solutions were proposed by
                various Ministers and officials — Mr&nbsp;Atkins in 1993,
                Michael&nbsp;Ancram in 1995, Malcolm&nbsp;Moss in 1996, and
                Baroness&nbsp;Denton at the beginning of last year. We were told
                that a new 33&nbsp;kV line serving a new station at Newry would
                solve the problem — it has not. We were told that the
                refurbishment of the 11&nbsp;kV line towards Jonesborough would
                solve the problem. It has not. We were told that the
                strengthening of the sub-station at Silverbridge, with larger
                transformers and a new switchboard, would solve the problem. It
                has not. We were told that the refurbishment and upgrading of
                the lines in the Crossmaglen area would solve the problem. It
                has not. We were also told that the creation of a new 33&nbsp;kV
                circuit in the Slieve&nbsp;Gullion region would solve the
                problem. To date it has not.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not ungrateful for these efforts and for
                the investment. I am, however, disturbed because although most
                of this work was completed by last Christmas, it did not prevent
                the complete loss of power in the Jerrettspass area between
                Christmas&nbsp;Eve and December&nbsp;27. For four solid days,
                over a holiday period, people could not cook or heat or light
                their homes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I worry because even though all this work has
                now been completed, yet again we have had two major supply
                failures in the last three weeks. The dreadful pattern of winter
                power losses appears to be with us still, in spite of all the
                apparent strengthening of the system. I have asked myself what
                is the cause of this problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is it the case that there is a pattern of
                peculiarly inclement weather in my home area which sets it apart
                from the rest of Northern Ireland, creating unique problems for
                the maintenance of a secure power distribution system? If that
                is true, how can so many people in that part of Newry and Armagh
                look out of their windows at night — as I can — and see the
                lights of Dundalk, Louth and Monaghan shining brightly in all
                weather?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is it the case that the equipment continues
                to be so defective that it simply cannot cope with normal
                demands? That would be extraordinary given the litany of
                improvements that we have been told have been carried out. It
                would be insulting to people who live in an area through which
                the North/South electricity connectors stride across the
                landscape with scores of enormous, ugly pylons carrying their
                load of electricity for export to the Republic of Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The real answer to this wholly unacceptable
                situation can only be surmised by piecing together a number of
                replies to enquiries by the local MP, councillors and the
                district councils. In a letter to Newry and Mourne District
                Council the local manager of NIE referred to a huge increase in
                demand at Christmas. Subsequently, in a ministerial reply, it
                was confirmed that the annual growth of demand in Armagh city
                was precisely 2·5%, and in Newry and South&nbsp;Armagh 2·7%.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given such modest increases in the overall
                demand for power, and taking into account the fact that there
                are no massive consumers of electricity in the Newry and Armagh
                area — no large industries, not many hotels, restaurants or
                discos, and only one acute hospital — I am at a loss to know
                where this huge demand is coming from. Only a truthful answer
                from Northern Ireland Electricity will allow us to see the truly
                pernicious nature of this problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, there is a huge increase in demand
                during the winter, particularly at Christmas, caused by the
                weather and by people staying at home over the holiday period.
                But the huge increase in demand is not in the hills of south
                Armagh; it is in large urban areas, such as Greater Belfast,
                Derry and Craigavon. The power supply to those areas has been
                secured for seven or eight years now by the deliberate
                &quot;tripping out&quot; of supply in rural areas. This is
                unfair, unjust, inequitable and possibly illegal. In any case,
                it is unacceptable, and it must stop.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad to have had the opportunity to
                raise this matter, a running sore for my community, and the
                House will hear more of it if families are left once again with
                cold turkey on Christmas Day, if Christmas trees have no lights
                and if elderly people are left without heat.</p>
