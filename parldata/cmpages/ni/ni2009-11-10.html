      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 10.30 am (Mr Speaker in the  Chair).</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="1"></a>Executive Committee Business</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading">Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) Bill</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading">Consideration Stage</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Members will have a copy of the Marshalled List of amendments detailing the  order for consideration. The amendments have been grouped for debate in my  provisional grouping of amendments selected list.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There are three groups of amendments and a debate on  opposition to clause 50 stand part and schedule 4&rsquo;s being agreed. I have also  received notice from the Minister and some Members that they wish to speak to  clause 6.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We will debate the amendments in each group in turn. The  first debate will be on amendment Nos 1, 2, 8, 9 and 10 and opposition to  schedule 1&rsquo;s being agreed, which deal with matters relating to the definition  of &ldquo;goods vehicles&rdquo;. The second debate will be on amendment Nos 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,  12, 13 and 14, which deal with technical matters. The third debate will be on  amendment No 11, which deals with a new power for payment of grants.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I remind Members who intend to speak that during the  debates they should address all the amendments in each particular group on  which they wish to comment. Once the initial debate on each group is completed,  any subsequent amendments in the group will be moved formally as we go through  the Bill, and the Question on each will be put without further debate.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Questions on clause stand part and schedule&rsquo;s being  agreed will be taken at the appropriate points in the Bill. If that is clear,  we shall proceed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextClause">Clause 1 (Operators&rsquo; licences)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  We come to the first group of amendments for debate. With amendment No 1, it  will be convenient to debate amendment Nos 2, 8, 9 and 10, along with the  associated schedule 1, which the Minister has given notice that he wishes to  oppose. Those amendments deal with matters relating to the definition of &ldquo;goods  vehicles&rdquo;. Amendment No 1 is a paving amendment for amendment No 2. I call the  Minister of the Environment, Mr Edwin Poots, to move amendment No 1 and address  the other amendments in the group.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment (Mr Poots)</strong>: I beg to move amendment No 1: In page 1, line  10, leave out</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;within the meaning given in Schedule 1&rdquo;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The following amendments stood on the Marshalled  List:</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">No 2: In page 1, line 16, at end insert</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;(2A) For the purposes of subsection (2)(a) a goods  vehicle is a small goods vehicle if&mdash;</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it does  not form part of a vehicle combination and&mdash;</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it has  a relevant plated weight not exceeding 3.5 tonnes, or</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the  case of a vehicle which does not have a relevant plated weight, it has an  unladen weight not exceeding 1525 kilograms; or</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it forms  part of a vehicle combination and complies with such conditions as may be  prescribed;</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">and &lsquo;relevant plated weight&rsquo; in paragraph (a) means a  plated weight of the description specified in relation to that paragraph by  regulations.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[The Minister of the Environment (Mr Poots).]</span></span></p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">No 8: In clause 38, page 29, line 11, leave out paragraph  (c). <span style="font-size:8.5pt; ">&mdash; <span class="Italic">[The Minister of the  Environment (Mr Poots).]</span></span></p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">No 9: In clause 39, page 30, line 10, leave out</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;or paragraph 4(1) of Schedule 4&rdquo;. &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[The  Minister of the Environment (Mr Poots).]</span></span></p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">No 10: In clause 39, page 30, line 16, leave out</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;or paragraph 4(1) of Schedule 4&rdquo;. &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[The  Minister of the Environment (Mr Poots).]</span></span></p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The amendments in this group or, indeed, any of the  amendments to be debated at this stage do not involve any change of policy.  Rather, as I see it and, I believe, as the Committee for the Environment sees  it, they are designed to make what is a good Bill a little better.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The first group of amendments relates to the definition of  a &ldquo;small goods vehicle&rdquo; in clause 1 and schedule 1 and the requirement for  large goods vehicles to carry consignment notes in clauses 38, 39, 50 and  schedule 4. As drafted, the definition of a small goods vehicle replicates the  definition in the Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) Act 1995 in Great Britain.  However, the definition is complex and has resulted in confusion as to what  vehicles are deemed to fall within the scope of operator licensing. That is  particularly the case in relation to vehicle combinations. I want to simplify  the definition, and I want people to know whether their vehicle is in scope or  out of scope. The proper way to do that is through regulations, rather than in  the Bill.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 1 will remove a reference to schedule 1, which  contains the definition. The impact will be that the requirement to hold an  operator&rsquo;s licence will not apply to the use of small goods vehicles generally.  Amendment No 2 will insert a new subsection (2A) into clause 1 to provide the  power to make regulations that will describe vehicle combinations in a simple  manner. Schedule 1 will not, therefore, be needed, and I intend to oppose the  Question that schedule 1 be agreed to. These amendments will allow the  definition of small goods vehicles to be clear and unambiguous. Officials will,  at an early stage, present for my approval and that of the Environment  Committee proposals on exemptions and in- and out-of-scope vehicles.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The remaining amendments in the group will remove the  references to schedule 4 to the Bill from clauses 38 and 39. I intend to oppose  the Questions that schedule 4 be agreed to and that clause 50, which refers to  it, stand part of the Bill. Amendment Nos 8, 9 and 10 are consequential to the  proposed removal of schedule 4 and remove references to it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I understand that all of the group one amendments have been  explained in some detail to the Committee by my officials and that consensus  has been reached in tabling them. I thank the Committee for its patience in its  detailed scrutiny of the Bill and these amendments, as well as the other  amendments, which we will deal with later.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for the Environment (Mr Boylan)</strong>: Go raibh  maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I pay tribute to the departmental officials,  the Bill Office and the Committee staff and thank them for their assistance in  bringing forward the Bill.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">On behalf of the Committee for the Environment, I welcome  the Consideration Stage of this important Bill, which is needed to deal with  all matters relating to the regulation of road freight operators. The Committee  recognises that the Bill has the potential to enhance road safety, improve the  image of the freight sector and contribute to the fight against organised  crime. It has been a long time coming, and I will take the opportunity to say a  few words on the key recommendations that have been made during the Bill&rsquo;s  Committee Stage.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill was referred to the Committee on 21 May 2008, and  members conducted detailed scrutiny in which they made recommendations and  prompted amendments, where the Committee deemed necessary. The good working  relationship that was established between the Committee and departmental  officials paid dividends when it came to agreeing those recommendations.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee made three recommendations that very much  relate to the Bill, although they are not directly linked to it. One  recommendation relates to planning, and I will come back to that later when we  debate the relevant clause. The other two recommendations are concerned with  enforcement.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee discussed effective enforcement of the Bill  at length. On the basis of information that many stakeholders gave, the  Committee recommends that, in implementing the Bill, enforcement should be  delivered separately from the regulation. That happens in England, Scotland  and Wales  through the appointment of traffic commissioners, who, among their other  functions, operate independently to enforce goods vehicle licensing  legislation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">None of the members who where present when the commissioner  for the North Western Traffic Area in England attended the Committee are  likely to forget her evidence, and I pay tribute to Mr Trevor Clarke in  relation to that. However, her evidence, along with the support of many  stakeholders, persuaded the Committee that the feasibility of the appointment  of a traffic commissioner should be looked at more closely. Therefore, the  Committee recommends that the Department pursue the feasibility of the  appointment of a traffic commissioner who would have statutory responsibility  for, among other things, the licensing of goods vehicles here.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I believe firmly that the discussions in Committee between  members and departmental officials had the outcome of producing better  legislation. All the benefits that should come from the legislation will be  enhanced if the Minister takes on board the Committee&rsquo;s recommendations for  better enforcement.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I now turn to the first group of amendments. The Minister  outlined carefully the nature and purpose of these amendments, and I will give  the Committee&rsquo;s position on them. As we heard, amendment Nos 1 and 2 to clause  1 and the removal of schedule 1 aim to make the definition of small goods  vehicles clearer and to create less ambiguity about what will be in and out of  the scope of operator licensing. The Committee recognised that as a crucial  part of the Bill, and it questioned the Department at length on which vehicles  would be affected by the Bill and the principles on which exemptions would be  decided.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Having heard evidence from the Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union and the Horticultural Trades Association, the  Committee was particularly concerned about the potential impact of the Bill on  the farming sector. It also queried the impact that it would have on emergency  services and government vehicles. Therefore, the Committee welcomes these  amendments, which will clarify the meaning of small goods vehicles, and it  thanks the Minister for taking its concerns into consideration.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The other amendments in the group are consequential, and I  will refer to the Committee&rsquo;s position at a more relevant time, suffice it to  say at this point that the Committee agreed to and welcomes amendment Nos 8, 9  and 10 as proposed by the Department.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Before I call Mr Weir to speak, on behalf of the Assembly, I extend my warmest  welcome to our guests from America.  A senior delegation of Congressmen and Congresswomen are visiting Northern Ireland.  I know that I speak for the whole House in welcoming you to Parliament  Buildings this morning. I wish you well, and I thank you for coming.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  am sure that our visitors from America  will be delighted to see this great moment of democracy in action. I am sure  that Congress discusses little other than the Goods Vehicles (Licensing of  Operators) Bill, particularly its Consideration Stage and the definition of a  small goods vehicle.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">With that spirit of friendship across the water in mind, I  welcome this group of amendments. As a member of the Committee for the  Environment, I attended meetings during the Bill&rsquo;s Committee Stage. The  Committee was conscious of the need to ensure that the legislation was right  and that the proper balance was struck. The Minister and the Department have  acknowledged that the amendments are not the whole picture, and that is an  important point. To try to ensure that everything in the legislation is right,  the consequential regulations to be put in place will also be significant.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As indicated by the Deputy Chairperson of the Committee,  when we scrutinised the Bill in detail, certain areas were of concern to us.  Although the amendments will deal with a certain number of those, regulations  may be the most appropriate way to deal with some of the issues.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In striking a balance, it is important to ensure that the  amendments do not affect the main purpose of the Bill. Although some concerns  were raised about the Bill, and that led consequently to the amendments, the  Bill, as a whole, has a very useful purpose, as the Minister outlined. It deals  with a range of issues. It is important that we ensure &mdash; I think that it is the  case &mdash; that the amendments do not impinge on the central thrust of the Bill,  whether in relation to road safety or to ensuring that people are on a level  playing field when it comes to the transport of goods.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The vast majority of users of goods vehicles are reputable  and operate in a fashion that meets the safety requirements that exist already.  The regulations would be put in place to protect those users and those who are  involved in freight transport as much as possible. We have an unfortunate  problem in Northern Ireland  in that, because of the lack of regulation in the past, our reputation  throughout Europe has not been as good on that  issue as perhaps it should be. That creates problems for many of our drivers  who are fulfilling all the criteria when they go across the water. The Bill is  as much about protection of the industry and those who are involved at the  front line as it is about regulation. That is why the legislation is welcomed  by most of the relevant bodies.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am glad to see amendments and to see that they do not  impinge on but actually protect the central aspects of the Bill. However, the  other aspect is that, although that protection and regulation is needed, as was  indicated by the farming community and those who are involved in light  transport, it is important that the regulations are not unnecessarily onerous  on the single operator or on people who are simply moving about, for example,  food products or goods relating to the farming industry. The amendments  consider the scope of operating licences &mdash; the bulk of that will come through  regulations &mdash; the issue of consignment notes and the definition of a small  goods vehicle.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The amendments are an attempt by the Department to meet the  concerns that were raised by the Committee and to ensure that what is put in  place is fair across the system, so that people can have a level playing field,  and does not place a particularly onerous burden on the sector, particularly  those who use small goods vehicles. Other issues have been touched on: for  example, operator centres. I think that that issue is best dealt with by way of  the regulations. Committee members will be looking for provisions on that in  the regulations to ensure that we have a level playing field.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The amendments in group 1 provide a degree of balance  between ensuring that there is regulation to achieve the aims of the  legislation and ensuring that the burden is not onerous. I am, therefore, happy  to support the amendments.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  am content with the Bill and the amendments. The evidence that we received at  the Committee, particularly from the traffic commissioner for the north-western  area, ensured my support for moving forward in this area. We have to improve  the standard of the vehicles on our roads to improve road safety and the  protection of all our road users, including pedestrians who might get caught up  in accidents. The owner-account section has, to date, been exempted from this  type of scrutiny, and there has, therefore, been a danger of substandard  vehicles on our roads; some operators may have been undercutting others who  operate to a higher standard.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is a considerable move forward; it is long overdue  and will bring Northern Ireland  into line with other parts of the United Kingdom. The operators will  have additional costs, but they will also make savings by carrying out  preventative maintenance rather than reacting when their vehicles reach a  critical stage. The Bill will bring the considerable benefit of increased road  safety.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee heard evidence that criminals are using heavy  goods vehicles to move goods about and that that has caused difficulties for  the police. The new regulation will provide an ability to prevent those who  abuse the system by using those vehicles from being allowed to operate them and  will lessen that aspect of organised crime.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I also appreciate the manner in which the depart&shy;mental  officials and the Minister, who has acceded to the amendments, have shown  flexibility, particularly by using affirmative secondary regulations to  finalise exemptions. That will bring about improve&shy;ments and the flexibility to  allow the Department to react. If we do not get the legislation exactly right,  we will be able to listen, and, if adjustments are needed, they can be made  easily in the future.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am content with the Bill and the amendments. Support has  come from most people in the industry, including the Freight Transport  Association and the Road Haulage Association, to improve standards and make  operators more professional and better regulated. The Bill will allow the  authorities to concentrate on those who are not ensuring that their vehicles  are maintained to the highest standard.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  express my general support for the principles of the Bill and for the  amendments. A few months ago, we reached the Consideration Stage of the Taxis  Bill, and I remember saying that it was like the penultimate meeting of a  rather sad club that had met on many occasions. However, the membership of the  club has changed somewhat. In particular, there is a new Minister, who was not  subject to all the difficulties that some of us went through. Indeed, time took  its toll on the Committee; some of its members did not have the excitement of  going through the process. It is good to see that the same smiling faces are  sitting in the Minister&rsquo;s Official Box, watching as we debate the penultimate  stage of the Bill.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Does the Member agree that, perhaps, we were fortunate that there was a change  of Minister? The information that came back to the Committee was that the  previous Minister was minded not to proceed with the Bill. Is that correct?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  am not sure whether the Member wants me to join in praising one member of the  Democratic Unionist Party or in attacking another. I agree that there seems to  have been some delay in reaching this stage, but, under the current Minister,  we have at least reached it. I am glad that the current Minister listened to  the Committee, and, in particular, that the Committee was able to agree certain  issues with his officials as we examined the detail of the Bill. As the Deputy  Chairperson said, some of us have worked on the Bill since May 2008. Perhaps  the Committee did not have as many sessions on this Bill as we had on the Taxis  Bill, but, at times, it began to seem like it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A number of improvements has been made, which the  amendments recognise. I endorse those, particularly the fact that we have dealt  with the definition of a small goods vehicle in a way that reduces the  potential for over-onerous burdens on one-man or two-man businesses. Farmers,  the horticulture industry and representatives of small tradesmen who use a  single vehicle for themselves made that complaint about the original proposals.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have a slight concern, and the Minister should consider  whether there may be some difficulty over the issue of what could be described  as large fleets of small vehicles. We have addressed the legitimate concerns of  small operators about the size of a vehicle and the size of a business, but a  slight difficulty may have been created on that issue. I will be interested to  hear the Minister address that point in his summing-up remarks.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee has dealt with a variety of matters that did  not occur when similar legislation was introduced across the water, such as the  danger that rogue cross-border operators will cut into the business of  legitimate operators in Northern    Ireland. I certainly hope that we will see &mdash;  it does not currently seem to be the case &mdash; appropriate legislation being  passed in the Oireachtas to ensure that operators in Northern Ireland get fair  treatment on an all-Ireland basis.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As Peter Weir said, with the eloquence that we expect from  someone in his profession, the regulations that we will have to face will,  ultimately, be as significant as the Bill itself. We look forward to seeing the  Department produce those regulations as quickly as possible, because there is a  serious need to deal with the road safety problems being caused by a small  number of rogue operators, the people who create difficulties as they proceed  to GB or the continent.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is not too many months since I was driving along a  motorway in Wales and saw  that a vehicle with a Northern    Ireland registration had been pulled in for  a check by traffic police. That shows the unfortunate reputation that a  minority of bad operators have given the great majority of legitimate Northern Ireland  goods vehicle operators. The Assembly must ensure that legislation is passed to  defend the reputations of good operators who abide by regulations and deserve  to be supported.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Some colleagues have mentioned the evidence that was given  by the traffic commissioner for north-west England. I regret that it has not  been possible to include provision for an independent traffic commissioner in  the Bill. However, the Department must keep the matter under review and may  well need to address it in the near future.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">At present, the Bill and its proposed amendments represent  a significant step forward. I support them fully.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  Some Members may wonder why I am speaking in the debate as I am no longer a  member of the Environment Committee. I am speaking because I oppose the Bill  and, therefore, do not want to disappoint officials by not speaking in the  debate. I like my message to be consistent.</p>
      <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Although I welcome some of the Minister&rsquo;s changes to the  Bill, I am still disappointed with certain provisions. Indeed, there are a few  on which I seek clarification. I prefer that small operators with 3&middot;5-ton  vehicles be exempt from this particular process and that it apply only to  operators whose vehicles weigh at least 7&middot;5 tons. I welcome the fact that the  Minister has taken on board some of the suggestions that I made in Committee  and has made minor amendments in that regard.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Unlike Mr Ford, I am not disappointed that provision for a  traffic commissioner has not been included in the Bill: I welcome that fact. I  found the commissioner to be overbearing in her role. She put herself on a  pedestal.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  thank the Member for giving way. I wondered whether that represents a further  split between Trevor Clarke and his DUP colleagues. It is always interesting to  count them up.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  The DUP is a democratic party; its members are entitled to their own views. I  am taking part in the debate so that I can express my view.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Unlike Mr Beggs, I am not sure that the Bill will reduce  organised crime. I still have concerns about that, and I hope that the  Department will do more work in that regard. The enforcement team will have  work to do, because I do not envisage that many gangsters will apply for  operator licences.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Does the Member not accept that, if criminal gangs do not have lorries, they  will not be able to move goods around illegally? If they attempt to do so using  someone else&rsquo;s lorry, that operator will risk losing his or her licence. That  will, therefore, make life much more difficult for criminals.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  I just do not know how naive Roy Beggs is at times. From my recollection,  criminals steal lorries or buy them at auctions. We have heard consistently  about illegal fuel lorries on the roads. However, the criminals do not actually  acquire those vehicles by legal means. Therefore, I do not believe that the  Bill will deter them from continuing that activity. Officials will have a job  to do. I call upon them to do more enforcement work in order to tackle  organised crime rather than monitoring legitimate businesses.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome that the purpose of the legislation is to  increase road safety for operators in the sector. I thank the Minister for  accepting the amendments, and I support the Bill.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">11.00 am</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the Consideration Stage of  the Bill and the important part that the Bill will play in improving the image  of the freight sector. The Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) Bill had  been put on the long finger for a number of years by direct rule Ministers. The  industry has been crying out for such a Bill, and it is, therefore, important  that we get it right.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Ireland,  North and South, has some of the worst transport standards in Europe,  and although new legislation to bring the North up to speed has been on the  table since the 1990s, it was never progressed. As the Deputy Chairperson of  the Committee said, the legislation has been &ldquo;a long time coming&rdquo;. I hope that  the Bill marks the start of a process of implementing legislation across the  island and that the Southern Administration will introduce similar legislation  to ensure a degree of consistency.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee debated the Bill extensively, and it  considered that enforcement should remain separate from the legislation to  ensure its effectiveness. The possibility of appointing a traffic commissioner  should be further considered. I echo what other Members said about the  importance of having a clear definition of a small goods vehicle, and amendment  Nos 1 and 2 to clause 1 help to provide that much-needed clarity.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in supports the adoption of all the amend&shy;ments in  group 1, as well as those in groups 2 and 3, because it is vital that the  reputation of the Irish freight and transport industry be improved. The new  Bill provides the opportunity to do exactly that. The legislation is important  for the industry&rsquo;s reputation, and for road safety and haulage drivers.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I  was appointed to the Committee for the Environment only recently so I missed  the excitement of its discussions. I apologise on behalf of the Chairperson of  the Committee, Dolores Kelly, who is not here this morning because she is  dealing with a family bereavement.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP welcomes and supports the Consideration Stage of  the Bill. I was told recently that up to 70% of goods vehicles could have  serious safety deficiencies; the legislation is, therefore, important. I  underline the fact that good operators deserve good legislation and strong  enforcement. The road freight industry is dependent on investment from good  operators, but their efforts are undermined by rogue operators who make no such  investment. In light of the alarming reports about operators that we hear from  time to time, it is extremely fortunate that the number of road traffic  incidents has not been higher. That point has become particularly relevant  since the expansion of the European Union led to many vehicles from other  countries coming here.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I spent more than an hour trying to get through Newry last  night, largely because of heavy goods vehicles, so I do not want to miss the  opportunity to highlight the fact that the railway line that runs alongside the  road is not operational. That is not a matter for today, but we must, at some  stage, consider moving much of the freight from the roads to the railways.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In general, the SDLP warmly welcomes today&rsquo;s progress. At  the beginning of the debate, Peter Weir said that the matter was not, perhaps,  the most exciting, but it is a serious one.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I thank Members for their contributions. The Deputy  Chairperson, speaking on behalf of the Committee, raised several issues, and I  hope to deal with those. The Bill sets out the main provisions for the  enforcement of the licensing of operators of goods vehicles. In the main, those  provisions were reproduced from the Transport Act (Northern Ireland) 1967, which  applies to operators who transport goods and passengers by road.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department will have the power to stop and enter  vehicles and to enter premises in which vehicles are kept. That power does not  apply to private homes unless an application for a magistrate&rsquo;s warrant has  been granted. If it is believed that an offence has been committed, the  Department will have the power to seize documents. The Department may require  the owner, driver or user of a vehicle to provide certain information and  documents, such as the name and address of the owner, a description of the goods  being carried and the journey details.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A person who either wilfully obstructs an officer or fails  to produce documents will be guilty of an offence and will face a fine up to  level 3, which is a &pound;1,000, six months&rsquo; imprisonment or both. The Bill will  allow the Department to issue a certificate containing certain defined  information as evidence for court proceedings.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Schedule 3 contains details of a new power to detain goods  vehicles that are used without an operator&rsquo;s licence. Schedule 3 contains  regulation-making powers, which will provide for the following areas: the  detention of a vehicle and its contents; fixing an immobilisation device to a  vehicle or arranging for it to be moved from the roadside &mdash; tampering with or  removing a clamp will be an offence that will attract a fine of up to &pound;1,000,  and tampering with or removing a notice of immobilisation can carry a fine of  up to &pound;500; the arrangements for the return or disposal of a vehicle and its  contents; the proceeds of the sale of property; and the procedure to be  followed when a dispute occurs over the return or disposal of a vehicle&rsquo;s  contents or the proceeds of any sale. Anyone making a false declaration to  secure the return of a vehicle will be guilty of an offence that attracts a  fine of &pound;5,000, up to two years&rsquo; imprisonment or both. Therefore, the powers of  enforcement are fairly extensive. The issue then comes down to having an  adequate number of staff to deal with that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Committee&rsquo;s view on the need to define &ldquo;in  scope&rdquo; and &ldquo;out of scope&rdquo; clearly, and that will be dealt with further in  regulations.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Weir rightly identified the issue about protecting the  industry, which is why the industry sought for us to introduce the Bill.  Operators who carry out their job in a professional manner will no longer be  faced with the problem of being undercut by people who operate to lower  standards, which is a serious issue. For example, if an overtired driver  operates a vehicle that is overweight and has a faulty brake cylinder, there  could be dangerous consequences. That is why we need to ensure that operators  keep vehicles at the optimum standard.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The issue of operation centres will be dealt with in  regulations. In devising those regulations, I will seek to ensure that we are  practical, do not create onerous burdens and respond to real issues such as I  have just described.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Beggs indicated that the legislation is overdue, and he  referred to organised crime. It will always be difficult to pursue criminals  who are happy to operate outside the law. Nonetheless, the Bill creates a  better licensing and regulation system that will make it easier to catch those  criminals.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Ford said that time had taken its toll on the Committee.  I understand that the Member looked about 25 years old when the process started,  so it certainly has taken a severe toll on him. He referred to the issue of  onerous burdens, as did Mr Weir, and that has been taken on board.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill deals with vehicles that weigh more than 3&middot;5 tons,  regardless of whether they are large fleets of small vehicles. Therefore, the  issue is not about the size of the fleet but about the Bill applying to small  or large goods vehicles that weigh more than 3&middot;5 tons. Trevor Clarke would have  preferred the Bill to apply to vehicles that weigh more than 7&middot;5 tons as  opposed to 3&middot;5 tons, and we have considered that issue. However, European Union  legislation makes it impossible to move away from that 3&middot;5-ton requirement.  That is why the Bill has proceeded using that weight and not a greater weight.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As a result of Trevor Clarke&rsquo;s intervention, we dealt  directly with the issue of consignment notes. His opposition and agitating in  Committee has certainly delivered results.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We see that as beneficial because consignment notes were  not operating in the rest of the United Kingdom and would not have  brought any significant benefit to the Bill. I thank Mr Clarke for that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McKay and Mr Dallat made general comments, and I have  nothing to respond to in that respect.</p>

      <p class="B3BodyText">The second group of amendments is largely made up of  technical amendments that are intended to improve the drafting of the Bill.  Amendment Nos 3 and 4 relate to clause 4; amendment Nos 5 and 6 relate to  clause 24; amendment No 7 relates to clause 26; amendment No 12 relates to  clause 55; amendment No 13 relates to clause 57; and amendment No 14 relates to  schedule 3.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In common with the amendments in the first group, all the  amendments in the second group have been explained in detail to the Committee  and a consensus has been reached.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Members will be aware that the Bill is largely a  replication of the Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) Act 1995 in Great Britain.  Late last year, that Act was amended by the Local Transport Act 2008, and I  want to make sure that the Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) Bill is up  to date with GB legislation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment Nos 3 and 4 are minor, adding the words &ldquo;(if  any)&rdquo; to the existing phrase, &ldquo;the prescribed fee&rdquo;. That is necessary to take  account of situations in which no such fee is prescribed. Such a situation  would arise if an operator were adding a specific vehicle to a licence and a fee  for a previously removed vehicle had already been paid. Obviously, in that  situation, a further fee would not be required.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment Nos 5, 6 and 7 are interrelated. The purpose of  those amendments is to remove an anomaly in the way in which the Department  handles disciplinary proceedings against a licence holder. Currently, under  clause 26, the Department &ldquo;shall not&rdquo; give a direction to revoke, suspend,  curtail or disqualify without first holding an inquiry if a licence holder  requests that it do so. The problem is, how does the licence holder know to ask  for an inquiry when, except for a standard licence revocation in clause 24(3),  there is no requirement on the Department to tell the license holder? To make  clause 26 work correctly, the Department would have to issue such a notice  administratively. It is best to provide for that in the Bill, and, in doing so,  remove any potential for misunderstanding. Taken together, amendment Nos 5, 6  and 7 will impose a responsibility on the Department to issue a notice on all  occasions. The functions relating to those amendments &mdash; revocation, suspension,  curtailment and disqualification of licences &mdash; are all departmental functions  under the Bill, whereas, in GB, the same functions are dealt with by  independent traffic commissioners.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In its report, the Committee made two recommendations in  that regard, which I will now address.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">First, the Committee felt that the licensing function  should be separated clearly from the enforcement function. At present, both  come under the remit of the Driver and Vehicle Agency. I can provide assurance  that, when implementing the Bill, the licensing function will be administered  separately from the DVA, which will retain the enforcement function.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee also recommended that the Department pursue  the feasibility of appointing a traffic commissioner for Northern Ireland  who would have statutory responsibility for, among other things, goods vehicles  licensing. Given that the powers in the Bill are exactly the same as those given  to traffic commissioners in GB and that there will be a separation of the  licensing function, my predecessor, Minister Wilson, decided not to pursue the  traffic commissioner option. That position will be kept under review, so we are  not ruling the option in or out for the future. However, the present task will  be to implement the Bill&rsquo;s provisions as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 12 is a small, technical amendment. I want the  Bill to apply to anyone using a relevant vehicle on any road in Northern Ireland.  Crucially, that includes roads in harbour estates. The intention of clause 55  has always been to ensure that the Bill applies to harbour areas. However, it  appears that the use of the term &ldquo;harbour commissioners&rdquo; in a general sense to  describe the bodies that control harbour areas is wrong, because a number of  harbour areas are not under the control of commissioners and, therefore, will  be excluded from the provisions of the Bill. That is why I propose to amend  clause 55 by replacing the term &ldquo;commissioners&rdquo; with the more comprehensive  term &ldquo;authority&rdquo;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee tabled amendment No 13 to clause 57. I thank  the Chairperson and the Committee, and I am happy to accept that amendment,  because I agree completely with its proposals. As drafted, the Bill provides  for a wide range of regulation-making powers. All but two of those powers will  be subject to negative resolution. In oral evidence sessions in the Committee,  my Department was challenged to look again at all the Bill&rsquo;s secondary  legislation-making powers. During that process, the Department agreed that the  regulations in clause 1(2)(d) on exemptions and in clause 12(12) on the  extension of professional competence, which are requirements for restricted  licence holders, should be subject to affirmative resolution. Therefore, I  agree to the amendment of clause 57(9) to include those two clauses.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 14 is the final amendment in the group and  relates to paragraph 7 of schedule 3 to the Bill. It will give the Department  power to make regulations for a vehicle that is detained under the schedule to  be returned to its owner. Further regulations under paragraph 8 require the  owner to apply to the Department for the return of the vehicle. The proposed  amendment makes it possible for the vehicle to be returned without the owner  having to apply for it. That amendment, which is included already in the  corresponding GB legislation, will mean that there is a consistent approach  across the systems in GB and Northern    Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for the Environment</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a  LeasCheann Comhairle. I send the Committee Chairperson&rsquo;s apologies to the  House; it was remiss of me not to mention that earlier.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Departmental officials briefed the Committee fully on all  the technical amendments. The Committee had initial concerns about clause 4(4),  not least because it is not included in comparable legislation across the  water. Therefore, the Committee sought more information from the Department on  the reasons for its inclusion. Having been advised by the Department that  clause 4(4) would allow for better enforcement of the legislation, provide in  law what England, Scotland and Wales have in practice already and  provide what is required by EU law, the Committee accepted its inclusion. The  Committee also approved amendment Nos 3 and 4 to other subsections of clause 4  to keep the Bill up to date with similar legislation across the water.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier, I mentioned the importance that the Committee  attached to vehicles that will be exempt from the Bill. That will be dealt with  through a secondary legislation-making power, which the Committee urges the  Department to make subject to draft affirmative procedure so that the highest  level of Assembly scrutiny applies to such an important decision.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Similarly, the Committee had concerns about the power to  prescribe a date on which stricter requirements could be placed on applicants  for a restricted licence. Members felt that such a measure could introduce an  element of discretion into the enforcement of the Bill and questioned the risk  of inconsistency. The Department tried to allay concerns by explaining how its  discretion might be used and noted that an appeals procedure would ensure that  inconsistencies could be addressed. Nonetheless, the Committee was keen for  extra scrutiny to be associated with that secondary legislation-raising power  and urged the Department to make it subject to draft affirmative procedure. The  Committee thanks the Minister for taking those concerns into consideration and  welcomes amendment No 13, which will bring those procedures into effect. The  Committee agreed all other proposed amendments in the group.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  am pleased that the Minister referred to traffic commissioners, and I thank him  for proposing to keep that matter &ldquo;under review&rdquo;. However, what does &ldquo;under  review&rdquo; mean in the context of legislation?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate his points about the separation of licensing  and enforcement functions. The reality is that the DVA is an agency of his  Department, and we appear to be creating a situation that is somewhat analogous  to that of the Northern Ireland Environment Agency and the Planning Service,  both of which are agencies of the Department, and, therefore, it is possible to  question the degree of independence between their functions.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">With that in mind, will the Minister tell the House how the  system will operate, given the practical realities, to ensure maximum possible  separation? Moreover, will he outline a timescale in which he will consider  whether it is better to move towards the concept of establishing traffic  commissioners as an entirely independent body?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I thank the Committee for its general support of the  legislation. It is useful that the Department has worked closely with the  Committee to reach this stage of the legislation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Ford mentioned the traffic commissioner. Legislation  would be required to introduce a traffic commissioner in Northern Ireland.  The current system allows a degree of independence and flexibility, and DVA  carries out the licensing aspect. Therefore, we believe that there can be a  degree of independence and separation between the two functions even though  they are in the same Department. A commissioner would be funded by my  Department, too. Therefore, someone who makes the case that there is no true  independence because those who pay the piper call the tune could do so in  relation to a traffic commissioner, although the title &ldquo;independent&rdquo; would be  added.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have always been reluctant to remove powers from the  Assembly and the House, where people are accountable to elected  representatives. I have always been somewhat reticent about giving powers to  people who are independent from political scrutiny. Ultimately, politics is,  for good or ill, the voice of the people. We are elected by the people to do a  job for the people. Therefore, it is always better that the public&rsquo;s serious  concerns about how governance is being delivered can be addressed through  challenges to the process from individuals such as Mr Ford. A process that lacks  an independent challenge mechanism for politicians creates real difficulties  for the public.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Amendment No 3 agreed to.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Amendment No 4 made: In page 4, line 5, after &ldquo;fee&rdquo;  insert &ldquo;(if any)&rdquo;. <span style="font-size:8.5pt; font-style:normal; ">&mdash; </span><span class="Italic"><span style="font-size:8.5pt; ">[The Minister of the Environment (Mr  Poots).]</span></span></p>

      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Clause 5 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextClause">Clause 6 (Operating centres to be specified in  operators&rsquo; licences)</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question proposed, <span style="font-style:normal; ">That  the clause stand part of the Bill.</span></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for the Environment</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a  LeasCheann Comhairle. From the outset of its scrutiny, the Committee had  reservations about the potential effect of the Bill on planning processes. In  particular, the Committee was worried about the Bill&rsquo;s effect on owners of  small businesses who are based at home and are required to designate their  homes as operating centres. The Committee, therefore, seeks the Minister&rsquo;s  assurance that the designation of a property as an operating centre will not,  in itself, have any read-across to planning action, nor will it be used by, or  influence any action of, the Planning Service as to the use of the property.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  First, I thank the Clerk of the Committee for the Environment and the Committee  staff, who had a major task to get everything right for today, including the  drafting of the reports. Departmental officials also had a hard task, to say  the least, in dealing with some of the issues raised, particularly by my  colleague Trevor Clarke. I welcome the fact, as the Minister said, that the  Department was able to take on board the issues that were raised and amend the  Bill accordingly.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As the Deputy Chairperson said, one of the main issues with  clause 6 was the question of planning permission for operating centres owned by  operators of small businesses who are based at home. In his contribution to the  debate, the Deputy Chairperson sought clarity on the assurance that the  designation of an operating centre will not have any read-across to planning  action. I ask the Minister to clarify whether owners of small businesses who  operate from home will require planning permission, and, if so, under what  circumstances. Will he indicate whether there is a limit on the size of vehicle  that can be kept at an operator&rsquo;s home?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  Again, I make no apology for being one of those who raised the most concerns  about the operating centres. My feelings are similar to those expressed by the  Minister in his reply to Mr Ford: I am an elected representative for the people  and I want to work for them while I am here.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I can see how the Bill&rsquo;s provisions for operating centres  could have caused some difficulties. Although I am glad that the Minister has  given us assurances that that will not be the case, I was disappointed when, on  more than one occasion, Planning Service officials could not give the Committee  clear guidance on how those provisions will work in practice. However, I trust  that the Minister will use his authority to make it clear to the Planning  Service that it must provide such guidance.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Like my colleague, I still have reservations about how the  read-across will be determined. Will it apply retrospectively to people who are  already in business? Will it prevent others who want to start businesses from  doing so from an operating centre beside their homes? Will the rights that are  granted to those who have been in business for several years follow them if  they decide to relocate? There are still questions to be answered, and I hope  that the Minister will provide some clarity.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Clause 6 deals with operating centres. I will address the  second of the three recommendations on operating centres that the Committee  made in its report on the Bill.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Following a designation by the Department of a place as an  operating centre under the Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) Bill, the  issue of read-across into interest or action by the Planning Service may be of  concern to some. I assure Members that the designation of a property as an  operating centre will not in itself have any read-across into planning action,  nor will it be used by or influence any action by the Planning Service as to  the use of the property.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Irrespective of that assurance, it is the responsibility of  all landowners to ensure that the use of their property satisfies the  requirements of planning laws.</p>

      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Minister has given notice of his intention to oppose clause  50&rsquo;s standing part of the Bill and the associated schedule 4&rsquo;s being agreed to.  Clause 50 deals with documentation requirements for drivers of large goods  vehicles.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question proposed, <span style="font-style:normal; ">That  the clause stand part of the Bill.</span></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of the  Environment</strong>: I oppose clause 50&rsquo;s standing part of the Bill and the  associated schedule 4&rsquo;s being agreed to. Schedule 4 is a replication of  schedule 5 to the Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) Act 1995 in Great Britain and was originally included to  enable Northern Ireland  to remain in line with GB legislation. It contains provision for the carriage  of consignment notes in large goods vehicles; namely, a document containing  certain details about the nature of goods that are being carried in the vehicle.  However, that provision of the GB Act has never been enacted or brought into  operation. Furthermore, it appears that the provisions are out of date and  would have to be amended before being commenced in Great Britain.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It would be best to remove clause 50 and schedule 4 from  the Bill altogether. If the provision is ever needed, it can be made at that  time. Removal of the clause and schedule will not affect the remainder of the  Bill or the way in which goods vehicles operators are licensed.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy Chairperson  of the Committee for the Environment</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann  Comhairle. The Committee welcomes the Minister&rsquo;s opposition to clause 50  standing part of the Bill and schedule 4 being agreed to. The Committee  questioned the need for separate additional classification for larger vehicles  and the requirement for consignment notes to be carried. The Department  indicated subsequently that it could find no justifiable reason for the  inclusion of clause 50 and noted that the provision has never been enacted  across the water. The Committee agreed that the Bill would be improved by  excluding clause 50 and schedule 4.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I thank the Committee for the views that have been  expressed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and negatived.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Clause 50 disagreed to.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Clause 51 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextClause">New Clause</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: We now come to the third group of amendments for debate. There is  only one amendment, which is amendment No 11.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I beg to move amendment No 11: After clause 51, insert the  following new clause:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Payment of grants</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">51A.&mdash;(1) The Department may, with the approval of the  Department of Finance and Personnel, pay such grants to such persons or bodies  as it considers appropriate in connection with any provision of, or the  purposes of, this Act.</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">(2) Grants under this section shall be subject to such  terms and conditions as the Department may, with the approval of the Department  of Finance and Personnel, determine.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The insertion of clause 51A will provide my Department with  the power to make grants available to individuals or bodies in connection with  operator licensing. Inclusion of that power is prudent and reflects a similar  power that was included in the Taxis Act (Northern Ireland) 2008. It will  give my Department the power to make grants in certain circumstances, although  I do not envisage the power having to be used very often. Any grant to be made  available would be subject to terms and conditions and the prior approval of  the Department of Finance and Personnel.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for the Environment</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a  LeasCheann Comhairle. Throughout the Committee Stage, members expressed  misgivings about the impact that the Bill may have on small businesses. The  Committee very much welcomes the Minister&rsquo;s decision to insert clause 51A,  which makes provision for grants to be paid to persons or bodies in connection  with the provisions of the Bill. The Committee supports amendment No 11.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I call the Minister to make a winding-up speech.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I have nothing further to add, other than to thank the  Committee for its support.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I am sorry; I forgot to call Mr Alastair Ross. I now call Mr  Alastair Ross.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  am something of an afterthought, but, nevertheless, I welcome the opportunity  to speak about this part of the Bill. The purpose of the Bill has been  explained in relation to other groups of amendments. A few years ago, I was hit  by a McCullough Transport lorry when I was driving my car, so I know from  personal experience that those sorts of lorries can be lethal weapons on our  roads. Certainly, any legislation to improve road safety is to be welcomed, and  we have already heard that Committee members agree.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Many of the concerns have been dealt with in the earlier  amendments, but we were concerned about the impact that this legislation will  have on the industry as a whole and particularly on smaller operators. We were  worried that, if we moved ahead of the Irish  Republic, the industry in Northern Ireland  would be at a disadvantage. The addition of clause 51A certainly goes some way  towards alleviating some of those concerns by creating the power for the Department  to make grants available to individuals or bodies in connection with operator  licensing. We are aware that similar enabling legislation was included in the  Taxis Act (Northern Ireland)  2008. The Minister stated that it is not envisaged that that power will ever  need to be used. We hope that the industry is never at such an economic  disadvantage that the Department will need to use the power. However, at least  the Department, after approval from the Department of Finance and Personnel,  can use that power if the industry needs help in the form of grants. I have no  difficulty in supporting the new clause.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I assure Mr Ross that he is not an afterthought. His  contribution is always valued. I thank him for the comments that he made, and I  agree fully with them, particularly in the spirit of party unity.</p>

      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Members will have a copy of the Marshalled List of amendments  detailing the order for consideration. The amendments have been grouped for  debate in my provisional grouping of amendments selected list.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There are two groups of amendments, and we will debate the  amendments in each group in turn. The first debate will be on amendment Nos 1,  2, 3 and 4, which deal with the process by which the Minister is appointed. The  opposition to clause 2 notified by Alex Attwood and others will also be  debated. The second debate will be on amendment Nos 5 and 6, which deal with  the commencement of the Act.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I remind Members who intend to speak during the debates on  the two groups of amendments that they should address all the amendments in  each group on which they wish to comment. Once the initial debate on each group  has been completed, any subsequent amendments in the group will be moved  formally as we go through the Bill, and the Question on each will be put  without further debate. The Questions on stand part will be taken at the  appropriate points in the Bill. If that is clear, we shall proceed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextClause">Clause 1 (The Department of Justice)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: We now come to the first group of amendments for debate. With  amendment No 1, it will be convenient to debate amendment Nos 2, 3 and 4 and  opposition to clause 2, as notified by Alex Attwood and others.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Those amendments deal with the process by which the  Minister is appointed. Clause 2 sets out a model for the appointment of the  Minister. The amendments would place reporting obligations on the First  Minister and deputy First Minister relating to the establishment of the  Department and the appointment of the Minister, with implications for that  appointment.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Those amendments are also related to amendment No 5 in  group 2, which deals both with the commencement and sequencing of the  appointment of the Minister. I draw it to Members&rsquo; attention that amendment No  1 is a paving amendment for amendment Nos 2, 3 and 4. Amendment Nos 3 and 4 are  consequential to amendment No 2.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I call Mr Alex Attwood to move amendment No 1 and to  address the other amendments in that group and his opposition to clause 2.</p>

      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Business Office and other Assembly staff who  provided significant assistance to me and the SDLP when preparing the  amendments, and I thank those who agreed to the amendments being tabled in the  form that we have before us. In addition, I thank the First Minister and the  deputy First Minister for attending. It will be interesting to see whether at  least one of them lasts the pace in the course of the next number of hours.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will speak to the first group of amendments: amendment  Nos 1, 2, 3 and 4 and the opposition to clause 2. Before I get into the detail  of the amendments and the reasons that inform the SDLP&rsquo;s thinking about them,  it would be fair to capture, on the one hand, what opposition to clause 2 means  and, on the other, what amendment Nos 1, 2, 3 and 4 mean. For the sake of  convenience, I shall do that before I get into technical and political details.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Ultimately, the purpose of the amendments is simple and the  purpose of opposing clause 2 is simple. If clause 2 falls, the only provision  for filling the justice Minister position will be that in the Northern Ireland  Act 1998. Since then, under legislation in 2006, 2007 and 2009, there have been  various models that, further to negotiation, might be used to fill the justice  Minister position. I am not going to rehearse those models, because, subsequent  to political negotiations, various Secretaries of State amended that large menu  of models in the House of Commons. In the SDLP&rsquo;s view, opposition to clause 2  captures the fact that those models are not appropriate. The appropriate way to  proceed is to revert to the provisions in the Good Friday Agreement for electing  Ministers to office. At the end of my speech, I will explain why the SDLP  believes that opposition to clause 2 is the right way to proceed from the point  of view of the law, the party&rsquo;s politics and the community&rsquo;s needs.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment Nos 1, 2, 3, and 4 approach the matter in a  different way. In essence, they invite the First Minister and the deputy First  Minister to come clean to the Assembly and explain in the course of the debate  or, under the proposed amendment, at a subsequent time the consequences in May  2012 if there is no agreement at that time about how the justice Ministry  portfolio will be filled. The SDLP has a view about the procedure that will  kick in then. We are asking the Assembly to stand back from the politics and  the current toing and froing on the devolution of policing and justice and, as  a legislature, create legal certainty and political confidence in what will  happen in 2012. The SDLP is saying that, if the Assembly does so, it will be  acting in a manner that will avoid damaging public confidence at that time.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP&rsquo;s amendments invite the Assembly to consider the  true consequences and risks in 2012 of following the route proposed by the  First Minister, the deputy First Minister, the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in. We suggest  that the Assembly considers those difficult matters afresh and looks on our  amendments as a way to navigate through them in order to come to a conclusion  that is consistent with and supports the amendments. That is, essentially, the  political argument that the SDLP advances for its position on clause 2 and for  amendment Nos 1, 2, 3 and 4.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I turn to the consequences of amendment Nos 1, 2, 3 and 4.  I will not detain the Assembly in respect of amendment No 1, which inserts the  words &ldquo;upon the designated day&rdquo; into clause 1 after the word &ldquo;established&rdquo;.  That can be understood only after consideration of amendment Nos 2, 3 and 4.  After my explanation of those amendments, the significance of that insertion  will become clear.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 2 is the first of our substantive amendments.  Its text is on the Marshalled List, so I will not read it out. Some will  consider the amendment obscure, as not belonging to the real political world or  not of immediate relevance. We say this: we are as close to May 2012 as we are  to May 2007. We are 30 months into restoration and 30 months away from May  2012, when a serious risk to the authority of the Assembly and to public  confidence may arise. Some see the amendment as obscure, irrelevant or not of  the real world. However, when one considers the position 30 months after  restoration and what may or may not happen over the next 30 months, it is clear  that this is the moment when Members should stand back, create certainty and  eliminate doubt and let Members, political parties and the wider community know  what will happen in May 2012.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Almost everyone in the Chamber is of good intent, but not  all. There are some here and outside who cling to a past that is already dying.  However, in the round, Members have made essential political choices about the  nature of society and the future of Irish democracy. I welcome that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is essential to understanding amendment No 2 and the SDLP&rsquo;s  proposed new clause that one cannot disregard the fact that, 30 months into  restoration, it is impossible to divorce all the progress that we have made  from the many issues on which progress has been slower than expected. We have  not yet agreed a new shared future strategy; a date for the devolution of justice  and important details connected with that; an Irish language Bill; a stadium at  the Maze site; how best to manage disputed parades; or how to address the past.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to focus on the Bill that is before the House and  the issues associated with it.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I concur, and I anticipated your intervention, Mr Deputy Speaker. I made those  points because, as a result of the experience of the last 30 months, we should  caution ourselves. In May 2012, under the provisions of the Bill, the justice  Department will be dissolved. No one disputes that. People say that, between  now and then, political agreement will be reached on what will happen in May  2012 so that we can avoid dissolution of the Department of justice.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">12.00 noon</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The essential political point, and the point of proposed  amendment No 2, is that, based on the experience of the past 30 years, no one  in the Chamber can say with their hand on their heart and with total confidence  and conviction that we will have resolved the issue of the election or  nomination of a justice Minister by May 2012, thereby avoiding a situation in  which the justice Department will be dissolved. Given what remains unresolved  and the tensions and the toing and froing around the current devolution of  justice negotiation, how can we be confident that 30 months from now &mdash; a hop, a  skip and a jump in the lifetime of this country &mdash; the issue of the future  justice Ministry will be resolved satisfactorily and that a new model will have  been put in place to avoid the dissolution?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That is what the SDLP is inviting Members to consider  today: it is inviting them to put themselves in the real political world of the  moment and consider how that will play out during the next 30 months. We hope  that, by 2012, our Assembly will have matured and our parties will have deepened  their wisdom to have resolved those matters. However, we cannot have that  certainty or conviction. Proposed amendment No 2 invites the Assembly to  consider all of that, to work it through and, perhaps, to come to a conclusion,  contrary to what orthodoxy suggests, that is consistent with what the SDLP says  in the amendment. Essentially, proposed amendment No 2 enables the Assembly to  work through the issues with its eyes wide open, aware of all the risks and  pitfalls, and to put in place a mechanism to legislate against those issues.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Before I go through what new clause 2A of the Department of  Justice Bill will mean if proposed amendment No 2 is accepted, I must explain  something to the House. It is a convention and a standard of law and  parliamentary practice in the North that, although direction and control of a  Department rest with the Minister, it is the Department itself that holds the  legal authority and powers. That is why the Northern Ireland Act 1998, and the  various pieces of legislation that deal with the devolution of justice to the  North, refer not to a Minister as having authority and power, but the  Department. The Department has the power; the Minister has only command and  control.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, let us think through the consequences of what happens  in May 2012 when, as everybody agrees, under the current legislation and in the  absence of other agreement, the justice Department dissolves. Mr Ford, or any  other person who may be forthcoming, may be the Minister for justice, but the  Minister for justice will not have a Department. It is a self-evident truth  accepted by everybody that, under the current provisions and in the absence of  agreement by May 2012, Mr Ford, Mr Kennedy or Mr Maginness &mdash; the last named  would be my choice &mdash; <em>[Interruption.]</em> Any of those individuals, or any  other individual, would have the ministerial car and may even have a  ministerial office and people visiting that office. However, he or she would  not have the ability to do anything in that office because the Department of justice  will have been dissolved.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">However, that is not the real issue about a Department of  justice being dissolved in May 2012. Proposed new clause 2A(b) in amendment No  2 deals with that, as it would oblige the First Minister and deputy First  Minister at a certain time &mdash; I will return to that in a minute &mdash; to come to  thes Floor of the Assembly and explain what will happen in 2012.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">According to our view of the world and to our lawyers&rsquo;  advice, in the absence of agreement in May 2012, there will be dissolution. The  consequence of that would be the criminal justice system not just grinding to a  halt, but being put in potentially grave risk. Although a Minister may be in  office, what happens when a Department does not exist? What happens to the  management of the Prison Service, the payment of compensation to victims,  police forensic science work, and youth justice provisions?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">All those functions are mentioned in amendment No 2,  because they are all functions of a Department of justice. They would not  necessarily be handled by a Minister for justice, but they would, nonetheless,  be the Department&rsquo;s responsibility. What happens with all those services and  needs in the event of the Department not existing? What will be done about the  risk to the public? Come May 2012, we face the potential of a Department no  longer existing and, as a consequence, the criminal justice arrangements of  which I spoke, and much besides, not being able to function and maintain good  authority.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  am sorry for not having been here for the start of the Member&rsquo;s speech, but I  have been in the Chamber for about 15 minutes, and in that part of the Member&rsquo;s  contribution, he talked about when we reach failure, if we do not reach  agreement, and the Armageddon that will happen in May 2012. Perhaps all our  energies should be directed towards ensuring that we do reach agreement.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We all have a collective responsibility to ensure that 2012  is a date when the justice Ministry continues, local politicians continue to  hold control of justice and policing powers and we have an effective system in  place. Perhaps the Member should come round to that way of thinking, instead of  doing what the SDLP has done thus far in not only this debate but in the entire  debate about policing and justice, which is to focus on its negative role in  politics rather than finding a positive and constructive role.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  Perhaps if the Member had been here for the beginning of my speech &mdash; although I  am sure that his absence was for reasons beyond his control &mdash; he might have  been minded not to make that intervention. I remind the Member that there was  nothing negative about what the SDLP did in those difficult years up to 2007,  when it went on the Policing Board to fulfil the mandate of the Good Friday  Agreement that the devolution of policing and justice would happen in the  context of ongoing implementation of policing and justice change.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We are having a debate today about the nature, character  and timing of the devolution of justice and policing because the SDLP and others  went about the task of implementing justice and policing change. If that job  had not been undertaken by the SDLP and others &mdash; I have spoken in this Chamber  and elsewhere about the fine and brave work that was done by the Ulster  Unionist Party, the Democratic Unionist Party and the community members of the  Policing Board &mdash; in very difficult circumstances, when there was suspension,  when there were still people stealing information not far from here, robbing  banks not far from here and demonising those who were in the police and those  who were trying to endorse the policing arrangements &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I wonder when Mr Attwood will go back  to talking about the Bill.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I think that the previous intervention led Mr Attwood into that  particular angle. I am sure that he will get back on track.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  Thank you for that ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker. I will return to the Bill and to  the other pieces of legislation that surround and govern the Bill.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We are able to have this debate because of the twilight  struggle &mdash; for want of a better term &mdash; during those years when members of the  SDLP and other parties on the Policing Board and in the district policing  partnerships made their choices about policing. Nationalists would be opposing  the devolution of justice and policing today, were it not for the work that was  done and for the heavy lifting and big issues that were dealt with in the years  up to 2007, before other parties joined the Policing Board.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is an utter contradiction in what Mr O&rsquo;Dowd has  outlined. He rightly suggests to me and to everybody else that we should work  to avoid a default situation in 2012. However, who endorsed the dissolution of  the Ministry in 2012? Which party argued and supported that provision? It was  Mr O&rsquo;Dowd&rsquo;s party. In order to get out of the hole into which it dug itself and  the dead end that it faced when it was outmanoeuvred and out-thought by the  First Minister on the need for cross-community support at all times for all times,  Sinn F&eacute;in, in its desperation, signed up to, endorsed, supported and, no doubt,  negotiated for, a sunset clause for the dissolution of the justice Ministry in  2012. Sinn F&eacute;in need not argue with us about the obligation to get new  arrangements in place by 2012 and berate us for saying that there might not be  new arrangements by then, when it was the architect of that political dead end.  It was Sinn F&eacute;in who worked with others to put into law the issue that  amendment No 2 deals with.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  I am confused. Will the Member clarify whether he and his party are against the  principle of sunset clauses? The SDLP claims credit for securing a sunset  clause in the St Andrews Agreement. I want some clarity on whether the SDLP is  against the principle of establishing a sunset clause.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I ask the Member to bear with me, because I will give her absolute reassurance.  I intend to read into the record the pedigree of the sunset clause that Sinn  F&eacute;in endorsed and the SDLP&rsquo;s views on sunset clauses, later in my contribution.  I will come to that when I go further into amendment No 2 and to amendment No  3.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Under the legislation as drafted, the Department will  dissolve. Through amendment No 2, we are saying that, given the grave risks  that will arise in that regard, an obligation on the First Minister and the  deputy First Minister to report to the Assembly on certain matters will get to  the heart of what will happen in 2012, legislate against worst practice and  avoid excess. Amendment No 2 calls on the First Minister and the deputy First  Minister to do that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will go through amendment No 2 in some detail, because it  needs to be understood. Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP&rsquo;s view is that once the Ministry  is dissolved, there will be a vacuum and, in the absence of political agreement,  nothing will be able to be done about it.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP&rsquo;s essential point is that Westminster, sometimes referred to as &ldquo;the  mother of all Parliaments&rdquo;, with its knowledge of drafting Bills and  legislating for certainty, does not legislate for a vacuum. Contrary to what  departmental officials and the First Minister said in Committee and in the  Chamber, the SDLP believes that, in the event of the dissolution of the  Department in May 2012, even though the sunset clause will kick in, there will  be provision in legislation, by design or by default, for what happens next.  Given all the toing and froing and the merry-go-round in respect of the  devolution of justice and policing, we deserve to know, and the public needs  certainty about, what will happen in those circumstances in 2012, namely in the  absence of the political agreement that Mr O&rsquo;Dowd rightly encourages us all to  meet.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP believes that a sunset clause would not dissolve  the Department; instead, the Secretary of State would intervene, and I will  explain why. The amendment requires the First Minister and the deputy First  Minister at a certain time, which I will come to shortly, to come to the Chamber  to fulfil a number of reporting functions, including informing us of the  circumstances that will arise after May 2012. That is the SDLP&rsquo;s argument for  what will happen in 2012, and why there is such an urgent obligation on the  First Minister and the deputy First Minister to make that report to the  Assembly.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Under the Northern Ireland Act 2009, which is the relevant Westminster legislation,  the Department will automatically be dissolved on 1 May 2012, unless the  Assembly &mdash; this goes back to Mr O&rsquo;Dowd&rsquo;s point &mdash; votes by cross-community  support before 1 May 2012 to keep it. Alternatively, the Northern Ireland Act  2009 provides for another Act of the Assembly to provide for the justice  Department to continue after 1 May 2012, provided that that Act uses a specific  model, and it goes on to outline two models under the 2009 Act or under another  authority. However, the critical point is that if no second Act is passed or if  no cross-community vote is made in 2012, the Department will be dissolved, even  though, as Mr O&rsquo;Dowd indicated, Mr Ford would remain in post.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The dissolution of the Department would mean that the civil  servants who are responsible for the justice system, including all those in  next-step agencies, could not act as such. That includes the Prison Service,  with obvious startling consequences. All of that is explained in paragraph 8 of  schedule 1 to the Northern Ireland Act 2009. However, the critical point is  that, owing to the extraordinary if not dangerous implications of the  dissolution of the Department, we believe that that Act also provides for  fallback arrangements, contrary to what the First Minister and the deputy First  Minister said in their letter of 18 November 2009 to the Assembly and Executive  Review Committee, which explicitly stated that there would be no fallback  arrangements.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">To avoid the total crash of dissolving the Department and  all the consequences for the Department and the next-step agencies, paragraph  5(2)(b) of schedule 1 to the 2009 Act states:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;they are not to apply at all if an Order in Council  has been made under section 21A(7C) of the 1998 Act.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That provision in the 1998 Act was inserted as a result of  the Justice and Security (Northern Ireland) Act 2007, which, along with other  provisions, allows the Secretary of State to impose the model for the  devolution of justice, namely the appointment of a senior and a junior justice  Minister, and that is what we believe will happen. Therefore, contrary to all  the reassurances that the Department will be dissolved and that no Minister  will be in place in May 2012, the fallback arrangements will be that, under the  2009 Act, the First Minister and the deputy First Minister will appoint a  senior and a junior justice Minister by cross-community vote.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will return to the relevance of that to the proposed  clause 2A. We are calling on the First Minister and deputy First Minister to  come to the House within seven days of the commencement of the section and  outline, orally and in writing, the functions that the Department is to  exercise. That is important as a matter of principle. After all the debate and  discussion about the devolution of policing and justice, it seems to us  appropriate and relevant that the First Minister and deputy First Minister  should come to the Floor of the House at that stage and explain in full detail  what the full functions of the Department of justice will be when it is  established.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The First Minister and deputy First Minister should explain  to the House &mdash; if our analysis is correct about what happens in 2012 &mdash; what  happens, under the relevant legislation, when dissolution arises, to all the work  and functions of the Department of justice. At that stage, it will be left in a  vacuum, without appropriate legal authority, and with a Minister without a  Department. They should go further and explain that &mdash; sorry, I have lost my  thought &mdash; as the proposed clauses 2C and 2D explain.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The real importance of our amendments is not just in  relation to clause 2. The cutting edge of amendment Nos 1, 2, 3 and 4 is  amendment No 3. I am sure that the deputy First Minister and others appreciate  that. We are saying that there should be consequences if the report from the  First Minister and deputy First Minister to the House is not tabled, or if  certain actions are not taken by the Assembly arising from that clause. I will  explain what all that means.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The new clause 2B does the important work. It provides that  clause 2 of the Bill &mdash; which triggers the Northern Ireland Act 2009, and sets  the clock on the May 2012 deadline &mdash; will be repealed if the First Minister and  deputy First Minister do not make the report within seven days. It also  provides that clause 2 will be repealed if the Assembly does not, within a  further seven days, approve the triggering of the 2009 Act. Clause 3 provides for  commencement, which I will speak about later.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The importance of that is as follows. The First Minister  and deputy First Minister should come to the House and explain what they  believe will happen in 2012. As I have said, we consider the consequences of dissolution  to be grave, if not acute. We are suggesting that, in the event that the First  Minister and deputy First Minister do not come to the House within seven days,  as provided for in the amendment, the allocation of the justice Minister falls  back to the provisions of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 and to the d&rsquo;Hondt  provisions.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We go further and propose that, in the event that the  Assembly does not endorse the arrangements and the report given to the Assembly  by the First Minister and deputy First Minister within seven days, including  the consequences of dissolution in May 2012, the allocation of the justice  Minister should be governed by the d&rsquo;Hondt provisions of the Northern Ireland  Act 1998.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We are giving responsibility, ownership and authority to this  Assembly to make the judgment call that, if the consequences of dissolution in  May 2012 are so severe and grave, and the people of Northern Ireland would not  tolerate a situation where the justice Department did not exist &mdash; with all the  consequences for the justice services and the people in the North &mdash; this  Assembly should have the ability to say no.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In those circumstances, the Assembly should be able to say  that those consequences are of such gravity that it would rather choose to go  back to the d&rsquo;Hondt model for the allocation of the justice Ministry than for  the provisions that are outlined in clause 2. That is the essential political  argument, and that is the choice that the Assembly must make.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If our argument about what will happen in 2012 is correct,  the Assembly should caution and warn itself, and, in doing so, it should call  on the First Minister and deputy First Minister to explain orally and in  writing to the Assembly the consequences of that. The Assembly should call on  the First Minister and deputy First Minister to do that within a month from  today, in December 2009, which is when clause 3, as amended, would go live. If  those consequences are so grave and acute, a different direction should be  taken.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It may be, as we anticipate, that the First Minister and  deputy First Minister will not make any oral or written report on the  consequences of what will happen in May 2012. If that were to happen, so be it;  d&rsquo;Hondt would prevail. However, if that provision were accepted and the First  Minister and deputy First Minister were to make that report, it would be up to  the Assembly to endorse it. If the Assembly were to feel that the consequences  of dissolution in May 2012 were too grave and severe, it would not choose to  endorse the report of the First Minister and deputy First Minister. In that  event, the provisions of d&rsquo;Hondt would prevail. That is the consequence of  proposed new clauses 2A, 2B and 2C.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That is what we are asking as we approach the lunch break. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. The Member has the Floor.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I hear jeering from my right and laughter from my left, and neither is  appropriate.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The essential political issue of this week, recent weeks  and, no doubt, coming weeks has been the nature and character of the devolution  of justice and policing. We have struggled for a long time to bring about the  devolution of justice and policing, and having those powers will be important  for the community to deal with crime, the fear of crime and the unresolved  matters of the Public Prosecution Service and to bring about the further reform  of the Prison Service. If we believe that having custody and stewardship of  those issues, responsibility to legislate and policy that better informs how  society develops in future, it is reckless and naive, 30 months away from May  2012, for the Assembly not to have its eyes wide open. Given our experience of  the past 30 months, we must go into the next 30 months fully aware and informed  of what the consequences of what we are doing might be. That is the  significance of a report from the First Minister and deputy First Minister  going to the Floor of the Assembly, as is proposed in amendment No 2. It would  compel the First Minister and deputy First Minister to inform the House of  their best advice on what would happen in 2012.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If we are serious about being legislators, and if we value  the devolution of justice and policing so much, we owe it to ourselves, never  mind our constituents and the wider public in Northern Ireland, to ensure that  there is no doubt about what will happen in 2012. There must be certainty so  that people can go forward confidently and know that what I trust will happen  in the next number of weeks will not be reopened and revisited in May 2012.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Do we not owe it to ourselves and to all the people who  have observed, over the past weeks and months, the discussion on devolution of  policing and justice to have certainty about what will happen every day between  now and 30 months&rsquo; time, and, crucially, what will happen on 1 May 2012?  Amendment No 2 argues for that certainty. The Assembly must consider it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We cannot fly blindly. We must go forward with our eyes  wide open. There must be legal certainty. We cannot jeopardise the hard-won  gains of the devolution of justice powers, if that transpires over the next 30  months, by allowing it to disappear in a puff of smoke. The essence of the  amendment, and its political and legal significance, is its ability to build  community confidence.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The First Minister has spoken about community confidence  eloquently and at length. However, I have certain differences with him in that  regard. How will it affect community confidence if the Assembly cannot say with  certainty what will happen in May 2012, and if it tells the Northern Ireland  public that the Department of justice will be dissolved? How does that add one  iota of confidence about the administration of policing and justice, and about  the certainty and stability of those political arrangements until May 2012,  never mind in and around that date? I suggest that it does not.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Deputy Speaker, I will be guided by you on whether I can  continue to speak. I still have to speak to other amendments in the group.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: We can resume the debate after lunch. The Business Committee has  arranged to meet upon the lunchtime suspension. I, therefore, propose, by leave  of the Assembly, to suspend the sitting until 2.00 pm, when Mr Attwood will  continue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The sitting was suspended at 12.30 pm.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">On resuming &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Speaker in the Chair)</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">2.02 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I have some concluding remarks to make on amendment Nos 1, 2, 3 and 4. Proposed  new clause 2B simply legislates for the grave, perhaps catastrophic,  circumstances that may arise in May 2012. I understand that some Members may  not want to talk about that, because they hope that, given the potential for  political negotiations between now and then, such circumstances will not arise.  Nonetheless, such a grave situation could arise.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mindful of that backdrop to the debate, amendment No 3  would create a responsibility, initially for the First Minister and the deputy  First Minister, and subsequently for the Assembly, to manage that situation.  Under amendment No 3, if the First Minister and the deputy First Minister were  minded not to table a report, as required by amendment No 2 &mdash; perhaps in  recognition of a situation that may arise in 2012 &mdash; d&rsquo;Hondt would be run.  Alternatively, the First Minister and the deputy First Minister may be minded  to table a report orally and in writing, but the Assembly may choose not to  endorse it within seven days because of concern about what the First Minister  and the deputy First Minister were advising it to do. In such circumstances,  authority would pass to the Assembly, clause 2 would be repealed, and d&rsquo;Hondt  would apply.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate that other parties have chosen not to use d&rsquo;Hondt  to allocate the Department of justice. However, they would share an equal  responsibility with all other parties and Members to make a judgement about the  circumstances that may, in the absence of political agreement, arise in 2012  and assess whether not using d&rsquo;Hondt is a credible position.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Before dealing with whether clause 2 should stand part of  the Bill, I will address amendment No 4, which outlines the time frame for  amendment Nos 1, 2 and 3. Those three amendments have such substance and weight  that the Bill must show how they would be managed should they become law.  Amendment No 4 proposes a new clause, 2C, which is crucial to the eventual  appointment of a Minister. Circumstances may arise that may govern the timing  of the amendments.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The day after Royal Assent is granted &mdash; whenever that may  be after the likely agreement to this legislation &mdash; time will run for the First  Minister and deputy First Minister to report to the Assembly, and seven days  thereafter, time will run for the Assembly to either endorse or not endorse  that report. The interpretation clause in amendment No 4 outlines the relevant  timing features.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The amendments will mean that the day following the day  that the report is due is the designated date for the appointment of the  Minister. In the event that no report is made, that appointment will not  happen. The report may be made but not adopted, or the report may be made and  adopted by resolution of the Assembly, the day after which the Department will  go live. That is how amendment No 4 relates to proposed new clauses 2A and 2B.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Ultimately, a political judgement must be made in respect  of the four amendments. Members must make one of two choices in respect of  those amendments. Members may concur that doubts may, even residually, exist  about the situation that might arise in 2012, because the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in  believe, on balance if not more than that, that there will be a vacuum if the  Department is dissolved in 2012. During today&rsquo;s debate and debates at the  Bill&rsquo;s Second Stage and Committee Stage, I have said that there is some doubt  about what will or will not happen in 2012. Even the First Minister and  departmental officials are beginning to acknowledge that. Indeed, departmental  officials said &mdash; it is recorded in the Hansard report &mdash; that, if there were a  legal issue about the interpretation of what will happen in 2012, that would be  a matter for the courts.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If, after all the sound and fury about the nature,  character and timing of the devolution of justice, we are left a situation in  which we have to rely on the courts to decide what should happen in May 2012,  we will not have served the overall project of the devolution of justice, nor  will we have achieved its potential for the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Officials are beginning to acknowledge that there may be a  need for legal interpretation by the courts. In fact, departmental officials  told the Committee that they had spoken to people with knowledge of the legislation  that was tabled and passed by the Westminster Parliament in 2009 and they  indicated that it was not the intention of the legislation to create a fallback  position in 2012. Consequently, we cannot rule out the possible need for legal  interpretation. Given that the First Minister has said that this matter may be open  to interpretation and given that departmental officials, acting on behalf of  the First Minister and deputy First Minister, advised the OFMDFM Committee that  this might be a matter for the law and that it was not the intention of the  original legislation to create a fallback in 2012, Members should consider  whether the Bill, as currently drafted, provides certainty about what will  happen in 2012 and will allow us to legislate in a way that satisfies the  needs, concerns and fears of the communities that we represent.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I suggest to all parties &mdash; perhaps more to one or two  parties than to others &mdash; that they should consider whether this is a better  model for taking the matter forward in order to satisfy themselves and the  wider community about the situation that might arise in 2012. Essentially, that  is the political choice. However, that is the imperative choice that we, as a  legislature, have to make when we vote on the amendments.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If it is the view of the First Minister and deputy First  Minister and their respective parties that there is certainty around the  devolution of policing and justice, the new clause proposed by amendment No 2  is a defence of their position, not a sword to attack it. Even the First Minister  and deputy First Minister may feel that they should be creating that level of  certainty on those matters for their purposes and for the purposes of the wider  community.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Alternatively, it may be that the First Minister and deputy  First Minister are minded not to go in that direction. In that case, some  people may acknowledge and accept, deep in the recesses of their minds, that  there is a fallback position. Although one party may be coy about acknowledging  that, another party may be worried on the basis that it has relied upon a  sunset provision and there will be no fallback position in May 2012. Those are  the options that all parties must choose between. When it comes to the vote, I  urge Members to make the choice that the SDLP is putting forward.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP opposes clause 2 standing part of the Bill.  Amendment No 6, which will be debated subsequently with amendment No 5, under  timing issues, relates to clause 2.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Throughout the consideration of the devolution of policing  and justice on the Floor of the House, in Committee and elsewhere, the SDLP has  argued for a position of principle. Given what I have just said about the other  amendments, about the degree of uncertainty, about what could happen in 2012  and about the potential chaos that might arise in those circumstances, is it  not a better and sounder position &mdash; independent of our views around the form  and nature of the devolution of policing and justice powers and who can or  cannot become a justice Minister &mdash; to go back to the d&rsquo;Hondt provisions? Even at  such a late stage, we urge people to consider that as the position of principle  and certainty. That is what our opposition to clause 2 does. If we reject the  clause, the provisions of the various pieces of legislation from 2006, 2007 and  2009 will not prevail. Further, the Northern Ireland Act 1998 and the d&rsquo;Hondt  provisions of section 18 therein will prevail. Given what we said about  amendment Nos 1 to 4, that is a better position and one of principle and strength.  That is a better basis on which to move forward with the devolution of policing  and justice powers, avoiding the pitfalls, avoiding a rerun of negotiations and  avoiding the risk of what could happen in 2012.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP is using clause 2 as a test of public confidence. I  am not going to tell the DUP or any other unionist party its business. I accept  that the DUP should know, much better than the likes of me, the nature and the  mind of unionism. However, when it comes to clause 2 and the public  declarations that have been made about who would or would not be acceptable,  according to party affiliation, as justice Minister, I have two things to say  to Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We understand and acknowledge why some Members from some  parties would find it difficult to endorse a candidate from another party. We  all carry baggage &mdash; emotions and fears from the past &mdash; and I will not diminish  or deny that fact. The SDLP held an event in west Belfast last night that was relevant to the past.  Alan McBride spoke at it. One cannot listen to him without realising how he  learned from his pain and gained wisdom on how to engage with other  communities, even though he still finds it difficult to have sympathy for some  of the people who may have been involved in the circumstances that led to his  wife&rsquo;s death. Like him, none of us should deny or diminish the fact that people  will have doubts, hesitations, concerns or even fears about who may become  justice Minister.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP has reached a point in its political development  at which it can see more than the principle of d&rsquo;Hondt governing what party  receives the ministerial portfolio. The SDLP has such levels of confidence  that, whatever party takes up the justice portfolio from those entitled to it  under the principles of democratic inclusion, it believes that the Minister  will be competent and balanced. There are plenty of checks and balances in the  Assembly and the Executive. At this morning&rsquo;s Assembly and Executive Review  Committee meeting &mdash; I am not talking out of turn by saying this &mdash; the First  Minister mentioned some of the additional checks and balances that might be  needed to govern how a Minister of justice would conduct his or her affairs.  There may be a point in that.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I remind the Member that the meeting to which  he referred was a private meeting. I seek your guidance on that, Mr Speaker.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  It is important that, as far as possible, private Committee meetings on ongoing  matters stay private.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I did not breach that convention too badly, given that the Assembly and  Executive Review Committee has spent quite some time discussing the  entitlements of a justice Minister and how some difficult, sensitive and urgent  matters might be handled. That is germane to the business of the Committee, and  my passing reference, in the context of this morning&rsquo;s meeting, did not stray  too far from the agreed confi&shy;dentiality. I accept your ruling, Mr Speaker, but  I did not offend too badly.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP has reached a point in its development at which,  regardless of personal views or political reservations, it accepts that whoever  becomes justice Minister will be competent and balanced. Regardless of doubts  in parties, we like to think that the wider community, including our community,  has reached that point. That is why we support the principle of d&rsquo;Hondt and why  we support the principle that a person from any party, regardless of any  reservations, is entitled to be put forward for the post. However, mindful of  that wider context and principle, we find it very difficult to accept that the  First Minister can declare that an SDLP candidate for justice Minister would  not be acceptable. Some people may regard someone from a certain background as  an unacceptable candidate for justice Minister. However, over and above the  fact that the eleventh Ministry should, under the rules of democratic  inclusion, fall to the SDLP and although we resent the breaching of that  principle in clause 2, we do not believe that broad swathes of unionism  continue to harbour such doubts and fear about an SDLP candidate for justice  Minister.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">What was the SDLP doing during all its years in the  district policing partnerships? We were demonstrating, in a way that we had not  fully done before, our view on the future and nature of policing and expressing  our support for and confidence in policing. The SDLP took risks for policing,  as it had previously taken risks for peace. How has that contribution over the  past seven or eight years resulted in a situation in which a member of our  party is disqualified from the role of justice Minister? The SDLP is, in so  many ways, a party with integrity and principles and one that has stretched  itself. Given that, why has one party in the Chamber said that, under clause 2  of the Bill, my party will not qualify to be considered favourably for the  justice Ministry?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My offence at clause 2 does not arise solely from the fact  that the Good Friday Agreement has been rewritten. Nor does it simply arise  because d&rsquo;Hondt has been abandoned, because democratic inclusion has been  jettisoned or because guarantees on how we conduct our political affairs have  been sidelined. I am concerned at how casually and willingly those matters seem  to have been signed off by the party to my right.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I will give way in a second.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That approach leads to a situation where a party, under  democratic inclusion, is denied its entitlement to a Ministry in the  Government, whatever that Ministry may be. My party has tried to behave  responsibly; nobody can deny that, regardless of our differences on policing  and justice matters or our appetite for reform and change, which may be greater  than others&rsquo;. I do not understand how the First Minister can say that because  Sinn F&eacute;in will stop a unionist gaining the justice Ministry, the DUP must stop  a nationalist doing so. Would it not be a measure and recognition of how far  the nationalist community has travelled in the past 10 years, having already  travelled a long road in preceding decades, for the First Minister to make a  bigger, braver and more courageous statement, rather than using clause 2 of the  Bill to say, &ldquo;Because we will not get our one, you will not get yours&rdquo;? Is that  the level of political debate, discourse and insight that we are at?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Those are some broader reasons why we will oppose the  Question that clause 2 stand part of the Bill. We recognise the areas in which  the First Minister has stretched himself and demonstrated good leadership and  good authority. We do not like the terms of the devolution of justice; we  believe that they are substan&shy;tially, if not exclusively, in the image of the  DUP&rsquo;s needs. We again warn the British Government that unpicking the  institutions and elements that have created cohesion and stability in our  society &mdash; the Good Friday Agreement provisions, the parades provisions and the  Patten provisions &mdash; as part of a broader approach and strategy is not the way  to deepen stability. However, that is what clause 2 does.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The First Minister may be looking to the unionist community  and perhaps particular elements of it to decide what to do next. The bravest  step that he could take would be to say that we need devolution of justice now,  because it will deepen confidence in our institutions and deal with the issues  that affect so many unionist and nationalist communities that are at risk. He  should go further and define the new order of things and differentiate it from  the fog that surrounded the previous months and weeks and all the difficulties  with a shared future, the workings of the North/South institutions and other  unresolved issues in government. The DUP should say that it will clear all that  fog. It should also say that nationalism has an entitlement under the  provisions of democratic inclusion. Further&shy;more, if that party insists on the  cross-community support mechanism for the selection of a justice Minister, the  SDLP candidate should be endorsed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you, the Speaker and Members for  your indulgence today and over the past while.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Chairperson of the Committee for the Office of the  First Minister and deputy First Minister (Mr <strong>Kennedy)</strong>: Although I am the Chairperson of the Committee for the  Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister, which is the Department  that has responsibility for the Bill, I am also a member of the Assembly and  Executive Review Committee, and I intend to make some remarks in a party  political capacity.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will refer to the first group of amendments and mention  briefly the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy First  Minister&rsquo;s scrutiny of the Bill. The Committee received a pre-introductory briefing  from departmental officials on 9 September 2009. A public notice was placed in  the &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo;, &lsquo;The Irish News&rsquo; and the &lsquo;News Letter&rsquo; on 18 September  2009 seeking written evidence on the Bill.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill was referred to the Committee on completion of its  Second Stage on 22 September 2009, and, in response to its call for evidence,  the Committee received written submissions from the Assembly and Executive  Review Committee and a late submission from Mr Jim Allister QC, leader of  Traditional Unionist Voice. The Committee considered the Bill and the  submission from the Assembly and Executive Review Committee on 7 October 2009.  We discussed and noted the late written submission from Mr Jim Allister QC on  14 October 2009 and agreed to include that submission in the Committee&rsquo;s  report.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee undertook its formal clause-by-clause  scrutiny of the Bill on 14 October 2009. I will now relate the outcome of that  scrutiny. The Committee agreed that it was content with clause 1 and the relevant  schedule as drafted. The Committee considered clause 2, and Mr Elliott proposed  that the Committee seek advice from the Assembly&rsquo;s Legal Services about the  potential consequences of the sunset clause. The Committee divided on Mr  Elliott&rsquo;s proposal, which fell. Mr Attwood proposed to leave out clause 2; the  Committee divided on Mr Attwood&rsquo;s proposal, which also fell. The Question was  put that the Committee was content with clause 2 as drafted; the Committee  divided on the Question, which was agreed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee considered clause 3, and Mr Attwood proposed  an amendment to clause 3(2) to replace the words:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&nbsp;&ldquo;such day or  days as the First Minister and deputy First Minister, acting jointly, may by  order appoint.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">with the date &ldquo;7 December 2009.&rdquo; The Committee  divided on the proposed amendment, which fell. The Question was put that the  Committee was content with clause 3 as drafted; the Committee divided on the  Question, which was agreed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That is the entirely factual description of the positions  that the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy First  Minister took on the Bill. I will now make some brief remarks &mdash; they will be  substantially briefer than the previous contribution &mdash; on behalf of the Ulster  Unionist Party.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">2.30 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is an &lsquo;Alice  in Wonderland&rsquo; feel to aspects of the proceedings today. The amendments in  group 1 concern the appointment of a justice Minister, a role known in this  House, in past decades, as the Minister of Home Affairs. A new process for the  appointment of such a Minister has now been devised by the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in.  The political circumstances surrounding this afternoon&rsquo;s debates are well  known, and I suspect that, although none of us are prophets or sons of  prophets, we have a sense of what the various outcomes will be.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Northern Ireland Office is busily talking to party  leaders and various representatives, saying that the Assembly must urgently  agree to the Bill because policing and justice powers must be devolved quickly.  In remarks made from the United    States, the First Minister said that the  confidence now exists to devolve policing and justice. The Minister of Finance  and Personnel has declared that the devolution of policing and justice should  happen sooner rather than later, and the former junior Minister Mr Donaldson  said yesterday that the retention of the full-time Reserve was a deal-breaker.  He said that policing and justice would not be devolved without that retention.  Such words imply that the context that we are in is one in which the DUP and  Sinn F&eacute;in are talking about the possible imminent devolution of policing and  justice. I see that you are taking advice, Mr Speaker.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The leader of Sinn F&eacute;in, Mr Adams, has said that the  British Government and the DUP must now implement their commitments under the  St Andrews Agreement to speedily devolve policing and justice powers. Despite  that, during the Bill&rsquo;s Second Stage, the DUP&rsquo;s Rev Dr William McCrea &mdash; I am  sorry that he is not in his place &mdash; informed us that this was make believe. He  said that we should all vote for the Bill, because:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Bill does not  say that the devolution of policing and justice powers is imminent.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Bill does not do  that.&rdquo; &mdash; <span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official  Report, Vol 43, No 4, p206, col 2].</span></p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Bill does not  hasten by one hour the day of devolution of justice and policing powers. &mdash; <span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official Report, Vol 43,  No 4, p207, col 1].</span></p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Where does that leave the amendments in group 1? Do they  address a situation that will be faced by the Assembly in the immediate future,  or is this an abstract debate over constitutional niceties that are not to be  faced any time soon? We need an answer to that question if Members are to have  an informed debate on the tabled amendments. I am prepared for an intervention  from the deputy First Minister, who will respond to the debate, or the First  Minister, who is no longer in his place, to clarify the position that they both  hold.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I believe in devolution, and I come from a party that  believes in devolution. We are more than happy to contemplate the return of  policing and justice powers to this House. After all, the Ulster Unionist Party  exercised such powers in this House for a considerable period. I want the  process of devolution of those powers to be done properly. Those powers are too  fundamental to the well-being and security of the entire community to be shoved  through without consensus.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The division at Second Stage showed the lack of consensus  on the mechanisms proposed in the Bill. The amendments in group 1, tabled by  the SDLP, also emphasise that lack of agreement on the mechanics for the  appointment of a justice Minister. A particularly important provision of the  new clause 2A, as proposed in amendment No 2, is the responsibility that it  would place on the First Minister and deputy First Minister to explain to the  House the consequences of the sunset clause.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Even if the parties of the First Minister and the deputy  First Minister vote down the proposed new clause 2A, surely they have a  responsibility to explain to the House what will happen if the Bill is passed  without amendment, and the sunset clause is invoked on 1 May 2012. The list of  matters referred to in proposed new clause 2A(b) are not prescriptive. The clause  refers to:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the consequences of  such dissolution for the exercise of the functions that the Department of  Justice is to exercise&rdquo;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText" style="text-indent:0cm;">The deputy First Minister must  explain to the House what those consequences will be.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland has been here before. In 1972,  circumstances undermined the stability and the integrity of the Northern  Ireland Parliament, and that had a grievous impact on the stability of our  society. Therefore, the following question is legitimate and necessary: what  will happen if the sunset clause is invoked on 1 May 2012? I cannot imagine how  Members can vote against amendment No 2 without having been given a  satisfactory answer to that question.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 2 also makes provision for a Minister of  justice to be appointed under the d&rsquo;Hondt system if the report of the First  Minister and deputy First Minister proposed by the amendment is not endorsed by  the Assembly. The d&rsquo;Hondt system should be rerun in full to appoint a Minister  of justice. The Minister of justice should be appointed on the same basis as  his or her ministerial colleagues. If the community confidence exists to  devolve policing and justice, that should be the manner in which a Minister is  appointed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My colleagues and I will join the SDLP to vote against the  DUP/Sinn F&eacute;in arrangement to appoint a Minister of justice outside the normal  procedures of the House. The DUP/Sinn F&eacute;in arrangement to appoint, potentially,  a puppet Minister demeans the administration of justice and the significance of  policing. Only yesterday, in &lsquo;The Irish News&rsquo;, the Alliance Party&rsquo;s Dr Farry  stated that a Minister of justice who had been appointed according to the  unamended provisions of the Bill would have little integrity or authority. He  said:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;As things stand the  legislation suggests that &hellip; under a political whim the DUP and SF could reach a  conclusion they want to remove a minister from office. If a Minister is looking  over a shoulder then their ability to take those decisions is going to be  significantly impaired.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: We  all agree that a Minister of justice must not be a puppet Minister. In the  light of the need to avoid that situation, will Mr Kennedy give an assurance  that his party is willing to engage with all the other parties to agree a  policy programme in advance of the devolution of policing and justice, perhaps  as an addendum to the Programme for Government? That would ensure that a  Minister of justice can deliver a programme on behalf of the people of Northern Ireland  and the House.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister</strong>:  A considerable flaw in the process has been the lack of consultation and  meaningful dialogue with other parties in the House and in the Executive. Clear  lessons should be learned from the reasons why we are unhappy with the  provisions of the legislation and why we are cynical and sceptical about  engagement with the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in. Like other parties, we are ready to  engage. However, that engagement must be serious and go even further than what  Dr Farry outlined. Engagement must address how the Executive behave in looking  after the work of the Assembly and the affairs of the people of Northern Ireland.  A fundamental change must be made to the dysfunctional way in which Executive  business is carried out in this place.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  appreciate the Member giving way. Given that he places so much emphasis on the  importance of parties discussing these various issues, will he, as deputy  leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, encourage his party leader to respond to  the letter that I wrote in August?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister</strong>:  That is a very helpful suggestion, and I will raise the matter with Sir Reg  Empey. I have no doubt that he will give it urgent consideration. I am not sure  how that letter was signed, perhaps as the possible justice Minister designate  or something like that, but we will certainly &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: He  signed it as the leader of the Alliance Party.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister</strong>:  Well, we will consider it and provide a full, detailed reply.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In general, the Ulster Unionist Party supports what the  SDLP is attempting to do today with the amendments. However, that support is  qualified. Although we seek the clarity that the SDLP seeks, and we want the  d&rsquo;Hondt system to be run in full sequence, we will not be bound by any  artificial time frame for the devolution of policing and justice. Therefore, we  cannot and will not support any amendments that place a specific deadline or  timetable on events.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My party colleagues will address other matters associated  with the amendments in this group. At this stage, I signify that the Ulster  Unionist Party is minded to support the opposition to clause 2 and to support  amendment No 2.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  I will address the specific point of the election of the Minister for the new  Department of justice. The topic has produced much discussion, but it is a  relatively simple concept for Members to understand.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is straightforward. Clause 2 sets out a process  for the appointment of a Minister of justice by vote of the Assembly. I point  out that the process of appointing a justice Minister, whenever that occurs,  will be an inclusive, full-blown Assembly process that ensures every Member&rsquo;s  involvement. The proposed method is not unfamiliar to Members. Indeed, it is  used for critical votes in the Assembly; and the Speaker is elected according  to the method. Therefore, d&rsquo;Hondt is not the only process used by the Assembly.  Surely, the appointment of a policing and justice Minister is so important that  it must have cross-community support. We will then have a Minister who has  support that is drawn from both sections of the community, which is essential.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The position is of great importance and sensitivity.  Therefore, every possible means to demonstrate cross-party support and to  ensure that the person who is appointed has the confidence of the widespread  community must be taken. The system that I want to see will ensure that both  sections of our community support the new justice Minister. The proposed method  of electing the new Minister requires not only a majority of Members of the  Assembly to endorse the appointment; it must be further endorsed by a majority  of nationalist Members and a majority of unionist Members.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That approach sends out a strong message because a  cross-community vote demonstrates that all sections of the House have given  their agreement. Unanimous support from the Chamber also sends out an important  signal of legitimacy for any Minister. Some Members have complained, today and  previously, about clause 2, but their argument is flawed. The arrangements in  the Bill for appointing a Minister of justice are clearly different from those  that are used to appoint other Executive Ministers. Members who complain must  realise that what was negotiated as part of the Belfast Agreement was rewritten  in the St Andrews Agreement. That ensured that the DUP had a veto over when the  devolution of policing and justice powers would take place. It is obvious that  that is far from agreed at present. The party also ensured a veto over who the  Minister would be. Sinn F&eacute;in conceded that veto to the DUP.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">With those points in mind, I support the Bill.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I understand that this debate may be  suspended at 3.00 pm. I am in your hands about whether you want me to continue  or you wish to break.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  We will run the debate very close to 3.00 pm. I will then interrupt you and  allow you to finish after Question Time.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Speaker. I am sure that you will not be the only one to interrupt  me this afternoon.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">What we have heard so far amounts to an attempt to rerun  debates that we have had in the House recently and, periodically, on the  airwaves. Absolutely nothing additional has been contributed to the debate, so  we have learned nothing new. I note that people spend their time saying that  what we are doing is wrong, and why we should not be doing it, but nobody ever  comes up with any alternative. That has been made clear and confirmed by the  previous contributors, including Danny Kennedy.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP and the UUP often operate in the Assembly by  presenting themselves almost as leaders of the opposition. However, on the very  important issue of timing, which is crucial to the SDLP amendments, it is clear  that those two parties cannot agree on an essential element of the transfer of  policing and justice powers. At least one of those parties, which keep telling  everyone what we are doing wrong, should let the public know its alternative.  Those parties need not worry about informing the House, because they have not  done so yet, but they should tell the public how they might secure the transfer  of policing and justice powers, which they say that they want to achieve.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">At no time during the lifetime of the first Executive, when  the Ulster Unionist Party and the SDLP occupied the positions of First Minister  and deputy First Minister, did they propose the establishment of a Department  of justice, or anything like it. The issue did not arise then, so parties that  claim that they have been pursuing the issue for years have never demonstrated  their intention by putting forward a proposal. Furthermore, although the party  that tabled the amendments tells us that it wants to behave responsibly, it has  taken every opportunity to denounce the Bill and vote against its provisions.  That, as we have witnessed, extends to the party&rsquo;s participation at Westminster, where its  Members variously voted for, abstained or did not turn up for votes on a  policing Bill. On one occasion, the SDLP voted for the Bill, on others it voted  against or abstained. I am not saying whether the party was right or wrong in  any of those actions; I am merely pointing out that there are many  contradictions in the position of the party that tabled the amendments.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  The Member refers to votes against and for the policing Bill at Westminster. The vote  cast for the policing Bill by the SDLP at Westminster  was at Second Reading, when the only Members who voted against were those who  opposed the Patten plan. As a party that backed the Patten plan, which required  legislation, the SDLP supported the Bill at Second Reading. We then tabled a  series of amendments and opposed the Government&rsquo;s later version of the Bill  because it did not match up with the Patten recomm&shy;endations. That is how  legislation is conducted, and the Member&rsquo;s party does exactly the same in this  House.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  The Member should not get too excited; it is a bit early in the debate to be  getting annoyed. I made the point that I was not contesting whether the  decision to vote for, against or abstain was right. During the legislative  process, people have the right to take various positions as they see fit. I  merely point out that, at the time, there were fundamental problems in getting  that Bill passed. It took a lot of hard work afterwards, and our party had to  fight an almost lone battle to rectify the Bill.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Notwithstanding all of that, we are here, in 2009,  essentially to respond to Members who have argued that they have done all the  work and carried the heavy burden for years by themselves. The point is that,  when they had the opportunity, in the roles of First Minister and deputy First  Minister, they never advocated the establishment of a Department of justice. As  the old saying goes, talk is cheap, but it takes money to buy drink.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There were recurring themes in Mr Attwood&rsquo;s contribution.  The fact that Mr Attwood and his party are simply going round the houses &mdash; the  long way round &mdash;on this matter was demonstrated this morning and this  afternoon, when he took a long time to tell us how &ldquo;on the one hand&rdquo;, in what I  thought was initially a negative tone in respect of the sunset clause, the  First Minister and the deputy First Minister should &ldquo;explain&rdquo; and &ldquo;come clean&rdquo;  about what will happen if we reach May 2012 without making provision for a  Department of justice.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Attwood contends, and his party colleagues often repeat,  that, by design or default, alternative arrangements are in place and the  sunset clause is meaningless. At the other end of the spectrum, Mr Attwood went  on to say that our failure to make provision for 2012 and the fact that there  is no fallback position means that we face grave and catastrophic consequences.  He cannot have it both ways: either there is a fallback position, whether by  design or default, or there is no provision for 2012.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that the First Minister and the deputy First  Minister will deal with this point; but, certainly, from Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s point of  view, the arrangements that OFMDFM has reached with Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP thus  far have resulted in the Bill, which is important, necessary and enabling  legislation, being tabled. The essence of the Bill is that we have an  arrangement that, although it may not be perfect, will facilitate the transfer  of policing and justice powers, if and when we can agree a time frame for it to  happen.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have no hesitation in, or reservations about, saying that  Sinn F&eacute;in has relentlessly pursued this matter. Why have the media and the  airwaves been full of controversy in recent days? Why were Martin McGuinness  and Peter Robinson with the British Prime Minister last Saturday? It is because  we are relentlessly attempting to secure the establishment of a Department of  justice, and we make no apologies for that pursuit. The fact that we do not  have it yet is hardly breaking news; it is a work in progress, and everyone is  aware that we are reaching a point at which there are difficulties beyond even  policing and justice. However, that is a discussion for another day. I am  merely making the point that we are relentlessly pursuing an agreed time frame  in which to establish a Department of justice.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill provides that, when we reach that point, the  legislation that is required to establish the Department will be in place and,  therefore, we will not face undue delays in having a Department with the  appropriate policing and justice responsibilities that functions fully and  benefits the interests of the wider public. The sunset clause is important and  necessary, because it means that, once a Department is established, there will  be an imperative on the parties, as my colleague John O&rsquo;Dowd said, to learn  from what I hope will be a positive experience, and that will enable us to  agree a more permanent structure for the Department of justice by May 2012.  Those discussions will then reach their own conclusions.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I look forward to the Department being established, and  then we can live and learn lessons from our experiences as we work through to  2012. However, let me make it clear, there are no fallback arrangements for  2012, if the Assembly has not put in place or agreed any alternative measures.  The British Government&rsquo;s representative in Westminster, Paul Goggins, addressed that  matter when responding to Mark Durkan in the debate to pass the relevant  legislation. He stressed at length that, as far as the British Government are  concerned, there is no fallback position and it is not their job to provide  one.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We all know that the world will not end in May 2012, so  something will have to happen. Sinn F&eacute;in is working on the basis that, if we  can establish a Department, people will find it beneficial that locally elected  representatives will, for the first time, be accountable for those crucial  powers and functions. Having gained experience between the time when the  Department is established and May 2012, we will be able to come to a rational,  mature decision on how to proceed from that date.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Speaker, were you about to intervene?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  No. Carry on.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  Thank you. The purpose of the sunset clause is clear: to ensure that all our  minds are concentrated before May 2012 so that we can take forward the work of  an already transferred Department on a rational, sound and permanent basis. For  my party, that implies that, in the wider scheme of things, the Department  should be established under d&rsquo;Hondt, and so on. The Bill provides for a  temporary or interim arrangement among OFMDFM, Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP. That the  arrangement is temporary is demonstrated by the fact that, in May 2012, a  sunset clause will kick in, and there is no fallback position. That stresses  the need to agree a more permanent basis upon which the new Department of  justice can proceed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I turn to the amendments, which Sinn F&eacute;in opposes. A number  of them are consequential amendments, and I do not intend to devote any time to  those. The issue of a &ldquo;designated day&rdquo; shows that people are trying to set a  time frame on the process. I have already referred to the fact that Sinn F&eacute;in  and others are working to resolve the question of a time frame. No amendment or  proposal made in this debate can compel any party that has not yet agreed to  the transfer of powers to co-operate on that, particularly if it is the largest  party in its respective designation. Those amendments are meaningless because  they cannot compel anyone to fulfil the intention behind them.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I turn to the question of the d&rsquo;Hondt process and what the  SDLP regards as its entitlement. It argues that the Department of justice will  be the eleventh Department and that because the SDLP comes next in the d&rsquo;Hondt  running order, the Department should fall automatically to that party. Mr  Attwood referred to the rules of d&rsquo;Hondt and the additional Department.  However, there are no rules and no provisions for 11 Departments. We will have  to create rules and provisions for an eleventh Department. To do that, d&rsquo;Hondt  must be run from one to 11. No one can seriously suggest &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>A Member</strong>:  Why not do that?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  I have no difficulty with that. However, there are no rules under which that  can be done at present, so we must agree them. I invite other parties, instead  of telling us what we are doing wrong, to tell us how they would do it  differently, and with whom. We have heard already from Mr Kennedy that the  Ulster Unionist Party does not agree with the SDLP on the issue of timing.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  The Member suggests that there is no provision for more than 10 Departments.  Under the Good Friday Agreement, the provision is that, if there are to be more  than 10 Departments, the consent of the Secretary of State is required.  Elsewhere in the agreement, it is clearly stated that government Departments in  Northern Ireland  must be headed by a Minister appointed through the d&rsquo;Hondt system. That is what  the agreement and the 1998 Act provide for. This Bill is a departure from that,  and the Member is trying to create a fiction and a smokescreen to obscure that.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. I must interrupt the debate for Question Time, after which I will allow  Mr Maskey to continue. The House may take its ease for a few moments.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The debate stood suspended.</p>

      <p class="OralWrittenAnswersHeading"><a name="3"></a>Oral Answers to Questions</p>
      <p class="H3SectionHeading">Finance and Personnel</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I see no Minister here to take questions.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Minister is in his place.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Social Housing: Credit Unions</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr F  McCann </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel if he has discussed  within the Executive the credit unions&rsquo; proposal to open up discussions  regarding the investing of their funds in social housing programmes.<em><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></em>(AQO  348/10<a name="AQO34810"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr S Wilson)</strong>: I am glad that at least you recognised  that I was in the House, Mr Speaker. I know a good optician that Mr O&rsquo;Loan can  use so that he can see me in future. I do not think that I have been called the  invisible Minister before; this is a first.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Housing policy is an issue for the Minister for Social  Development, and I would expect her to raise any proposal for the funding of  social housing by credit unions. I understand that she has already met the  credit unions, but, to date, she has not made any approach to my Department  about funding from that source.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that given the shortage of finance for the housing  issue, and the lack of any strategy from the Minister for Social Development to  deal with the problem, the financial resources held by credit unions could  transform the social housing sector?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: As I have already mentioned, this really is a matter  for the Minister for Social Development. Housing associations can seek funding  from whatever sources they wish; currently, approximately 67% of housing  association funding for social housing comes from private sources. If the  housing associations want to follow up on the possibility of funding from the  credit unions, or any other financial institution, they are free to do so.  Within certain rules, they are free to finance housing stock from that source.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  The Minister will recognise that the future financing of social housing in Northern Ireland  is a big issue, and Mr McCann&rsquo;s question, the Housing Council and the Northern  Ireland Housing Commission have all talked about the issue. There are dozens of  different ideas, many of which could ease pressure on the public purse. Does  the Minister agree that to get a better assessment of the validity and feasibility  of those ideas, a review of social housing in Northern Ireland &mdash; one which  particularly examines placing social housing delivery on a firm foundation in  difficult economic times &mdash; would be a good proposal?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I understand the importance of investment in social  housing, particularly as private sector house building has taken a knock, and  that has impacted on the construction industry. The social housing sector is  important. However, any review of the finance or structure of social housing is  ultimately the respons&shy;ibility of the Minister for Social Development, and she  should be the first port of call on that issue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There have sometimes been difficulties with the Department  for Social Development&rsquo;s finances and looking at innovative ways of using  finance. Therefore, my departmental officials would be more than happy to help  with any such review and give the Department some pointers.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  welcome the Minister to Question Time.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As Mr Hamilton rightly said, there is a lot of novel  thinking going on about funding for social housing. I understand what the  Minister has said about the responsibility of the Minister for Social  Development in that area, but clearly there are also serious financial issues.  Therefore, I urge the Minister to go further than he has done in his  contribution and say what his Department has done in researching the issue and  what novel forms of funding his Department could bring to the table.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. I hope that I  am not treading on the Minister for Social Development&rsquo;s toes, but I have  already met a number of people who are interested in bringing private finance  to the social housing sector. The sources of that funding range from the  construction industry to pension funds, and I have looked at how that finance  might be innovatively used. I know that some of them have spoken to the  Minister for Social Development, too.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Finance and Personnel can help in a  number of ways. First, once we go down the route of looking at innovative  proposals, procurement issues will be involved, and some of those will be  complex: the Department can bring its expertise to bear. Secondly, there is no  point in looking for innovative sources of finance if finding them has an  impact on the block grant. Again, the Department can provide advice and  expertise on how any such finance might affect the Treasury&rsquo;s view of money  that it already gives to Northern    Ireland and whether the method of finance  involved is likely to have an impact on the block grant.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Thirdly, the Department of Finance and Personnel can help  with the economic evaluation of such schemes. I looked at one scheme and met  representatives of the pension fund. Such schemes are very often complex and  will have long-term implications for housing association and social housing  revenue, and my officials can evaluate the longer-term aspects.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Civil Service: Recruitment and Overtime</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr Beggs </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel which Departments and agencies  have recently introduced a recruitment freeze, or a policy to cut or reduce  overtime.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 349/10<a name="AQO34910"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Due to financial pressures, the Department of  Finance and Personnel, the Department of the Environment, the Department for  Regional Development and the Department for Employment and Learning introduced  a temporary freeze on recruitment, promotion and non-essential overtime to  allow them to consider their financial positions in light of budgetary  constraints.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his answer. Recruitment freezes are much more preferable  to the costly alternative of redundancies. Does the Minister agree that  recruitment freezes can expose areas of need and work required due to staff  being in the wrong place; and will he acknowledge that his late acceptance of a  financial black hole may well have contributed to the problem, and that this  matter should have been addressed earlier?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I wondered how long it would be before the black  hole appeared. There are more black holes in the Assembly than there are holes  in Cromac Street. <em>[Interruption.]</em></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: There are limitations to the use of recruitment freezes.  Although those four Departments introduced a freeze, it was for a very short  time in order to allow them to consider their financial positions. Departments  might well look at the use of temporary agency staff, overtime bans,  recruitment freezes and redeployment. Therefore, there are a number of ways to  deal with this matter. Financial pressures will inevitably come, and Mr Beggs  will, I am sure, know from the discussions which his party has had with its new  allies that they might be even greater than at present. We will have to manage  that, which will mean managing the number of staff used by Departments.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>:  The hole in Cromac Street  will be filled in by the end of the week. Will the number of people employed in  the Civil Service decrease in light of those recruitment freezes?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The number of Civil Service posts was reduced by  almost 2,000 in the past 18 months. That was not entirely as a result of  recruitment freezes, but was also due to people leaving and their posts not  being filled. It was also decided that some posts, including some in my  Department, would no longer be held, and they will, therefore, not be filled  when they become vacant.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We envisage that there will be a further reduction of 2,000  to 2,500 people in the Civil Service between now and 2012.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Regional Economic Strategy</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr  Neeson </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel for an update on the  status of the Regional Economic Strategy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  350/10<a name="AQO35010"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The need to produce a regional economic strategy is  a legacy of direct rule, during which Her Majesty&rsquo;s Treasury made it a  requirement on all the devolved Administrations throughout the UK to produce  such a strategy. The issue has changed considerably since then, because the  economic strategy for Northern    Ireland is now contained in the Programme  for Government, which has placed the promotion of the economy and economic  growth at the centre of our activities, policies and spending although, in  light of economic and fiscal changes, the Executive need to, and do, constantly  assess the policies.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is, however, an underlying, long-term vision for the  local economy, which is that we should have an innovative and dynamic economy  that is founded on a number of bases, such as strong productivity growth that  is driven by high-value-added human skills, as well as research and  development. That vision is reflected in the original draft regional economic  strategy, but it is central to the Programme for Government. The latest report  by Professor Barnett reinforced the need to continue to pursue those  objectives, if we are to have a thriving economy for the future.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I call Mr McLaughlin for a supplementary question.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>:  Mr Speaker.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  My apologies, Mr Neeson. I call Sean Neeson for a supplementary question.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>: I  heard what the Minister said, but does he recognise that the lack of an  economic strategy limits what the Executive can do in relation to rebalancing  the economy? He mentioned the Barnett review; will that not be constrained  without the required overarching strategic policy?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I hope that I have made it clear to the Member that  our economic strategy is now embedded in what we do, as decided by the Assembly  when it voted in support of the Programme for Government. The Programme for  Government does not only state the overall strategic objective of growing the  economy through the targets and policies that are highlighted within it; it  indicates the means of measuring whether we are achieving those targets.  Therefore, I do not think that Professor Barnett&rsquo;s report is hampered in the  way in which the Member has stated.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If anything, the Barnett report indicated that we were  doing many things right, although it also stated that there was a number of  things that we should do differently, and those will be consulted on by the  Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment. For instance, we should, perhaps,  move away from providing selective financial assistance to firms and look  towards spending more money on human skills and research and development, as I  mentioned. That will have to be looked at by the Assembly and the Minister.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Given the number of jobs that have  spilled out of the economy as a result of the economic downturn, does the  Minister still believe that the targets in relation to the economically  inactive, as set out in the regional economic strategy, can be achieved by  2015?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: We do not know what will happen or how quickly the  economy will turn around between now and 2015.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Some of the targets that we have set ourselves in the short  term will not be met due to circumstances beyond our control. However, the  longer-term goals are worth meeting. We must get people onto the employment  list and into jobs if we are to give them a stake in society and improve their  economic and physical well-being. The Assembly and the Executive will be judged  on what they do for that most disadvantaged part of our society. Very often  those people are in long-term unemployment and we must target and address their  situation.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer so far. Does he concede that the regional  economic strategy, along with that other embedded historic relic, the Programme  for Government, needs to be revised to take account of the contraction in the  economy, the doubling of unemployment, the public expenditure cuts that he now  proposes and the inevitable black hole in public finances that he expects me to  mention and which he has now been forced to admit, all of which, apparently,  are endorsed in today&rsquo;s report &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Will the Member conclude his question?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  &mdash; the Economic Eye winter forecast by Ernst and Young and Oxford Economics?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I know that Mr O&rsquo;Loan has difficulty with his eyes,  and perhaps Mr McNarry has difficulty with his ears, because I do not know at  what stage I admitted to there being a black hole. Nevertheless, if the Hansard  report turns that up, I will be more than happy to concede the point.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText"><em>[Interruption.]</em></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: However, I do not think that I made any such  admission today.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to the economic strategy responding to  different economic circumstances, I have made it clear already that it must do  that, and the actions of the Executive show that we are already doing that. For  example, in its report this week the construction industry indicated that,  since 2007, there has been an increase of 80% in the index of infrastructural  programmes being accounted for in the construction industry. In fact, 54% of  all construction activity is financed through the Assembly, and that is the  result of a decision made by my predecessor to increase the amount of money  spent on infrastructure and investment by &pound;1 million each day in the past year.  It is a result of the redirecting of the activity of the Executive to respond  to the circumstances that we faced.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Rates (Amendment) Act (Northern Ireland) 2009 was passed  recently, which gives business rates relief to 16,000 small businesses. That  means that we must redirect money from something else because the cost of that  relief will be about &pound;10 million. However, we are redirecting that money  because we saw that there was a problem as a result of the economic  circumstances and that it needed to be dealt with. I accept that we need to  adjust and be fleet-footed, and perhaps we are not fleet-footed enough at  times, but there are examples of when the Executive and the Assembly have done  that already.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I remind Members not to use Question Time to make statements. Question Time is  an opportunity for Members to put questions to Ministers. The same happened  yesterday. In future, I will ask the Member to take his or her seat, and I will  move on to the next Member.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Speaker. I will try to be succinct.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister agree that people are confused about the  economic strategy? Although he is content that it is buried in the Programme  for Government, nobody is quite sure what it is. Would it not be useful to  extrapolate the situation and tell people specifically what it is? Does the  Minister not feel that it would be useful to amalgamate the three different  policy units? There is an economic policy unit in the Department of Finance and  Personnel, in the Office of the First Minister and the deputy First Minister,  and in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment. Surely someone  should be in charge. Three different units cannot be in charge.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I know that the Member has a difficult task ahead of  him in his bid for the leadership of his party. I hope that he has not put his  foot in it. The last part of his question represents a rather off-message  response.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I understood that as far as the SDLP was concerned, the  number of Ministries was almost sacrosanct and that to reduce that number would  be a betrayal of the Belfast Agreement. Perhaps a new leadership is coming  through, and perhaps that is the innovation that we will see from the potential  new leader. If that is the case, I welcome it, because I support the Member&rsquo;s  point. Margaret Ritchie put me up to that, by the way.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Professor Barnett also supports the Member in that view. He  talked about a Department of the economy, which would involve the amalgamation  of at least two Departments and the removal of the economic unit from the  Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister. I think that that would  be a sensible first step in the rationalisation of Government Departments, and  I thank the Member for his support.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Quangos</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr I  McCrea </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel to outline the total  annual operating costs for all unelected quangos.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 351/10<a name="AQO35110"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: In the 2008-09 financial year, the gross expenditure  of public bodies in Northern    Ireland was in the region of &pound;9&middot;7 billion.  That includes the costs of some significant providers of public services, such  as Northern Ireland Water, Translink, health and social services boards and  education and library boards. Members can see the details of those bodies in  the annual report that DFP will publish. A copy of that report will be placed  in the Assembly Library.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer. I am sure that the House will agree that  the figure of &pound;9&middot;7 million for the previous financial year is certainly excessive.  Will the Minister detail what mechanisms are in place for reviewing the number  of public bodies that exist?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: First, I should make it clear that I wish that it  had been only &pound;9&middot;7 million &mdash; we spent &pound;9&middot;7 billion. The mechanisms for  reviewing public bodies are, of course, the responsibility of each Minister and  their Departments. In the past year, there has been a reduction of eight of  those bodies &mdash; seven by the Minister of Health in the reorganisation of the Health  Service and one by the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure when he decided to  close one of the public bodies in his remit.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I thank the Minister for bringing us up to date on the amount of money that is  going through the quangos. However, although it is one thing to reduce quangos  and their power &mdash; and we would all agree with that &mdash; the impact of that loss of  spending power could be quite catastrophic to some of our local economies. Has  the Minister made any assessment of the impact that such a drop would have?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: First, there is not necessarily a connection between  reducing the number of quangos and reducing spending power. I will take health  as an example, given that I mentioned it to the Member earlier. In that case,  the question was whether we should redirect spending from one function to  another and whether there was a need for a public body, with all its  administrative attachments, if that money might be spent more effectively in  another way. Although some of the reductions will be for efficiency savings,  some of which have to go back as cash savings, much of it should be directed  toward making sure that we have not established bodies that we do not really  need, the spending on which could be better used in the Department in question  or in other Departments to provide more effective services. That is how I would  like Departments and Ministers to look at the matter.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer. He detailed a huge amount of money. Has he  or his Department taken any action to assess the effectiveness and value for  money of those quangos?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Again, it should be the role of Ministers &mdash; and when  I was in the Department of the Environment I regarded it as my role as Minister  there &mdash; to look at the bodies that are under their control and ask whether they  are effective, whether they could be amalgamated and whether they are still  serving a useful purpose.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers say all the time at Executive meetings that  certain responsibilities are theirs and that they do not want DFP to plunder  through their Departments. If Ministers do not consider how resources might be  used more efficiently, in a time of spending constraint, they will have to bear  the consequences. That has been the case in some Departments.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Public Sector Jobs</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr  Attwood </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel whether he will  continue to pursue the recommendations of the Bain report on the location of  public sector jobs, recognising the social and environmental value of these  proposals.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 352/10<a name="AQO35210"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The question of whether to pursue the  recommendations of the independent report on the relocation or location of  public sector jobs is a matter for the Executive. I wrote to Executive  colleagues at the end of September to say that I am keen for an early  discussion. However, we are all aware of the funding pressures that the Northern Ireland  block faces, and spending on the relocation of public sector jobs would require  funding from other services.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am coming to the conclusion that the cost of &pound;40 million  that Professor Bain identified for the pilot phase alone is simply not  affordable to proceed to implement the recommendations, nor, as the report  states, would it represent value for money. Therefore, although the Executive  will make the final decision, we must bear those points in mind.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  Earlier, the Minister referred to people who could not see or hear. He might  want to learn to listen a bit more, because Dr McDonnell&rsquo;s question was about  economic policy units and not about the number of Departments. I trust that he  will answer the question in writing in due course.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Whatever the arguments about the relocation of existing  public services, does the Minister agree that there are opportunities for the  Government&rsquo;s new or restructured public bodies, including a victims&rsquo; service, a  development corporation for Maze/Long Kesh, the Charity Commission and the  Business Services Organisation<span style="font-size:9.5pt; "> </span>to name but a few, to be located outside the Belfast region?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I suspected that that might be the tenor of the  Member&rsquo;s question. It is frightening to think of the number of new public  bodies that are being created in Northern Ireland. Before the Member  starts to talk about relocating jobs outside Belfast, perhaps his party and others should  ask themselves the same question: where does the example start? Before I came  to the Chamber, I asked someone to google the SDLP for me, because I am not  good at doing that myself. The SDLP leader lives in Londonderry, and the bulk  of SDLP councillors and representatives represent areas outside Belfast, but the SDLP  headquarters are at 121 Ormeau    Road, Belfast.  Before the Member starts to ask questions about public sector relocation and  location, perhaps his party should look at the location of its headquarters.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Often, there are good reasons for government bodies being  located in the capital city and close to the seat of government. However, I  take the Member&rsquo;s point. Relocation is one thing, but there may be  opportunities for looking at places outside Belfast in the case of new government bodies  that do not have relocation costs and do not involve relocation disturbances.  That would be the responsibility of the individual Ministers who are  responsible for the new bodies.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. Given that the Minister said that there are good reasons  for government bodies to be located in Belfast,  why are those bodies resistant to locating jobs in parts of Belfast,  such as west Belfast, which is one of the most  deprived areas of Belfast  and an area of disadvantage and need? That was set out in the report of the West Belfast and Greater Shankill Task Forces.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: First, relocation, whether outside or inside Belfast, will still carry  costs.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I must say to the Member that I really do not accept that  people cannot travel from west Belfast into the city centre, which is a journey  of a couple of miles, by good public transport, by bicycle or on foot. I cannot  accept that it is necessary to relocate offices to the end of someone&rsquo;s street.  Surely to goodness, Belfast  is a compact enough city for people from all areas to be able to reach jobs  that are located in the city centre.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. That concludes questions to the Minister of Finance and Personnel. The  House may take its ease until the debate on the Department of Justice Bill is  resumed.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. As a Member who has a hearing defect, I ask  you to give a ruling on the appropriateness of making references to people&rsquo;s  eyesight and hearing when answering questions.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Of course, as far as possible, Members should be sensitive to that issue, which  Mr Dallat has raised on a number of occasions. I ask the House to be mindful of  that.</p>

      <p class="H4StageHeading">Consideration Stage</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText"><em>Debate resumed:</em></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. We shall resume the debate on the Department of Justice Bill. I ask Mr  Alex Maskey to continue with his remarks.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I want to pick up briefly from where I  left off, which was the question of d&rsquo;Hondt and the SDLP&rsquo;s argument of its  entitlement to the justice Ministry, if it were established.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In an intervention, Mark Durkan said that his party could  go to the Secretary of State to seek provision for 11 Departments, and so on.  My argument, which is essentially different to his, is that there must be  agreement to go to the British Secretary of State to seek anything. Mr Durkan  presented his argument in such a way that suggested that people could go to the  Secretary of State to ask for anything. I invite him to seek that agreement.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  We can go to the Secretary of State.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  Mr Durkan made that point already, and I am responding to it. It is easy for  the Member to throw out a comment about being able to go to the Secretary of  State. However, he and his party have failed consistently to explain who they  will go with and who they will reach agreement with to do that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Clearly, they will not reach agreement on key issues with  the Ulster Unionist Party, for example. I do not know what other party the SDLP  would seek to reach agreement with. It does not appear to have been able to put  together a package that shows that it, or a collection of parties, could secure  a vote in the House and thereby go to the Secretary of State, or that it could  reach any other agreement for that matter. Therefore, the essential issue  remains that &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  Will the Member give way for clarification?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  I am sorry; I have taken some three interventions already. The Member will have  plenty of time later to clarify his position.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  And I will.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  He can all right. Talk is cheap, so the Member must clarify whom he would reach  agreement with to secure all those great and wonderful things that he wants.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to recap on a number of points. First, I want to  return to the sunset clause, which my party considers to be both a vital  protection and an opportunity. My party&rsquo;s intention is to establish a justice  Department for beyond 2012. I am sure that other parties are also committed to  that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If, during the intervening period between the justice  Department&rsquo;s establishment and 1 May 2012, the experience has been positive,  the sunset clause, which my party hopes will be agreed, offers the Assembly the  opportunity to consider what will occur beyond May 2012 in a positive, mature  and rational light and to establish a permanent justice Department that is fit  for purpose and that has all the necessary protections.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I look forward to that opportunity. I believe that the vast  majority of the public want that to happen in the positive light that I  described.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP keeps trying to hammer home its entitlement to the  Department of justice under d&rsquo;Hondt, but it has no such entitlement. There is  no provision for 11 Departments and, therefore, no provision to run d&rsquo;Hondt  from one to 11. If we were to secure 11 Departments, the essential argument  remains that d&rsquo;Hondt would be run from one to 11. Does anyone suggest that the  SDLP has the God-given right to take the eleventh Department and that all the  other parties would sit back and wait until they did?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>: <em>[Interruption.]</em></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  With respect, I have already taken numerous interventions.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. Let the Member finish.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  The SDLP&rsquo;s repeated position is that it has the right to the next Department.  It does not. If, as I wish would happen, 11 Departments were to be established  here this afternoon through running d&rsquo;Hondt, I would love, by 5.00 pm, to be  putting Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s hat into the ring for the justice Department. At least two  other parties are ahead of the SDLP in the queue, and they would have a serious  argument to make on their behalf.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in is determined to secure the transfer of policing  and justice powers and pursues that aim relentlessly. In the first instance,  powers should be transferred into the hands of elected representatives from  here. We like the idea of, and are totally committed to, d&rsquo;Hondt, but there  must be transitional arrangements. Sinn F&eacute;in was involved in negotiations,  although other parties, particularly the SDLP, seem to think that they were the  only ones involved. The SDLP must have been talking to itself in 1998 because,  from what it says, no one else was involved. Sinn F&eacute;in is wedded to the  necessity of power sharing.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Is it the ambition of the Member, or his party, to hold the Department of  justice at some stage?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  I thank the Member for his question. Why would any party with a mandate deny  itself the opportunity to take responsibility for any area of governance? I  presume that Mr Kennedy&rsquo;s party &mdash; the Ulster Unionist Party, UCUNF, or whatever  its name may be this afternoon &mdash; would consider taking any Department to which  its mandate secured it the right. I look forward to a time when all parties,  including mine, will have the opportunity to consider each Department before  deciding which to select under d&rsquo;Hondt.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The absolute inclusion of all parties is essential to the  political dispensation in which we are all involved, and that brings me to my  next point. Mr Attwood referred to the process of exclusion, but Sinn F&eacute;in is  committed to a process of inclusion. That is why there is a power-sharing  Executive: the parties in the Executive share power. The difficulty for the  SDLP is that it does not occupy a lead position in OFMDFM, but that is simply  the democratic outworking of the last election. That may change: who knows? As  the SDLP is not in a lead position, it falls to Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP to work  their way through the issues by showing leadership and working inclusively with  the other parties. Mr Durkan, the outgoing leader of the SDLP, is aware of  that. Sinn F&eacute;in and other parties have spoken with the SDLP about the issue,  and SDLP Members sit on the Assembly and Executive Review Committee.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  In trying to keep the discussion to the amendments and clause 2, I have shown  some latitude to all Members. However, I detect that some Members are straying  outside the amendments to the justice Bill and, specifically, at present,  support for, or opposition to, clause 2. I remind Members that, as far as  possible, they should keep to the subject of the debate, which is the  Department of Justice Bill.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for his reminder to Members; I will do my best to  honour that commitment. I do not wish to recap to ensure that I clarify all the  relevant points.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We support the sunset clause because it is very important,  and we clearly support clause 2 and the Bill as a whole because we are focused  on getting policing and justice powers transferred into the hands of locally  elected representatives. The arrangements in clause 2 are interim and  transitional, and that is verified and underscored by writing a sunset clause  into the Bill that will bring those arrangements to an end by May 2012. Sinn  F&eacute;in supports and will continue to support the Bill as it stands because we  believe that it represents the best efforts of people to ensure that powers are  transferred as soon as possible.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The time frame mentioned in some of the amend&shy;ments has  been dealt with earlier. It will come up again later, so I suppose that we can  deal with it then, too. As far as Sinn F&eacute;in is concerned, the Bill does not  require a time frame. Although some people want a time frame to be included,  the Bill is an essential piece of enabling legislation that does not require  one. The Bill needs to be passed sooner rather than later, because it is a  necessary element of devolution. People who argue, inside and outside the  House, in favour of powers being transferred must explain how voting against  the Bill and working actively against it will serve that need.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Our party supports the Bill, and we oppose the amendments  unapologetically in our relentless pursuit of having the powers of policing and  justice transferred to locally elected representatives as soon as possible.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: I  support the Bill and oppose the amendments. The devolution of policing and  justice is a positive step for Northern    Ireland. It brings potential benefits,  because it allows much closer collaboration and co-operation among the existing  Departments and the Executive on a range of issues relating to policing and  justice. My party believes that it should happen as soon as possible.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">However, we have never set artificial deadlines for the  process, because we recognise that the issue is sensitive in respect of  political and community sensibilities. We want our approach to be constructive  because we want people in the community to have genuine confidence &mdash; not the  kind of confidence that is about setting up a series of hurdles for people to  jump &mdash; in the House and in the Executive to competently and capably deliver on  the issues. We have tried to be constructive from our position outside the  Executive, and I am trying to do the same now.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to speak about the amendments and the picture  painted of them. First, as to whether clause 2 should stand part of the Bill,  the Alliance Party has never made any secret of the fact that it believes that  the Executive should not have been formed using the mechanism laid out in the  Good Friday Agreement. That was not our first choice, and we have been very  open and honest about that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We support moving from a mandatory coalition to a voluntary  coalition in which Members negotiate a Programme for Government and work  together on it. That would create a level of cohesion and co-operation in the  Executive and tie Members to a programme in a way that the mandatory coalition  has not done. We have been open and honest in saying that we would prefer that.  However, we respect the fact that some Members are not comfortable with that or  confident that it would work. Some view voluntary coalition as a mechanism to  exclude them, while others think that it is a mechanism that would benefit them  by excluding others. My party believes that voluntary coalition is not about  that; it is about trying to find a system that works.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We have made no apologies for the fact that we are not and  never have been wedded to d&rsquo;Hondt. We view it simply as a mechanism to deal  with proportionality. However, it is only one of many mechanisms that can do  that. It can be argued that, in many cases, it is not the best mechanism for  dealing with proportionality. The Good Friday principles underpinning the issue  are inclusion and proportionality, not d&rsquo;Hondt, and they can be achieved in a  range of ways. We are again in danger of making the mechanism the principle,  and that is a very foolish thing to do.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I aspire to the day when we no longer need the d&rsquo;Hondt  mechanism for any of our Ministries and when we can move away from the type of  mandatory coalition that we have currently. Therefore, I welcome any  opportunity to demonstrate how other mechanisms can deliver. I believe that the  Bill presents such an opportunity.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is not about who gets the job of justice Minister; it is  about how a person gets the job. The Bill provides a better mechanism for  electing a Minister than that which we use at present.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am not going to shed any tears if the person who is  appointed justice Minister is done so on the basis of a cross-community vote.  However, I am realistic enough to know that clause 2 is not some sort of Trojan  Horse by which we will be able to speed up getting voluntary coalitions into  the Assembly. Much as I would like to see that happen, and much as I wish that  that were the case, I do not believe that to be the reality. However, as  political fixes go, this is preferable to those that we have chosen in the  past. Therefore, I have no difficulty with clause 2 standing part of the Bill.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Alex Attwood talked about the rules of democratic  inclusion. However, which ones was he referring to? The d&rsquo;Hondt mechanism is  only one of many ways by which to achieve democratic inclusion. I find it quite  strange that when we talk about the rules of democratic inclusion, we talk  about it in those broad terms. The SDLP is wedded to the d&rsquo;Hondt process. It  amazes me that an obscure Belgian gets so much attention every time we debate  any issue in the Chamber.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The reality is that the SDLP has acknowledged that there  may be other, better means of inclusion. Through the Equality Commission, the  SDLP challenged Lisburn City Council for allegedly breaching equality rules  because it went beyond other inclusion mechanisms so that it could use d&rsquo;Hondt.  I do not disagree with the position that the SDLP has taken on that matter.  However, it raises the question that if other methods of inclusion are good  enough for other places, why is the SDLP so wedded to the d&rsquo;Hondt mechanism  when it comes to appointing a justice Minister? There is a contradiction in the  SDLP&rsquo;s position on the d&rsquo;Hondt process.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  The SDLP&rsquo;s concern is that clause 2 is a departure from the provisions of the  Northern Ireland Act 1998. Those provisions are based on the agreement. If  there is a review of the agreement, and if parties agree to a different form of  inclusion according to mandate &mdash; such as the Sainte-Lagu&#1105; method &mdash; that  mechanism will become the rule. However, the principle of the agreement remains  inclusion according to mandate. Clause 2 is a departure from inclusion  according to mandate and is a departure from the existing Act.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: I  will raise a number of issues in response to that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The first departure from the Good Friday Agreement is  having an extra Department. If we are to devolve policing and justice &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  It does not have to be an extra Department.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: If  we are to devolve policing and justice, it looks, at this stage, as though that  will require an extra Department. If we are to redraw the Departments, that is  another departure from the Good Friday Agreement. Furthermore &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  No, it is not.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  Furthermore, Mr Durkan specifically said that clause 2 would be a departure  from inclusion on the basis of mandate. However, nobody knows who the justice  Minister is going to be. There is no guarantee that it will not be someone who  is being included on the basis of mandate. Frankly, I think that people are  getting ahead of themselves in suggesting otherwise.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to deal with the issues on amendment Nos 2, 3 and 4.  I listened very carefully to Alex Attwood as he made the arguments in favour of  those amendments. He did two things. First, he emphasised the likelihood of  failure to agree a long-term solution by the deadline of 2012, and secondly, he  emphasised the consequences of that failure. I will look at both those points,  beginning with the first.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Alex Attwood emphasised the impossibility of finding  agreement by 2012 on the future shape of a Ministry, and he purported that that  was an argument for tabling his proposed amendments. On the surface, that  argument has a certain ring to it, from our perspective. Mr Attwood said that  there has been a series of issues that the Executive failed to reach agreement  on and that that is evidence that they are not capable of reaching agreement.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That argument does not bear up to close scrutiny for a  number of other reasons. First, if we had followed that pattern in 1998, we  would not be sitting here now. Secondly, if we had said that we would not move  forward because the risk of failure was too great, we would still be where we  were in 1998 and we would perhaps be even worse off.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We did not say that the issue was trying to get the UUP and  the SDLP to agree on matters in the future. We did not say that getting  engagement between the UUP with Sinn F&eacute;in when the electoral tables were turned  was a reason not to proceed with the process. We did not even say that the idea  of getting the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in to go into Government together, which was  unimaginable at the time, was a good enough reason to stop the process. In such  instances, instead of not embarking on the process, the answer is to carry out  the process in a controlled way and to see it for what it is &mdash; a process. The  process will evolve over time in the context and circumstances that present  themselves, and it is dependent on the work that will be done over the next 30  months. I cannot accept the argument that Executive failures are a reason for  stopping the process of devolution.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The other argument was about what will happen if we fail to  agree by May 2012. For me, such a scenario raises a much deeper question, which  was not touched on. If we cannot agree on what happens with the Ministry for  policing and justice by 2012, much more significant questions about the future  of the institutions will be raised. We all realise that. There is more import  and more pressure to reach a solution by 2012. It is very simplistic to say  that we cannot do it. I do not buy into that argument, because there is too  much at stake if we do not agree a solution.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If it is so inconceivable that parties in the House are  capable of reaching agreement on the issue in 30 months, how come we have an  interim agreement that people are happy to sign off on? The logic is that, if  people can sign off on an interim agreement, it is not beyond their  capabilities to sign off on a longer-term agreement. I cannot follow the logic  of the argument that we cannot reach agreement.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Attwood then argued about the consequences of failure.  There seems to be conflict in his argument, because its logic was very  contorted. Mr Alex Maskey highlighted that in his speech. In great depth and  with great vigour, Mr Attwood painted the most apocalyptic scenario possible  for May 2012. He used the word &ldquo;catastrophic&rdquo; twice. I listened carefully to  his description of what could happen in 2012, and it conjured a picture in my  mind of prison doors being left open, prisoners wandering onto the streets and various  other types of madness and mayhem. All of that was based on the assumption that  the Assembly would fail to agree.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Attwood then said that Westminster would not allow such a scenario  to happen. According to his legal advice and in his view, an Order in Council  would come from the Secretary of State to stave off the apocalypse. At that  point, I was able to draw breath again and feel much calmer about the  situation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">After posing the grave and potentially catastrophic  consequences of a failure to agree, Mr Attwood reassured us that there will not  be a cataclysmic meltdown and that there is a fallback position. His concern  seemed to switch from the apocalypse ahead to his suspicion that the First  Minister and the deputy First Minister know that there is a fallback position  but do not want to articulate it in the Assembly. That is what I am not clear  about. I am not sure that it matters whether people know that there is a  fallback position, because, any time between now and 2012, legislation and  amendments to deal with a likely meltdown could be made in Westminster. Frankly, it is inconceivable  that the Government would allow our Prison Service to implode, for example.  Therefore, I cannot understand the logic of an argument that states that, on  the one hand, there will be cataclysm and then states that there will not and  that, because people will not admit that, we should vote against the Bill in  its present form.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  Those who supported and passed the legislation that provides for the sunset  clause in May 2012 have literally legislated for failure. We did not introduce  the concepts of failure, collapse and dissolution. Members legislated for that  because it was the best interim solution that they could come up with. Those  who supported it, particularly Sinn F&eacute;in, have made a virtue of saying that  there is no fallback position. We believe that there could be a fallback  position that could be used by the British Government. However, it may not  work, because it depends on votes in the House.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: I will  address several aspects of that intervention. First, the matter seems to have  been distilled down to the SDLP trying to point out that what Sinn F&eacute;in has  said all along is incorrect. That seems more like an attack for party political  purposes than dealing with concerns about the stability of the justice  Department. I suspect that such logic underpins a lot of what we are listening  to today. That is part of the difficulty.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not understand how anyone can believe, based on their  legal advice, that there is a fallback position and, at the same time,  articulate an argument that says that there is no such position. It is  completely illogical, and the argument does not stack up. Regardless of whether  the fallback position exists at the minute, it could be created at any point in  the future. Therefore, the idea of apocalypse does not add up. The SDLP has  argued that it is, in essence, trying to avert crisis and crisis-proof the  legislation, yet it has proposed a series of amendments that appear to be  designed to precipitate a series of mini crises in the system.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  No.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  The Member beside me says no. However, putting time frames, deadlines and  demands on such matters and introducing additional sunset clauses into the  legislation has the potential to create more of a crisis.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 1 sets a deadline. Everybody in the Chamber  recognises that the issue will be subject to detailed and sensitive discussions  in which everyone in the House has an interest. I agree entirely with Members  who feel that, for whatever reason, they do not know all the facts. They should  know all the facts, because this is a matter of importance, not only to parties  represented in the Executive but to those that are not represented. The  Alliance Party&rsquo;s voters need to have confidence, too, as do those who vote for  the SDLP, the Ulster Unionists, the DUP, Sinn F&eacute;in, the Green Party, the PUP  and others who sit in the House. People need to have confidence that the system  will work, because it is a serious matter. We do not take issue with any of  that. However, creating deadlines is a way to heap on pressure, and it is  deeply unhelpful. I suspect that it exposes the SDLP&rsquo;s need to do down any  proposals that come from the Executive. That is unfortunate.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have read amendment Nos 2, 3 and 4 several times. I  listened carefully to Alex Attwood&rsquo;s speech, in which he proposed the  amendments, to try to get to the bottom of what they would achieve. That  remains unclear. The amendments seem to force the First Minister and the deputy  First Minister to make written and oral statements to the House within seven  days, after which there would be a vote.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  That is correct.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  The Member has provided helpful clarification from a sedentary position. That  is what I thought that it meant. Therefore, I am unclear about the point of the  amendments. The seven-day requirement seems to place potentially unrealistic  and silly deadlines in the Bill in the hope that somebody will drop the ball,  not jump through the hoop, and revert to d&rsquo;Hondt. Moreover, it seems  unnecessary, because no other legislation that has been passed in the House has  proposed that somebody has to report within seven days. Indeed, if people want  the First Minister and the deputy First Minister to explain &mdash; I think that is  the word used in the amendment &mdash; their view on the issues, they can do so at  any time now. They do not have to wait until the Bill is passed. It does not  change anything. I cannot get my head around that, because the situation has  not changed one iota.</p>
      <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr McClarty] in the Chair)</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">4.00 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  The Member said that no one has ever proposed here that statements should come  from the First Minister and deputy First Minister, but I recall that her party  moved amendments to the Financial Assistance Bill that would have required that  statements be made by the First Minister and the deputy First Minister in  relation to the implementation of that Bill and any actions flowing from it.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: I  said that I did not recall a piece of legislation being passed anywhere that  required statements to be made within seven days. It is clear that Mr Durkan  was not paying attention, because our proposal was that the First Minister and  deputy First Minister should report to the Assembly on an annual basis. It was  an ongoing clause, not simply another hurdle that they had to jump over after  commencement with a once and once only explanation. The comparison does not  stack up, because there was substance to our amendment. There is no substance  to the SDLP&rsquo;s amendments.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will move to the issue of clarification and explanation.  The First Minister and deputy First Minister are in the Chamber, so perhaps  when they respond they will be able to give clarification. However, my reading  is that they could come in and provide us with an explanation. It might not  satisfy us, but such an explanation, written or oral, would not change  anything. They would simply have to provide the explanation in order to tick  the box. That achieves absolutely nothing, as far as I can tell. I am slightly  bemused by that, but on reading the amendments together, it is clear that they  are designed so that, assuming that the SDLP&rsquo;s arguments in relation to clause  2 are lost, another opportunity is created to insert amendments after  commencement. The SDLP&rsquo;s argument is not about trying to get clarity, because  that can be obtained at any time. <em>[Interruption.]</em></p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Durkan has been allowed a significant number of  interventions, but nothing seems to satisfy him, because as I try to make my  contribution to the debate, he is constantly chirping in my ear, which is very  distracting. I have been generous with the Member in allowing him to have  interventions. I wish that he would either stand up and make his point or allow  me to make mine.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Attwood made a long and meandering speech containing a  lot of convoluted logic, but eventually, at the end, we got to the core of the  issue. He said that the SDLP felt entitled to the justice Ministry and that  that entitlement would not be guaranteed under clause 2. There were those who,  in previous interventions, said that they were happy to run d&rsquo;Hondt for all 11  Departments, but Mr Attwood said that he objected strongly to the SDLP&rsquo;s being  excluded from the process to appoint a justice Minister. He raised the issue  that the DUP did not see the SDLP as fit to do the job and that his party was  being blocked as a consequence of Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s position. There was more to Mr  Attwood&rsquo;s speech than the issue of being nominated for any Ministry.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">However, while the justice Ministry would not be guaranteed  under clause 2, neither is it ruled out. It is not inconceivable that the SDLP  could be nominated and voted through on a cross-community basis. The assumption  that it will not happen is an SDLP assumption; it is not shared by anyone else.  To be fair, Mr Attwood delivered a heart-rending plea for the SDLP to get the  justice Ministry, which almost brought a tear to my eye. He said that his party  had been slighted and that its contribution to policing and justice had not  been fully recognised.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party could make an equally heart-rending  plea: we could say that throughout the years when things were very difficult in  Northern Ireland, coming from a cross-community background and representing a  difficult constituency, the Alliance Party maintained its links with the police  service and sat on the Police Authority when others would not join it and would  not do that job. It is a bit rich for people to expect sympathy from those of  us who weathered the storm when it was very difficult to do so. From that point  of view, I do not have a lot of sympathy on that point. However, I am less  concerned with who the Minister for justice will be, what party he or she  represents or where he or she is from, than I am about what a Minister for  justice will do for the people whom they are elected to serve. That is what  matters: it is the programme that a Minister for justice will follow and what  that person will achieve that is of consequence. I cannot see any reason why  any party here would be guided simply by self-interest.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Other Members have raised the issue of d&rsquo;Hondt in relation  to clause 2. If an eleventh Ministry were to be added, various meetings with  the Secretary of State notwithstanding, d&rsquo;Hondt would have to be rerun for all  Departments. That is clearly stated in the Northern Ireland Act 1998. If that  were the case, I do not think that anyone believes that policing and justice  would still be on the table when the SDLP got to make the fifth choice, let  alone the eleventh. It would say something fairly skewed and malign about other  parties in the House if it were still on the table at that stage.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have some sympathy with Danny Kennedy on that point. He  said that the debate was surreal at times. I agree; if we think that policing  and justice can be delivered by any means other than ongoing political  dialogues and agreement, we are fooling ourselves.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If the mechanisms that were used in 1998 were sufficient  for this task and could create the required confidence, I suspect that they  would have been used by now. That is not the political reality of this situation,  and we need to wake up and accept that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am disappointed that the SDLP seems to oppose the  devolution of policing and justice unless it benefits them either directly  through that Ministry, or indirectly by obtaining a second seat in the Executive.  In an intervention to Alex Maskey earlier, the SDLP leader &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  The SDLP is fully committed to the devolution of policing and justice, without  conditions. We are fully committed to that, and we have made that plain. I do  not know how I can emphasise that point more.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  Perhaps if the SDLP had voted in favour of the Second Stage of the Bill, that  would have made it clear. The issue there was the principle of the devolution  of policing and justice. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Durkan is again interjecting from a sedentary position.  However, in an intervention to Alex Attwood&rsquo;s speech, he walked us through the  process at Westminster  very carefully, and explained how he could vote in favour of a Bill at Second  Reading and table a series of amendments at Committee Stage. One should do the  equivalent in these circumstances.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  The implication of supporting the Bill at Second Stage was that one supported  the principle of the devolution of policing and justice and, in particular, the  creation of a justice Department in Northern Ireland. It is in order  for the SDLP to propose an amendment to change the mechanism in the Bill and go  back to d&rsquo;Hondt; that is a logical position for them to argue from if they  wish. However, voting in favour of the Second Stage of the Bill would still  have allowed them to do that and, at the same time, would have made clear their  support for devolution, whereas voting against it sent out, at best, a very  dangerous, mixed message.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  That is exactly the case. The normal way to deal with such a situation is to  vote in favour of a Bill at Second Stage and to table any amendments at the  next stage. If the amendments fall and people believe that the Bill as it  stands is unacceptable, it is at that point that they should vote against it.  One does not vote against a Bill at Second Stage if one is in favour of the  principle of it, and the principle of this Bill is to devolve policing and  justice powers and to create a Ministry of justice. Therefore, the SDLP&rsquo;s  position with regard to the devolution of those powers is unclear.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Kennedy raised some concerns. He referred to the  difficulties of the Bill creating a puppet Ministry. He was concerned that, if  appointed in the way that was suggested in the Bill, the justice Minister would  be a puppet. I do not believe that to be the case; however, I believe that  there is a risk that the justice Minister could be a puppet.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The mechanism for appointing the justice Minister will make  them no more or less of a puppet than any other Minister; it does not change  anything. They would arrive at the Executive table with the same authority and  ability to do their job. However, some issues could create the circumstances in  which we would be dealing with a puppet Minister. The problem would, first, lie  in the potential for a Minister to be removed by cross-community consent. We  cannot deal with that, because it is dealt with in legislation that went  through another place. It is not something &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  No; I will not give way on that point.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The way in which a Minister can be removed from office has  the potential, in certain circumstances, to make that Minister more susceptible  to pressure. However, we cannot deal with that issue, because our legislation  is subordinate to the Westminster  legislation, which sets out how any Minister would be removed from office.  Indeed, the issue arises only when a Minister who is so desperate to hang on to  his or her ministerial seat does not resist such pressure. Therefore, in  addition to there being a poor mechanism for their removal, it would require a  weak-willed Minister with no backbone for that situation to arise. If we are to  subject someone to a cross-community vote in the House, I hope that we will  pick someone of sufficient calibre and robustness and who has enough backbone  to withstand that pressure.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members from the smaller parties on the Executive wax  lyrical about the potential for a Minister of justice to be a puppet, but it is  dangerous to tread on such ground. It may not be possible to eject smaller  parties&rsquo; Ministers from their ministerial seats under d&rsquo;Hondt, but those  Ministers have little say over their budgets. Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP have the  lion&rsquo;s share of the votes and can make those decisions. Those Ministers do not  have much control over what legislation they can bring to the House, because  that is largely in the gift of Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP as well. Some people might  say that Ministers from the smaller parties in the Executive, even though they  were nominated under the d&rsquo;Hondt system, could be puppets if they do not have  sufficient backbone to walk away when push comes to shove and when they feel  that they have been maligned or mistreated.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  The Member clearly does not listen to, or heed, the First Minister&rsquo;s assertions  that we have a four-party mandatory coalition. There are no puppets in this  Administration, and it is not expected that there will be any. The Member seems  to doubt that.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: I  was explaining the risk of someone&rsquo;s becoming a puppet Minister. I would not be  so rude as to suggest that any of the Ministers from his party or the SDLP is a  mere puppet. If Mr Kennedy feels aggrieved by my comments, I may have struck a  chord that I did not intend to. I was simply saying that it is possible for  Ministers to be nothing more than puppets under the current system if they are  willing to accept whatever the two main parties foist on them rather than  running the risk of having to walk away. Unless Ministers have the backbone to  walk away in such circumstances, they risk being puppets. The question for  Ministers is whether they can be more than puppets in the Executive. I will  leave it for Mr Kennedy to decide that on behalf of his colleagues.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  The Member speaks in a very principled way and, indeed, almost claims that the  Alliance Party is the only principled party in the Assembly. She has spoken  very nobly about how neither she nor her party has any interest in who becomes  the Minister of justice and says that the Alliance Party is concerned only with  the outcomes from our having a Department of justice. The Alliance Party was  prominent in describing itself as &ldquo;the party of opposition&rdquo;. Indeed, it was the  opposition in the Assembly for many months. When Bills were debated, the  Alliance Party was assiduous in proposing amendments and discussing them at  great length.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">However, it is noticeable that the Alliance Party has not  proposed an amendment today. The Member has not used the word &ldquo;opposition&rdquo; at  all and has described her party as being &ldquo;outside the Executive&rdquo;. A reasonable person  might conclude that her position is less principled than before and that she  and her party may have a vested interest in taking the stance that they are  taking.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:  Order. Some private conversations are being conducted in the Chamber, and that  is very distracting for me, not to mention for the Member who is on his or her  feet. If Members wish to carry on their private conversations, I ask that they  do so in the Lobbies or elsewhere in the Building. I also remind Members that  interventions should be short and sharp.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I appreciate both of those points. I will be  clear about the issue that Mr O&rsquo;Loan raised: I said that we had no selfish  interest. I also said that we were less interested in who the Minister was and  which party he or she came from than what they do. That is a principled  position. If Mr O&rsquo;Loan is asking me, as a politician and a member of the  Alliance Party, whether I aspire to be in government, the answer is yes. If  that makes me unprincipled, what does it make any other party that sits in this  Chamber? What would it make me, other than a fool, if I were to say that I did  not aspire to be in government for my party? Of course political parties have  aspirations to be in government, but not at any price. That is what gives  principle to our position. If Mr O&rsquo;Loan does not understand that, I am not sure  that there is much that I can say to help him.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Loan also talked about proposing amendments. We  propose amendments to legislation as and when we feel that they are required.  However, we have articulated an argument today to explain why, based on our  principles, we are happy with the legislation, which represents a move away  from a mechanistic approach to the nomination and appointment of Executive  Ministers and towards an approach that we prefer. Regardless of the outcome in  respect of the make-up of the Executive, we would prefer that that body be  formed voluntarily. We believe that this is a move in that direction, and that  is a principled position.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">On the issue of opposition, I am not in the sad and  unfortunate situation of being confused about my role in this House. I am  outside the Executive and I am part of the opposition. However, it would serve  the Member well to talk to his party about what its role is, because it seems  to be confused: it holds seats at the Executive table, and acts as opposition  in the House. That is a much more confused and less principled position than  the one that my party has adopted.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, Members will be glad to hear, there have  been many political fixes on the road from 1998 to 2009. Some of those were  designed by the SDLP and the Ulster Unionists and others by the DUP and Sinn  F&eacute;in. Some have further entrenched division in this Assembly, some have reduced  it, some have moved us forward, and some have made it much more difficult for  us to achieve progress. Some of those fixes have been based on good politics  and others, frankly, have not. That is the reality of the situation. My party  will look at each situation on its merits. The Bill provides for a move away  from a rigid, mechanistic method of power sharing and towards a situation in  which cross-community consent becomes more embedded in how an Executive are  formed. The Alliance  party believes that that is a good thing, and, therefore, we support clause 2.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill moves us to a situation in which the Minister of  justice will be from Northern    Ireland. There will be difficult decisions  ahead on finance and many other issues, but the person who makes those  decisions will, when they need a police officer, call 999 and go to the same  people as me and the people whom I represent. That is a step forward, not a  step back. That is a welcome change, and, therefore, we will support the Bill  and oppose the amendments.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I am sure that there were some Members in the House to hear that Mrs Long was  coming to a conclusion, Mr Deputy Speaker. Perhaps that has changed because you  have called me to speak, but I will do my best to make a valuable contribution  to the debate.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is no secret that my party and I support the devolution  of policing and justice. However, as we have made clear on many occasions, that  requires community confidence. One element that helps to build community  confidence is confidence in the institutions to which matters are devolved.  That is why clause 2 is so important, not just to me and my party, but to the  community that we represent.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">During his lengthy contribution at the start of the debate,  Mr Attwood talked about people needing to live in the political real world. He  is not living in the real world if he believes that there is any other method  of appointing a justice Minister that is capable of commanding community  confidence in Northern Ireland &mdash; critically, unionist community confidence &mdash;  other than that contained in clause 2.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In making a case for clause 2, I must stress that, as  desirable as it may be for some of us, the Member who takes up the justice  post, from whatever party they come, will not do so simply on the DUP&rsquo;s say-so.  The decision is not something that we wholly control. The Member who becomes  Minister of justice must be able to command cross-community support in the  Assembly.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am sorry that the SDLP has such a slavish devotion to the  principle of d&rsquo;Hondt that, in its eyes, nothing else is feasible, viable or  possible. However, as Mrs Long pointed out, there are ways other than d&rsquo;Hondt  by which we can get cross-community buy-in. I ask the same question that I did  at Second Stage: how much more cross-community can we get than a clause and a  method of appointment that requires support for an individual by a majority of  Members on each side of the House? Somebody who can come through that test and  command that support will surely also have wider support in the community.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As the First Minister, Mr Robinson, pointed out, the  cross-community voting mechanism is used regularly in the House. We use it to  appoint the Speaker and Deputy Speakers, and during the passage of Budget  Bills. We can also invoke cross-community support mechanisms in the House if  Members decide that a matter is critical. The point is that to have  cross-community support for an individual, or any proposal in the House, is not  so alien, so different or so abnormal. It is something that we do &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Yes.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  note that the Member said that there is no method other than cross-community  support in the House that will secure community confidence. In particular, he  said, &ldquo;unionist community confidence&rdquo;. Therefore, I take it that he is  rejecting a continuation of d&rsquo;Hondt, which would lead to the SDLP&rsquo;s taking the  new justice portfolio.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Member make it absolutely clear that it was not mere  rhetoric when his party leader, the First Minister, said that he would reject  the SDLP nominee? Was the DUP taking a determined and fixed stance to reject an  SDLP nominee for Minister in the Department of justice?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I am not the first person to make the following point. Others have done so, but  I will go as slowly as I can. I honestly do not think that the Member gets the  point. The SDLP seems to have some sense of ownership of the justice position.  If the SDLP were to get its desire, and if the position were subject to the  d&rsquo;Hondt mechanism, there would be absolutely no guarantee that the Member&rsquo;s  party would get it. However, we repeatedly hear that the SDLP is being deprived  of the Ministry &mdash; that it is losing out.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That is not the case, because d&rsquo;Hondt would be triggered  for all Ministries, and it is highly unlikely that the eleventh pick would be  the Department of justice. I would be very surprised if the Department were not  chosen sooner.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: In  his intervention, Mr O&rsquo;Loan used an interesting phrase: &ldquo;continuation of  d&rsquo;Hondt&rdquo;. There appears to be some confusion in the SDLP, because Mr Hamilton  was asked specifically about opposition to the SDLP&rsquo;s holding the justice  Ministry &mdash; not any Ministry or the eleventh Ministry, but the justice Ministry  &mdash; under a &ldquo;continuation of d&rsquo;Hondt&rdquo;. However, others in the SDLP are saying  that they are happy for the eleventh Ministry to be any portfolio, not just the  justice portfolio. There seems to be confusion, and I cannot understand what  the problem really is.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I concur with the Member. I am not sure whether the SDLP is upset about losing  out on gaining the Department of justice or the Department for Employment and  Learning, but it does not seem to register with that party that there cannot be  a continuation of d&rsquo;Hondt. D&rsquo;Hondt does not work like that; it is a system that  runs throughout. It is not possible to allocate 10 Departments and then go back  for an eleventh; the process would have to begin again.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I may be able to clear up the confusion on both sides of the Chamber. There is  no confusion, because, looking at the Hansard report, we have been able to  confirm that if the d&rsquo;Hondt process were to be run, the SDLP would be entitled  to the eleventh Ministry, whatever it may be. The critical issue, Mr Hamilton,  is that &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. The Member should refer all his remarks through the Chair.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  The critical point is that, regardless of whether the SDLP looked for the  justice Ministry, on 8 July 2009, outside 10 Downing Street, on the record and  in front of cameras, Mr Hamilton&rsquo;s party leader, the First Minister, said &ldquo;I&rsquo;m  going to veto&rdquo; an SDLP nominee for justice Minister. There is no confusion,  because the issue was put on the table by the leader of the DUP, the First  Minister, independently of whether or not the SDLP was entitled to the justice  Ministry. It was your party that said explicitly on the record that it would  stop us.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  The Member has got very upset about that point, which reveals the truth behind  it all. It is the loss of the chance to have the Department of justice in the  hands of the SDLP that is at the core of everything that is going on today. It  is not some high point  of principle; it is the loss of that potential position for that party. Nobody  from the Member&rsquo;s party has been put forward, and, although I am not going to  prejudge anything, whoever is ultimately selected to take on the Minister of  justice post must be capable of commanding the support of both communities. As  everyone knows, the position is of such critical importance and sensitivity  that the person who is appointed to it must capable of commanding support from  both sides of the community.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member quoted the First Minister &mdash; who I see is back in  his place &mdash; but it is not only the First Minister who ruled out the SDLP for  the Minister of justice role; the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party did so as  well. In that respect, he is in good company. More than one unionist party is  ruling out members of Mr Attwood&rsquo;s party from taking the position. Community  confidence is at the core of clause 2; it is absolutely critical that that  confidence is there. In the past, my party has made it clear that it would not  have confidence in Sinn F&eacute;in holding the post, and, although I have no  particular insight into the mind of republicans, I am pretty sure that they are  not too keen on any member of my party holding the position.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Do not take it personally.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I certainly do not take it personally.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In that respect &mdash; and this is where I have some confusion  about the SDLP&rsquo;s opposition to clause 2 &mdash; this is not some sort of unionist  utopia that is being put forward. It is not what only either unionists,  republicans or nationalists want; it is what both sides in the Chamber want.  That is the critical point; whoever is put forward must be capable of  commanding support from both sides of the community.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, some Members may be exhibiting a slavish  devotion to one particular method, but we have to be much more innovative, and  there are different ways to achieve community support. Given that we use  cross-community votes in the Chamber on quite a few occasions, it is not a  particularly original method. Consensus and inclusivity are at the core of  clause 2, and, down through the years, the SDLP has preached ad infinitum that  we must have consensus and be inclusive. Those principles are at the core of  the clause, so I am confused about why the SDLP opposes its standing part of  the Bill. It may not be its preferred option, but it must at least accept that  it is an option for having consensus and inclusivity and for achieving  cross-community support for whoever the justice Minister is.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I turn to the opposition to this clause from the unionist  Benches. I do not want to go into an historical retrospective about what people  have agreed to in the past. Others have not engaged in that, and I do not want  to go down that path, unless provoked into doing so. I have to point out that  the clause protects the interests of unionism. Their opposition comes from a  concern that there is sensitivity in the unionist community about the position  of a justice Minister. Emotions run high, and there is great concern about who  might take that position. That is why those Members have stated their  opposition, notwithstanding things said and done down through the years and in  the not too distant past.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I ask why they oppose the clause, when it protects the  interests of unionism and allows unionists a clear say on who holds the very  sensitive position of Minister of justice. No other option in legislation  available to the Assembly offers the protection offered by clause 2. Clause 2  ensures that political unionism has a say over who holds that position; that is  something on which those Members should reflect. As I mentioned, they said  recently that they oppose both Sinn F&eacute;in and the SDLP holding that position.  This goes back to the point about the rerunning of the d&rsquo;Hondt system. No other  system protects that position and ensures that certain members of certain  parties do not hold it. I ask those Members to reflect on that in their  opposition to this clause and their support for the SDLP&rsquo;s proposal. Clause 2,  as it stands, protects the interests of unionism that the DUP has espoused and  which the Ulster Unionist Party has latterly come around to espousing.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am grateful to the Member for giving way. Does he understand that one of our  primary objections is that the institution of the Executive was formed on the  basis of the d&rsquo;Hondt system and that implies that that system should be used to  choose Ministers during this mandate?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Likewise, will the Member concede that the Alliance Party,  in its current strength, is not entitled under the d&rsquo;Hondt system, as of right,  to a Ministry? However, a convenient agreement is being hatched, which is being  labelled &ldquo;cross-community support&rdquo;, to enable the Alliance Party to expect that  that Ministry will be given to its charge.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  The d&rsquo;Hondt system may well have been the mechanism used at the start. However,  I would have thought that the Member would agree with my point about the  sensitivity of the office of a Minister of justice &mdash; indeed, a first Minister  of justice &mdash; and that he would agree with the position outlined in clause 2  that cross-community support is essential.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member may be mathematically correct that the Alliance  Party has not the strength of numbers to have the right to a Department  according to the d&rsquo;Hondt system as it is currently constituted. However, I suggest  that that is not the issue at hand: rather, it is the need to have confidence  on a cross-community basis in the person appointed Minister of justice. I would  have thought that the Member would agree with me on that.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  am grateful to the Member for giving way. This is not about the Alliance Party;  it is about a new Department and the mechanism of election. In today&rsquo;s debate,  the Alliance Party is judging the issue on its merits. It is not about our  party.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Member recognise that, with respect to size of  mandates, it is commonplace around the world for parties that are smaller than  the Alliance Party in terms of seats in the legislature and support in elections  to be in government legitimately? South of the border, there is the recent  example of the Progressive Democrats and, at present, the Green Party, both of  which have proportionately smaller mandates than the Alliance Party but play a  full and active part in voluntary coalition Governments.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  The Member has made a very valid point. In other democracies not too far from  here, where coalition Governments are the norm, parties very much smaller than  the Alliance Party regularly form part of the Government and regularly punch  well above their weight.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I say to Mr Kennedy that this is not a point about one  particular party; it is about having a system in place that commands community  support. Obviously, we on these Benches are keen to ensure that there is  unionist confidence in any system that appoints a Minister of justice. I ask Mr  Kennedy and his party to reflect again on how any of the other available  systems could command cross-community support.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The Member was in the process of making the key point when he was  interrupted. That key point is that a future Department of justice will have  responsibility for the most sensitive life and death issues that affect our  community.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If the SDLP were to achieve the post of Minister of justice  using the d&rsquo;Hondt system, it would mean that that Minister would command less  than 15% of the support of the Assembly. It would also depend on a SDLP  Minister being able to gain the support of all of his or her colleagues, and  that is unlikely. There is a requirement in the Department of Justice Bill for  the person selected as Minister of justice to have the support of more than 50%  of both sections of the community through the designation system.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  That is absolutely correct. Perhaps it would be better for the SDLP to wait  until its leadership contest is decided before it nominates someone as Minister  of justice.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The issues that will be dealt with by a future Minister of  justice are so sensitive that a higher threshold for the post is required.  Therefore, to subject the post to the vagaries of the d&rsquo;Hondt process, as the  UUP would do, despite acknowledging those sensitivities, which, I think, they  now do, is something that they need to reflect on. Opposing for the sake of  opposing or doing so for spurious reasons such as timing &mdash; there are no timings  involved, which will be demonstrated when the second set of amendments is  proposed &mdash; is wrong. The UUP must reflect on its opposition, which is not  particularly principled, is entirely manufactured, and does not represent the  position that it has espoused in recent times or indeed that has been espoused  by the wider unionist community.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to move on &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I have been trying to move on to my second set of points for some time, but I  will give way to the Member.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Will the Member confirm explicitly what he has said implicitly: the  cross-community mechanism has been chosen by the two main parties and his own  party in particular to exclude a nationalist from the position of Minister of  justice? In fact, the Member has said what the SDLP has said all along, and the  message is that no nationalists need apply.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I have allowed the Member to get his intra-nationalist warfare sound bite in,  but I cannot see how, if he examines clause 2, he can conclude that its  intention is to exclude anyone. Instead, it embodies inclusiveness and the need  to have cross-community support for whoever is nominated. The point that the  First Minister made was that whoever is selected will ultimately have the  support of the majority of Members on the unionist and nationalist Benches.  That is inclusiveness and consensus and exactly the type of principles that the  Member and his party have been ramming down everyone else&rsquo;s throat for the last  number of years.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will now move on to the other amendments tabled by Mr  Attwood. Amendment Nos 3 and 4 deal with the requirement for reporting and  voting by the Assembly on what may or may not happen in May 2012. Having  listened to Mr Attwood speaking about those amend&shy;ments and using words such as  &ldquo;grave&rdquo;, &ldquo;acute&rdquo; and &ldquo;catastrophic&rdquo; I was interested in the motivation behind  the amendments. Were they motivated by some genuine concern about what may or  may not happen after May 2012? I listened intently and with interest to what he  said to find out whether he was genuinely concerned about what might happen or  whether there was some other motivation. It did not take too long to see that  there was another motivation, and it is not genuine concern about some  catastrophic state of affairs in May 2012; it was about protecting a slavish  devotion to d&rsquo;Hondt and trying to protect the SDLP party position on the  justice Ministry.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">No one in the Assembly should be planning for failure.  Times have genuinely changed when a member of the SDLP is more pessimistic than  me about the future. We should not be saying that the world will end, things  will collapse, and it will all be doom and gloom and catastrophe in May 2012.  No one believes that, if the Assembly cannot agree a continuation to the  current arrangements or even an alternative set of arrangements, policing and  justice will suddenly just end. Halloween is not too far behind us, but Mrs  Long mentioned a nightmarish scenario in which prison doors would be opened &mdash; I  thought that had happened before; a recurring nightmare, perhaps &mdash; police would  not be on the streets or have any resources and the justice system would grind  to a halt. That sort of nightmare scenario, implied by Mr Attwood, is not at  all realistic.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I concur with others who said that the argument that was  put forward was based on twisted logic. We are facing what Mr Attwood regards  as a catastrophic set of affairs or there is a fallback position. We cannot  have both: it is one or t&rsquo;other. However, that is the twisted logic that was  put forward in support of the amendments. I am not confused; my interpretation  of the section of the Northern Ireland Act 2009 that deals with this issue is  that the Department, having been created, would dissolve unless the Assembly  passes a motion to sustain it, or &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  Is the Member saying that there is no fallback? Is he supporting the  legislation on the basis that there is no fallback?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  The legislation clearly places an imperative on us all, including the Member&rsquo;s  party, to get engaged in developing a long-term resolution to that issue. That,  in one respect, is a fallback, and I do not believe that there will be some  awful set of circumstances, or that Northern Ireland would be allowed  to continue without having any policing and justice powers resting anywhere. It  is crazy to think that that would be the case. Services would not just simply  end at the end of May 2012, as Mr Attwood suggested.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Attwood claimed that these matters cannot be sorted out  or that it would take a long time and that there was simply no chance of  getting them sorted out by 2012. By tabling the amendments, his party is  attempting to precipitate a crisis much earlier in the process than he  suggested might already be the case. The SDLP amendment would mean that, within  seven days of this Bill receiving Royal Assent, the First Minister and deputy  First Minister have to make a report on what the fallback position is. Within  seven days of that, the Assembly must then endorse the current arrangements or  other arrangements. Therefore, instead of having the time between Royal Assent  and May 2012 to see how the arrangements work and to see whether people are  content or whether they want to look at other possibilities, the SDLP is  proposing, much earlier, within a fortnight, to force a crisis on the Assembly.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am in no doubt that, in that fortnight, SDLP members  would do absolutely nothing to assist in coming to a long-term arrangement.  They would happily sit on their hands and do nothing, because it is the SDLP&rsquo;s  belief that the fallback is that the d&rsquo;Hondt principle would kick in. In fact,  the amendment proposes that d&rsquo;Hondt become the de facto position for nominating  a Minister of justice. That is at the heart of the SDLP amendments.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The amendments have not been tabled out of a genuine  concern about what will happen after 2012 and a fear that violence and chaos  will run amok across the streets of Northern Ireland. That is not what  it is about. That concern is feigned and synthetic; it is not genuine. It is  about d&rsquo;Hondt and the SDLP&rsquo;s belief, as Mr O&rsquo;Loan and others enunciated, that,  under that principle, the SDLP is entitled to the position of justice Minister.  That is what it comes back to. It is nothing to do with a genuine concern about  law and order in Northern    Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP wants to force a crisis onto the Assembly within a  fortnight of the passage of this legislation. It wants to force a crisis in  advance of the actual devolution of policing and justice powers. The effect of  that would be that the likelihood of devolving the powers to the Assembly would  be little or nil, because the SDLP would be forcing a crisis that would take a  long-term decision. That is why we want the interim measure. It will allow us  the advantage of space and time, until 2012, to agree on something long-term to  which everybody can subscribe. As Mrs Long said, if the SDLP fails to kill  clause 2, this is its fallback position. It is about the SDLP trying and wanting  to become justice Minister. It is not about any genuine concern.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Yes. I was trying to conclude, but I will give way.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I anticipated that the Member was trying to conclude, and that is why I asked  him to give way. For Mr Hamilton to say to the SDLP, never mind its  constituency, that it does not have genuine concern for law and order flies in  the face of any objective evidence base or realistic assessment about where the  SDLP stands on the issues. Does Mr Hamilton think that that accurately reflects  the SDLP position? Although Mr Hamilton might say it, I have enough confidence  that he does not believe it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Does Mr Hamilton accept that, under the SDLP&rsquo;s amendment  Nos 2, 3 and 4, the outcome will be that we have a Minister who is either  elected under d&rsquo;Hondt or under cross-community provision? That will not create  a crisis; it will create certainty and the appointment of a Minister who knows,  one way or the other, the terms under which he or she will act until May 2012.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Hamilton has to get his head around what will happen in  2012. Will there or will there not be a vacuum? Mr Hamilton, as a considered  man and as a potential legislator, has an obligation to himself and his  constituency to explain and understand that. That is the issue before the  House. I ask him at this late stage, as he concludes, to address that issue.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Mr Deputy Speaker, perhaps you can correct me if I am wrong, but I am under the  appre&shy;hension that I am an actual legislator. The Member may not like how I  vote on particular pieces of legislation, but a legislator I am, as is he.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: You  have a better chance of getting something on the statute books.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I will leave that comment. With regard to Mr Attwood&rsquo;s first point, I believe  that his party supports law and order. If he cares to check the Hansard report  tomorrow, he will see that I said that I did not believe that his tabling of  the amendments was motivated by a genuine concern about what happens with law  and order in Northern    Ireland post May 2012. It is not about his  party&rsquo;s support for law and order in general.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In tabling the amendments, Mr Attwood and his party are  asking for a long-term solution to be put in place before we have even tried  the short-term solution and, indeed, before we have even had policing and justice  powers devolved to the Assembly. Unfortunately, they are supported by members  of the Ulster Unionist Party. If by some miracle his amendments are accepted by  the House, I ask Mr Attwood to reflect on how helpful those would be in getting  policing and justice powers devolved in the first place, never mind achieving a  long-term solution.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I go back to my first point: I think that we  are all committed to having policing and justice powers devolved to the  Northern Ireland Assembly, yet there are outstanding matters that must be dealt  with, not least community confidence. Community confidence has as much to do  with finance as it has to do with the institutional arrangements. Those  institutional arrangements and community confidence, particularly in the  unionist community, are predicated on clause 2 standing part, to ensure that  whoever holds the sensitive post of justice Minister is capable of commanding  support on both sides of the Chamber. That is why, in the spirit of consensus  and cross-party support, I support clause 2 and oppose the SDLP&rsquo;s argument that  that clause should not stand part of the Bill. I also oppose the SDLP&rsquo;s other  amendments and ask the House to do the same.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Once again we have the vexed problem of mobile phones and  Blackberries. I ask all Members to switch off their mobile phones, Blackberries  or other electronic equipment as they are interfering with the sound system in  the Chamber.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I oppose the first group of  amendments &mdash; amendment Nos 1, 2, 3 and 4 &mdash; and I declare an interest as a  member of the Policing Board. The Bill demonstrates that the process of  delivering policing and justice powers into the hands of locally elected  politicians is moving forward. Key stages in that process have been reached,  including the report of the Assembly and Executive Review Committee and  legislation passing through the Executive to the Assembly.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I note the positive comments from the joint First  Ministers&rsquo; office that a significant offer has been made regarding a financial  package. However, I want to deal with the sunset clause. Many people in our  society will agree that the 2012 deadline creates an imperative for all Members  to try to secure agreement before that deadline. That is particularly important  because a local Minister will do a better job than a British Minister.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We must build confidence across society, because people  want a local Minister so that they can discuss the policy framework within  which policing and justice functions will reside. I reminded the SDLP both this  morning and the last time that we discussed the Bill in the Chamber that that  party flagged up the success of the sunset clause in the St Andrews Agreement,  which ensured that the DUP went into government by 26 March 2007. Although the  SDLP claimed &mdash; rightly or otherwise &mdash; the credit for that, it agreed in  principle to a sunset clause in the St Andrews Agreement. Therefore, one would  imagine that on such a crucial matter as policing and justice the SDLP would  today support the need for such a clause.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">However, I am mindful of the fact that members of the SDLP  might have changed their minds. The manifesto assertion that deals with the  sunset clause was made before the outgoing leader of the SDLP, in a speech in Oxford, talked about &ldquo;the  ugly scaffolding&rdquo; in the Good Friday Agreement around power sharing and  representativeness and about how that needed to be dismantled. I understand  what that said: some parties, including the SDLP, have difficulties with the  current arrangements for the appointment of a justice Minister. However, what  is proposed is a temporary measure. It is necessary to move the process  forward, and I believe that our people want to see us moving forward in a  positive and constructive way. It is our position that the allocation of the  ministerial position should revert to d&rsquo;Hondt post 2012, but all Members have a  lot of work to do between now and then.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will deal with the issue of the sunset clause.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Again, there are a number of private conversations going on  in the Chamber. It is distracting to me and to the Member who is on her feet.  Please desist, or go to another part of the Building.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat. I will deal with the issue of the sunset clause. The  provision for the British Secretary of State to impose a ministerial model of  policing and justice becomes spent once the Assembly passes an Act. That is a  fact, and the purpose of the powers as previously stated was to allow the  British Secretary of State to intervene to kick-start the transfer of powers.  That process falls away once the Assembly makes its own provisions. That is  precisely what we are doing today as part of that process. The precondition is  that the imposed solution addressed by an Order in Council will be taken  forward only if it appears to the British Secretary of State that there are no  reasonable prospects that the Assembly will pass an Act. However, an Act of  that kind is precisely what the Bill will achieve.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As Alex Maskey correctly stated earlier, the House of  Commons Hansard report of 4 May 2009 shows that Paul Goggins said:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Bill provides no fall-back position beyond May  2012. Frankly, it is not for us in this place&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">&mdash; Westminster  &mdash;</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;to determine any additional model beyond that  period&rdquo;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">He went on to say:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;There is no fall-back position&hellip;and it is entirely a  matter for the Assembly&hellip;It is important to know that central Government do not  have a major hand in determining what happens in a model beyond May 2012. That  is a matter entirely for the Assembly&rdquo;.</p>
      <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; font-size:12.0pt; ">The British of Secretary of State dealt with that matter  on 4 May 2009. The SDLP opposition to the Bill is dressed up as concern, but it  once again demonstrates the negative role that that party has played throughout  the political process of dealing with the transfer of policing and justice  powers. </span>
      <p class="B3BodyText">People want leadership from all the political parties in  the Chamber. People know who is leading and who is not. That is probably why  the SDLP has faced more than six electoral defeats.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP stated that, under the rules of democratic  inclusion, as the SDLP members call it, it is entitled to the position of  justice Minister. However, section 17 of the 1998 Act states:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;(4) The number of Ministerial offices shall not  exceed 10 or such greater number as the Secretary of State may by order  provide.</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">(5) A determination under subsection (1) shall not  have effect unless it is approved by a resolution of the Assembly passed with  cross-community support.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Section 18 of the 1998 Act states &mdash; this is very  important in the context of the SDLP amendments &mdash; that all Ministers shall  cease to hold office in the event of a resolution that causes one or more  ministerial offices to become vacant. Therefore, as has been said by other  Members, it is not a matter of an additional ministerial post being added on  through d&rsquo;Hondt. A total rerun of d&rsquo;Hondt would be required, and, therefore,  the Department of justice would be more likely to reside in unionist hands. I  concur with what Simon Hamilton said with regard to how the republican and  nationalist community would feel if a Minister for justice was from the  unionist community, regardless of whether that person was from the DUP or the  UUP.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We have a job of work to do to build confidence by 2012.  Confidence is a two-way street. We are not talking about the confidence of the  unionist community or some other community; our community, regardless of the  traditions of unionism or nationalism, needs confidence instilled in it.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Without doubt, the republican/nationalist community does  not want a justice Department to go to a unionist Minister at this time.  Hopefully, by 2012, we can build enough confidence across society so that  whoever is entitled to the justice Department gets it, allowing us to move  forward. Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP have said that they do not intend to nominate  and that they are prepared to set aside their party interest to show  leadership. People may try to make politics and say that one party is doing  that to keep the other party out, but that decision is about providing  leadership, which is what people want. They want to see that from all the political  parties, including the UUP, and, with particular reference to our community,  the SDLP.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We regard the transfer of policing and justice as more  important than one party or other holding a ministerial position. To be clear:  Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s preferred position is that the ministerial position go to the SDLP.  However, clause 2 allows us to get power back from Westminster into the hands of locally elected  politicians, and the people of our society want access to a local Minister.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In my constituency of Foyle, I have dealt with cases that  would be much easier if I could get access to a Minister here to discuss even  some of the concerns that emanate from my constituency to do with the justice  system, policy decisions that are taken and the policy framework within which  they are set. I am sure that that is the case for every Member.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is an appetite for a local Minister to be put in  place, but, as the SDLP stated, the first group of amendments is an attempt to  remove clause 2. However, the SDLP cannot handle the fact that clause 2 has  already been agreed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">On 18 November 2008, the Office of the First Minister and  deputy First Minister said that it had agreed on the transfer of policing and  justice, including the steps by which it would be achieved. It outlined how a  Minister of justice would be appointed: nominations would be invited from  Members and the successful candidate would require the support of the majority  of Members, present and voting, including a majority of designated nationalists  and a majority of designated unionists. That was accepted by the Assembly and  Executive Review Committee and was reflected in its report. As well as setting  out an arrangement for appointing the Minister, the Committee&rsquo;s report contained  recommendations to deal with the departmental structure and the powers that are  to be transferred.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">On 20 January 2009, the Assembly approved a motion that  endorsed the report. Therefore, clause 2 has been agreed by the Assembly and  Executive Review Committee, and the SDLP needs to explain better than it has  done today why it is trying to usurp and undermine that agreement. Perhaps it  is genuinely concerned from its own selfish political point of view that Sinn  F&eacute;in and the DUP will make further progress on a subject that the SDLP and the  UUP could not even discuss, let alone get to the advanced stage that it is with  us today.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Although I can accept the SDLP&rsquo;s political concerns, it  must show leadership on the issue and engage with people who are hungry for a  local Minister to whom they can have access and to whom we, as elected Members,  can have access to discuss our concerns about how the judiciary is working.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Arrangements for the appointment of a justice Minister  under clause 2 are interim measures. They would last until May 2012, at which  point the Department of justice would dissolve unless the Assembly were either  to extend those arrangements by resolution or to devise alternative  arrangements. That puts an onus on every Member in the Chamber to work to resolve  arrangements beyond 2012.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Before that date is reached, there will be an opportunity,  which was mentioned earlier by Simon Hamilton and other Members, to review the  ministerial arrangements that would have worked up to that point and to decide  then what is needed to move forward. If the Assembly supports the SDLP  amendments, it will remove that opportunity by imposing an unrealistic time  frame. Of course, no one wants to see the Department&rsquo;s dissolution in 2012.  That is precisely the incentive to agree permanent arrangements.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Despite what the SDLP has said incorrectly, there would be  no shortage of Assembly scrutiny of the process. The resolution that would  request the transfer of power would be debated and would require  cross-community support. The determination of ministerial offices would be  brought to the Chamber. The new justice Minister would be elected by the  Assembly with cross-community support.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">No matter what the SDLP says, the transfer of policing and  justice powers away from London  and into the hands of locally elected politicians is part of the St Andrews  Agreement; it is not an optional extra. It is also a British Government  obligation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">People demand a justice system that delivers. They want  access to a local Minister who is in charge of a Department of justice. They  are sick and tired of the revolving-door justice system that allows hoods and  thugs back onto the streets after they have been arrested. People want to be  able to go to a Minister to discuss the policy framework that allows that to  happen. They have had enough of seeing death drivers walk free on bail to  continue attacks in their communities.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">After the transfer of policing and justice powers to the  Assembly, the statutory framework that governs policies on what constitutes  crime and what appropriate penalties should be would become the responsibility  of the Assembly Minister. That is what society wants. Regardless of whether  they come from east Belfast  or the Bogside, that is what people demand and want.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Although we accept that certain issues need to be resolved,  we must use the time ahead to secure consensus. We must all try to ensure that  we work with each other&rsquo;s traditions and work together in the Chamber to show  the leadership that people expect and want from the Assembly.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The process is moving ahead. The SDLP and the UUP need to  face up to and deal with the choices that are in front of them. They can either  continue to ignore a political reality, or they can become involved in the  process. I hope that they do become involved, give that leadership, put  people&rsquo;s demands in front of party interests, and play a constructive and  meaningful role towards building the justice system that people throughout  society demand and deserve. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind Members that mobile phones should be switched off.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  For the record, Mr Deputy Speaker, my mobile phone is switched off. Just to  prove it, its wee light is off. I turned it off earlier when I became aware of  what was going on.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to speak first to amendments Nos 1 to 4, which deal  with one issue. Other colleagues have already spoken on them. I commend those  Members for highlighting the nonsense of those amendments, which, with respect  to the SDLP, are another failed attempt by that party to establish itself as  the opposition, despite the active role that it plays in the partnership  Government.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I cannot speak for the people who voted the SDLP into its  Assembly seats. I can speak only on behalf of my constituents. I speak with  full confidence that I am representing that majority when I say that the people  of the Province have been battered and bruised by years of conflict, broken  promises and neglect. For too long, we hoped for better days, to no avail. Now,  there is no doubt that we are emerging from the deepest darkness. I do not  dispute that for a second. However, it is a fool who learns nothing from the  past. We, in the DUP, are not fools.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">At the outset, let us get it straight that the effect of  amendment Nos 1 to 4 will be to shut down the sunset clause contained in the  Northern Ireland Act 2009. Ultimately, that clause is a torch in case the  lights do not come on and the Department of justice is a failure.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The sunset clause allows the Assembly the freedom to say  that the process has not worked and that it must start again. That provides an  essential assurance to the people of the Province that the Department of  justice is not set in stone. That fail-safe mechanism means that there is light  at the end of the tunnel.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have spoken to my constituents, and it is abundantly  clear that, despite their recognition of the need for a Department of justice,  they fear that knowledge and power may be given to those who may use it against  them and that those responsible for heinous crimes may benefit while moral and  upstanding people receive no redress. The only way to dissolve such genuine  fears is to build confidence slowly and to ensure that people are aware of the  existence of that fail-safe mechanism should their worst fears be realised.  That is why the DUP opposes the amendments.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly was set up not to railroad people but to represent  them and to ensure the best for the Province. It is not best for the Province  to steam ahead with no regard for people&rsquo;s opinions or for the justifiable  reluctance of some. The ability to start anew after a few years is essential to  the peace of mind of people in the Province. The DUP hopes to bring along the  majority of the people with it in supporting the legislation, and it is,  therefore, not possible to accept the amendments.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am known in my constituency as a people person, and that  may also apply to other Members. I speak in the Chamber not on my behalf but on  behalf of many members of the public. I listen to what people tell me, and I  take it on board. They tell me of the real fear that someone who has been  associated with terrorism may be able to control justice, and they say that  that could never be acceptable. The DUP makes that point clear on their behalf.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP sits in the Chamber with Sinn F&eacute;in today because  that party has a mandate. The turnabout of Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s position to public  support for the PSNI and other signs of change mean that the unionist people  have had to accept that, in a democracy, votes count. However, that does not  mean that we will accept someone in the role of justice Minister who has been  intimately affiliated with terrorism. Memories of the past have not been, and  will not be, forgotten. It is prudent and wise to learn from the past.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is, therefore, essential that clause 2 remains as is.  Were the DUP to accept the SDLP amendment, instead of a system requiring a  cross-community vote that incorporates a veto security lock, the appointment of  a Minister of justice would be left in the hands of the d&rsquo;Hondt system. For  many unionists, that would mean the end of their confidence not only in a  justice Minister and Department but in the Assembly as a whole. That is a  critical factor.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Province&rsquo;s unique history has left it in a unique  situation. We have suffered as no other country in the UK has  suffered, and the scars, mistrust and fear run deep. That is a natural result  of years of terrorism, and it is simply not realistic to expect people who have  been terrorised and abused for years to welcome a Bill that would allow for a  Minister of justice from the Sinn F&eacute;in Benches. It would be an insult to the  memory of those who suffered and made sacrifices to ensure that genuine justice  is achieved. The DUP will not allow it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is possible that the game playing in which the SDLP is  engaging today may cause the majority of people in the Province to lose faith  in the Assembly and its ability to govern Northern Ireland. When I read  amendment Nos 3 and 4, which seek to rush the process, I wonder exactly what  the SDLP seeks to achieve. It wants to apply pressure so that the system is in  place before the people are ready to trust and believe in it. That must not  happen, because unionist confidence is vital.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Members are here to represent, not railroad, the people. I  will have no part in what the SDLP is trying to achieve. The establishment of a  Department of justice and the appointment of a Minister of justice can come  about only when the electorate places sufficient trust in the process and the  system. At present, the people whom I represent have no confidence in the  d&rsquo;Hondt system and badly need reassurance that the appointment can happen only  with the approval of the largest unionist parties. The SDLP must consider what  the people whom it represents want. If they had wanted a Sinn F&eacute;in Minister in  charge, they would have voted for Sinn F&eacute;in instead of the SDLP. The SDLP would  do well to remember that it is the party that is playing games.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have a fair idea who voted for me, and I know that  cross-community voting happens in my constituency. I am more than satisfied  that I represent all my constituents when I say that the security of clause 2,  as it stands, is required. We are nowhere near reaching the level of trust  required for the SDLP amendment to be acceptable.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We cannot treat the Bill as if we were travelling in the  rush hour. If the people of the Province are not comfortable with the  arrangements being steamrolled through by the SDLP within seven days, there  cannot be a designated day or dissolution.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">This is a delicate business that must be treated with care  and consideration. Reading the proposed new clauses, I honestly do not know  what reality the SDLP is living in, but I know that it is not the one that the  rest of the Province faces daily. That is why I support the Bill but not the  amendments.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">5.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As a Member of the Committee for OFMDFM, I have sat through  evidence sessions on the Bill, and I have listened today to Alex Attwood defend  his stance on and reaction to the Bill. I know that he will not be entirely  convinced by what other Members have said in the Chamber.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I know for a fact that the people of the Province are  watching and listening to this debate with great interest. I reiterate the  point that we will ensure that controls and safety measures are in place and  that there is confidence in our ability to protect that position and the people  whom it represents. We will also ensure that the Bill is not steamrolled  through and that the appropriate measures are in place. In fact, we believe  that those are in place in the Bill already without the SDLP&rsquo;s changes, schemes  or amendments.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We have listened to our constituents, and we will abide by  what they want and need. They need the sunset clause and the cross-community  vote to apply to ensure safety. We will ensure that that happens. Our constituents  need us to dismiss the SDLP&rsquo;s amendments and to ensure that common sense and  wisdom prevail. We will do that, too. They need us to ensure that the process  is not rushed by unreal deadlines. That is what we will do.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">For the sake of the people of Northern Ireland, I ask the SDLP to  stop playing games and to do what it is elected to do. It must represent its  voters, who wanted it, not Sinn F&eacute;in, in a position of power. We need  devolution of policing and justice, but only at the right time and with the  right person at the helm. Rather than furthering the case for devolution, the  amendments do the opposite and, therefore, cannot be supported. I subsequently  support the Bill as it stands, and I oppose amendment Nos 1 to 4.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McFarland</strong>:  I declare membership of the Assembly and Executive Review Committee. I wish to  speak about clause 2 in particular, which Members on this side of the House  will be voting against. That is because the entire Bill is a back room deal  between the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in. My party was neither involved in nor consulted  on the Bill, which was pushed through the Committee by the two big parties.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  The Member said that this is a back room deal that he and his party were  completely unaware of. Was the Member not sitting three seats down from me  throughout the Assembly and Executive Review Committee&rsquo;s deliberations on this  issue and the proposals?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister (Mr P Robinson)</strong>: He was here during the Second Stage debate, too.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  As the First Minister pointed out, the Member also sat through the Second Stage  debate in the Chamber. Therefore, for him to say that he and his party are  unaware of what has been proposed is a complete and utter fallacy.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McFarland</strong>:  Mr Hamilton knows that the Member for Foyle made it clear in her speech earlier  that this came out of a deal that was done at St Andrews.  That is what she said, and she quoted bits and pieces of the sunset clause that  was agreed at St Andrews. The clause was  agreed between the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in at St Andrews. <em>[Interruption.]</em></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McFarland</strong>:  As everyone will recall, the deal then got stuck for 154 days before it was  unlocked when the First Minister and deputy First Minister came to the  Committee, at which the Member was present, and announced a 35-point plan that  they had agreed privately, without any reference to my party. Therefore, I am  correct in saying that this is a deal between the DUP and Sinn Fe&iacute;n.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McFarland</strong>:  No, I want to progress my argument a bit. <em>[Interruption.]</em></p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will give way in a minute, so I ask that the First  Minister bides his time.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 2 is a complete perversion of the system that is  used to elect Assembly Ministers. It is not for the benefit of the Assembly;  rather it is for the benefit of the First Minister and deputy First Minister,  who have dug themselves into a hole and are now trying to get out of it by  using this system.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is not the first time that the DUP, in particular, has  ended up interfering with Assembly procedures. We all know that the DUP, at St Andrews, messed around with the system for electing  the First Minister and deputy First Minister. That will, I suspect, lead to Mr  McGuinness being elected Prime Minister of Northern Ireland at the next  Assembly election. People need to remember that about the Democratic Unionist  Party.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: Will the Member tell the Assembly how the DUP messed around at St Andrews with the positions of the First Minister and  deputy First Minister? If the Member took the time to read the St Andrews  Agreement, he would see that it states that the position of First Minister goes  to the largest party in the largest designation.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McFarland</strong>:  The First Minister knows that, subsequent to the St Andrews Agreement and the  dealings around it, his party acquiesced &mdash; it did not die in a ditch, or object  &mdash; to a change that Sinn F&eacute;in very cleverly managed in agreement with the DUP.  That change was that the position of First Minister would, from then on, be  given to the largest party. Given the way in which the TUV is fracturing the  DUP, we will end up with three unionist parties, Sinn F&eacute;in as the largest  party, and Martin McGuinness as Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, thanks to  the DUP.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McFarland</strong>:  No; as the DUP keeps telling us, I must progress and move on.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We can see that the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in are fearful of each  other and that neither party is willing to take the justice Department.  However, the damage to the Assembly system by putting a Member from the  Alliance Party into the position of justice Minister is plain wrong.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Electorally, the Alliance Party is a tiny party, and it has  no right to the justice Ministry. It is sad, as has been mentioned, that the  Alliance Party is so ready to ditch the principled position of opposition that  we have heard so much about for the past two years. Almost the first thing that  Mrs Long said when the Assembly was formed in 2007 was that the rest of us were  in the Executive together, that the Alliance Party was the only party of  principle and the only party in opposition, and that it would hold the  Government to account. It is interesting that all that has been ditched. The  Alliance Party has sacrificed its principles to save Ulster.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 2 clearly shows that the justice Minister will be  selected &mdash; <em>[Interruption.] </em>Shush &mdash; <em>[Laughter.] </em>The justice  Minister will be selected and, if necessary, deselected by the First Minister  and deputy First Minister.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McFarland</strong>:  Yes, go on then. <em>[Laughter.]</em></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Will the Member clarify whether his party is against saving Ulster?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Given that his party has seats on the Executive, will the  Member clarify whether his party is part of the Government or is an opposition  party. The Alliance Party is clear that it is not in the Executive, and,  because of that, it plays the role of opposition. We have ambitions to win our  place in the Government, perhaps in the near future or some time in the future.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party never said that opposition is a party  principle. Good governance is a principle of the party, and we are happy to  play our role in providing that, whether outside the Executive or in the Government.  If the Alliance Party is in the Government, it will know that it is. Unlike the  Member&rsquo;s party, we will not be in the Government and in opposition at the same  time.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McFarland</strong>:  Jolly good: we have Her Majesty&rsquo;s principled opposition. Crack on.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is perhaps a bit strong to call the justice Minister a  puppet. However, the threat to remove that Minister if he or she does not  behave is real and will remain so. The ability of the two largest parties to  influence the justice Minister, even through a quiet word in the ear, exists.  No Minister should be put under such pressure.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP tells us that community confidence must be in place  before the devolution of policing and justice, and that the DUP is going to be  able to measure that confidence. If that is so, and if that confidence exists,  which will have to be the case before anybody moves forward, why can the  justice Minister not be a normal Minister and be elected by the d&rsquo;Hondt  mechanism?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  have listened to the Member&rsquo;s argument as it has progressed. He said that he  has no confidence in the Alliance Party taking the justice Ministry and that he  wants to run d&rsquo;Hondt. Does that mean that the Ulster Unionist Party thinks, as  it did in 2002, that Sinn F&eacute;in should be eligible to take the post of justice  Minister?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McFarland</strong>:  Sinn F&eacute;in has made it clear that it will not take the post, as has the DUP. Why  should Sinn F&eacute;in &mdash; <em>[Interruption.]</em></p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Let me kill this canard completely, because the DUP goes on  and on about it. If d&rsquo;Hondt is run, the largest party has first choice. The  largest party in the Assembly is the Democratic Unionist Party. If the  Democratic Unionist Party does not want to take the justice Ministry, that is  its choice as the largest party. If the DUP wants to give the Ministry to Sinn  F&eacute;in, that is its problem. Do not ask the Ulster Unionists about that.  Unfortunately, we are not the largest party in the Assembly, although the way  that the DUP is going, we may be again in the future.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Does the Member accept that he has illustrated the lack of confidence that  surrounds the devolution of policing and justice?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McFarland</strong>:  There seems to be a lack of confidence all round; there is caveat upon caveat upon  caveat.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I end my remarks on the group 1 amendments by making  reference to the sunset clause. The way we are going, the Minister of justice  will have two years in post at best. As it does not look as though there will  be agreement before Christmas, devolution will probably happen in the spring. A  date of May 2012 for closure on the matter gives the Minister two years in post  before he or she &mdash; presumably Lord Ford or Baroness Long &mdash; is removed. <em>[Interruption.]</em> Shush.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">What happens if the justice Minister is not re-elected in  2012? If you put all the questions together, it shows that the system is a daft  one to introduce when we have one that works perfectly well.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Alex Attwood covered the default system over the sunset  clause and the intervention that the Secretary of State will make when no  agreement can be found on the way ahead. The way things are going between the  DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in, agreement is unlikely before the next election. After the  election, the party positions may change. Why get into a situation of delayed  crisis in 2012 when the standard Assembly system could be adopted, regardless  of private agreements between the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in about not taking the job?  Why not run the d&rsquo;Hondt system and, if confidence exists, have a fully  operational Assembly right from the off?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is deeply flawed, and we will not support any  measure that damages the integrity of the Assembly.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>: I  support the group 1 amendments and oppose clause 2 standing part of the Bill.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Confidence has been talked about quite a lot in relation to  the devolution of justice and policing. Inside and outside the Chamber, there  has been much emphasis on the necessary confidence that people need before the  devolution of policing and justice powers can take place. People want to have  confidence, not just on matters now but on matters in the future. People want  to have confidence in the budget situation, not just for the next two years but  for the years ahead. People want confidence and assurance on the operational  independence of the Chief Constable, although some of those who are insisting  on it have been trying to put pressure on the operational independence of the  Chief Constable by introducing various preconditions in our deliberations this  week. Nevertheless, confidence is an issue not only for the short term but for  the long term.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">5.30 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In the past, parties have said that, in their experience  and interpretation, one reason why the devolution of justice and policing  should not be rushed is that people need to gain confidence in these  institutions and that the building of such confidence would provide grounds for  confidence in the devolution of justice and policing. On the basis of the issue  of confidence, which has been stressed so emphatically by many other parties,  we have tabled the amendments, which go to the core of an issue that projects a  serious lack of confidence and creates serious grounds for concern: the  so-called sunset clause that was built into the Northern Ireland Act 2009,  which was passed in Westminster.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That clause states that the Department of justice, which  will be created on the basis of public confidence in 2009 or 2010, will  automatically dissolve on 1 May 2012 if there is no agreement to continue the  current arrangement, which we are told is an interim arrange&shy;ment that is  proposed in the Bill. However, the Bill provides that the interim arrangement  might be the long-term arrangement. We must agree to that if we are to prevent  the dissolution of the Department of justice in May 2012. Alternatively, we can  agree to another model from the menu that was provided by Secretaries of State  in various pieces of legislation. That will prevent dissolution in 2012. Of  course, we could agree to use d&rsquo;Hondt.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Our amendments would ensure that, at this time, the  Assembly has the option to still use d&rsquo;Hondt for the appointment of the first  devolved justice Minister and not rely solely on election by cross-community  vote. Our amendments do not absolutely exclude the possibility that parties  will use their numbers in the Assembly to have an election by cross-community  vote. They mean that we will retain the possibility of electing by d&rsquo;Hondt if  the Assembly, on the basis of the statements and reports that would be made by  the First Minister and the deputy First Minister, has the confidence to go that  way.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 2 creates the obligation on the First Minister  and the deputy First Minister to report to the House. It would allow the First  Minister and the deputy First Minister to demonstrate and advertise political  and public confidence in the prospects for the devolution of justice and  policing.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  Will the Member provide clarity: if the Ministry of justice falls in 2012,  where will the powers be designated?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  The Member moves me to a topic that is slightly astray from where I want to be.  We do not know the answer. That is one reason why the First Minister and the  deputy First Minister should make a statement to that effect. When we raised  those questions previously, we were told that we were wrong, that there is  absolutely no fallback or that the Secretary of State would not use the  fallback that might exist. The reality is that the nature of the fallback in  paragraph 8 of schedule 1 to the Northern Ireland Act 2009, which was passed in  Westminster,  means that the Secretary of State will impose a model for the Ministry.  However, that model of a Minister and a deputy Minister would still require an  election in the House. Even if there is a fallback, Ministers might not be  appointed.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  The Member is providing a lot of conjecture about what might be a fallback.  Will he tell us whether there is a fallback position and, if so, what it is? He  argues that there is a fallback position, but he cannot tell us what it is. On  the other hand, his party says that we face grave consequences because there is  no fallback. Will he clarify his position?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>: I  thank the Member for his point. We have clarified that, but the confusion is in  the position that the Member and his party are defending &mdash; a position that will  be in the Bill, combined with the twin Westminster  legislation. At the Bill&rsquo;s Second Stage, Alex Maskey said emphatically that  there was no fallback but, at my invitation, in a later intervention, John  O&rsquo;Dowd said that of course there was a fallback and that, sensibly, there had  to be one.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The contradictions and the riddles are in Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s  position. One the one hand it says that there is no fallback; it makes a virtue  of saying that the sunset clause has absolutely no fallback and that it is  curtains if nothing else is agreed. On the other hand, John O&rsquo;Dowd insisted at  Second Stage that there has to be a fallback. Now Sinn F&eacute;in is saying again  that there is no fallback.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">From the DUP Benches, we heard the First Minister say that  it could be argued that paragraph 8(3) of schedule 1 to the Northern Ireland  Act 2009 provides a fallback for the Secretary of State to impose a model for  appointing a Minister of justice and a deputy Minister of justice after 2012  but that he thought that it would be politically unlikely that a Secretary of  State would use such powers. Legislatively and theoretically, there could well  be a fallback, but whether that is politically feasible is seriously open to  question.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The question for us as legislators is whether any of that  is satisfactory. We should be saying that the confusion about whether there is  a fallback or whether a notional fallback is politically feasible and achievable  is, from our point of view as legislators, simply not good enough. The  devolution of policing and justice is so fundamentally important that we should  not leave it on a wing and a prayer, against all the vicissitudes, vagaries and  try-ons that could be used in the run down to the 2012 deadline for the  dissolution of the justice Department. The Sinn F&eacute;in, DUP and Alliance Party Members  are defending the twin Westminster  legislation. They are saying that the sunset clause that dissolves the justice  Department in May 2012 is a good thing.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">To all the people who are defending the dissolution of the  justice Department in 2012, what does that mean? It means that the Department  will cease to be, but the Minister will not. Perhaps we do not have a problem,  so long as we have a Minister. However, as Alex Attwood pointed out, under our system,  with the exception of a few laws that make specific reference to the Minister  of Finance and Personnel, the power and authority are vested in the Department.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">When the Department ceases, what happens to its various  functions? Members have decried the list of interests that Alex Attwood  mentioned, such as the Prison Service. The Prison Service does not exist as a  non-departmental body; as it stands, it is simply part of the NIO. On the basis  of everything that we have been told by the First Minister and the deputy First  Minister, the functions that are intended to be transferred will be part of the  Department of justice. As things currently stand, that is where the Prison  Service will be. If the Department of justice is dissolved, what will happen to  the Prison Service? The same applies to the Youth Justice Agency; it will be in  exactly the same position. It is part of the NIO; it is not a Next Steps agency  or a non-departmental public body. The Compensation Agency and Forensic Science  Northern Ireland  are in a similar position; they would be integral parts of the Department of  justice that would be dissolved.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The people who insist on the need for confidence and  certainty for the future are the people who are giving us this legislation.  They say that it is a good enough basis for them. They say that it will be all  right. They do not care about the difficulties that there were when the  Executive did not meet, the big ticket issues or the strategic issues that we  could not agree on, that we are disagreeing on and that we are running into the  ground. They are confident that everything will be worked out just fine, just  in time by May 2012. Who seriously believes that? If there are going to be  difficulties in May 2012, is it not better to ensure that we do not get there  in the first place by making sure that we do not rely on such a dangerous  device or ensuring that, in the absence of agreement, there is a safe, clear,  known fallback? Our amendments would provide that the safe, known, absolutely  reliable fallback in 2012 would be d&rsquo;Hondt.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Martina Anderson said that Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s preference is a return  to d&rsquo;Hondt in 2012. If Sinn F&eacute;in really believed that, it would support our  amendments. Our amendments would stipulate that, by law, we would revert to  d&rsquo;Hondt in May 2012 if other issues were not agreed. If Sinn F&eacute;in wants to be  believed on that, it can prove it by supporting our amendments. Of course,  nobody believes Sinn F&eacute;in on that.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  The Member says that nobody believes Sinn F&eacute;in. I think that you will find that  the vast majority of the nationalist, republican electorate believe Sinn F&eacute;in.  Let us not have such sweeping comments. In relation to a number of points that  you are making, I have sat through several hours &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to refer all his remarks through the Chair.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  was following the example set by the First Minister earlier, but I will take my  lead from the Deputy Speaker.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. You are questioning my ruling, Mr O&rsquo;Dowd. When the First  Minister spoke, he did not use the word &ldquo;you&rdquo;; he referred his remarks through  the Chair, and I ask that you do the same.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  am always enlightened by the Deputy Speaker. As for the SDLP amendments and  contributions, they seem to base their arguments on the premise that Armageddon  will commence if agreement is not reached within 30 months. However, their amendments  state that, if agreement is not reached within 14 days of the devolution of  policing and justice, Armageddon will commence. I would much prefer to place my  bet on a 30-month timescale than a 14-day one. I believe that we can achieve  agreement. It is not guaranteed &mdash; nothing is guaranteed in life, especially not  in politics &mdash; but I am sure that agreement will not be reached within 14 days.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  The Member seems to be referring to amendment No 3 when he raises the issue of  14 days. Amendment No 3 would provide that, within 14 days of the relevant  date, if the Assembly has not received the report by the First Minister and  deputy First Minister that would be required by amendment No 2 and if the Assembly  has not voted to appoint a Minister by cross-community vote, a Minister would  be appointed through the d&rsquo;Hondt mechanism. It would not be Armageddon; nothing  would stop. The process would move on.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 3 would provide that we would know within 14  days that the election would either be by cross-community vote, which some  Members appear to favour, or by d&rsquo;Hondt. Our amendment would allow everyone who  supports d&rsquo;Hondt, both now and in the future, if it is departed from in the  short term, to fully do so. Equally, it would allow those who still insist that  a justice Minister could be elected only by a cross-community vote to do so.  The amendments would not prevent the first devolved justice Minister from being  appointed by cross-community vote; they would ensure that d&rsquo;Hondt would still  be an option.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The test is that the First Minister and deputy First  Minister come before the Assembly to deal with the issue of the target date of  May 2012. The First Minister and deputy First Minister gave us the sunset  clause. We did not ask for or seek it. They said that the devolution of  policing and justice would occur on the basis that the Department would be  dissolved in May 2012. Sinn F&eacute;in is telling the nationalist community that it  will really put it up to the DUP and will insist on terms, because there is no  fallback otherwise. That will end up in a serious game of chicken that will go  right down to the wire. The Assembly has the right to know whether that is  happening. We cannot pretend that there are not all sorts of political games  going on in what Members are telling their electorate and saying what each  clause means or does not mean. We cannot pretend that Members are not telling  people in their backwoods that there is a fallback, that there really is a way  around this and that the sunset clause is not a bad thing.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">5.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As a competent legislature and Chamber of accountability,  we have a right to demand clarity and openness if different sections of the  community are being given different assurances. It is a legislature&rsquo;s job to  know the basis on which legislation is being adopted. That basis must not be  confounded later by all sorts of other interpretations and hidden  understandings.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  There has been much conjecture about the nature of the fallback position. Some  people claim that there is no fallback position, but the Member tells us that  there definitely is. However, no one other than the First Minister and deputy  First Minister has said that they have agreement to do anything until May 2012.  It has been stated clearly that there is no agreement on what to do beyond May  2012. Will the Member tell us whether his party can get agreement with anybody  here to take matters forward until 2012, never mind beyond that date?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not know what the Member needs to hear for the  situation to be clearer to him. Agreement has been reached to transfer powers  if we can agree a date between now and May 2012. There is no agreement beyond  that date; there must be agreement by May 2012 if the matter is to be taken  forward. The sunset clause is in the Bill to ensure that people&rsquo;s minds are  concentrated. Will the Member tell the House with whom his party will get  agreement to take devolution forward tomorrow, next week or at some other stage  within 14 days if the amendment is agreed? He has not told the House of a  single way in which his party can take matters forward.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  The Member is entirely wrong, and, not for the first time, he made a statement  that distracts and misrepresents. The Member said that there is agreement on  how to deal with these matters until 2012. Of course there is agreement between  Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP on how to deal with these matters until 2012 and on how  to shaft the SDLP. There is agreement on how to depart from the rules of  inclusion according to democratic mandate, show patronage to one party and  discriminate against another that has a democratic entitlement. I resent that  agreement between Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP, but I am not jealous of it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier, the Member decried the fact that the UUP will  support some of the SDLP amendments but not others. I have no qualms about  agreeing with another party where possible, but we will always retain our  position. Unfortunately, when Sinn F&eacute;in agrees with the DUP, it ends up  adopting the DUP&rsquo;s position. I am proud that we have not adopted the UUP&rsquo;s  position of not wanting a deadline or target date for devolution. We do, and  that is our clear position. We have not surrendered our position or been  distracted from it for the sake of agreement with the UUP or any other party.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in claims to believe in inclusion under d&rsquo;Hondt, but  it has departed from that position completely. Where did the deadline of May  2012 and the sunset clause come from? The sunset clause was the fig leaf that  Sinn F&eacute;in produced in desperation to over up the fact that, in July 2008, the  deputy First Minister agreed with the First Minister that the justice Ministry  would be established on the basis of a cross-community vote at all times. In  our recent talks, the DUP boasted that it had a permanent veto and would be  able to use that to veto any Sinn F&eacute;in Minister. The DUP also told us that it  may agree to a member of the SDLP being appointed Minister of justice at some  stage &mdash; that was nice of them &mdash; but its main point was that it would  permanently be able to veto anyone from Sinn F&eacute;in being appointed Minister. It  was only when we pointed out the folly of Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s negotiation and its  concession to depart from d&rsquo;Hondt and democratic inclusion for this post, not  just temporarily or for the first appointment but for all time and in  perpetuity, that Sinn F&eacute;in desperately tried to recover its position.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">When we pointed out Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s folly, the First Minister  asked us to ease off because the process was going nicely for the DUP. He told  us that difficulties had been created only because we had alerted Sinn F&eacute;in to  the problem. Perhaps we contributed to making sure that Sinn F&eacute;in saved itself,  to a degree, from its mistakes.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">However, its answer has given the rest of us a serious  problem because of the effect of the sunset clause as it is framed. We did not  frame it in that way; we did not invite the threatened dissolution of the  Department. The fact is that, as things stand, the dissolution of the  Department will have fundamental implications, not for the Police Service of  Northern Ireland &mdash; it is constituted outside of the Department and has a  separate legal constitution &mdash; but for the Prison Service, the Youth Justice  Agency, the Compensation Agency and Forensic Science Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We are told that that situation will not come to pass. I  really hope not. All of us will have to work very hard to make sure that that  does not come to pass in those terms. All of us will have to make every effort,  because we cannot afford it. However, whether all of us will be allowed to play  a role in that regard is another matter because, as we have seen in a large  part of this process, we are told that we have responsibilities but that we  have to wait until we get the call, cue or invitation before we are able to say  or address anything that is relevant to our responsibilities. Sometimes the  rest of us only get a role in trying to unravel some of the problems and  difficulties and in trying to unhook people from some of the hooks onto which  they have climbed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If things can be done to avoid having an impasse in 2012,  let us do them. The first thing that we could do is correct this legislation.  That would help. We could make sure that we have an option now, in the short  term, so that we do not have to go only by the cross-community-vote,  departing-from-the-agreement route; or we could make sure that, as a way out of  the dissolution crisis that we could face in 2012, we would have the safe  fallback of d&rsquo;Hondt.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">People tell us that we should think positively about this  process and that we should forget all the experiences of the past two and a  half years and have wonderful expectations of the next two and a half years.  That is great; I hope that it is all sweetness and light and Shangri-La in May  2012. However, if people are so confident that it will be so good and will all  work very well and very positively, why not have d&rsquo;Hondt as the fallback? The  danger is that, by having the device of the sunset clause with the dissolution  of the Department, we are creating a temptation for parties to play chicken, to  use leverage, to manipulate things, to grandstand and to barter on other  issues.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Even this week, we have seen how an issue like the  devolution of justice and policing is being used to gain leverage and purchase  on all sorts of other issues that are completely unrelated, hardly related or,  in some cases, are being quite dangerously interrelated in a way that is  unwarranted. When we know how people use those devices to create trouble and  difficulties and to create stand-offs and all sorts of stand-and-deliver  tactics, why so casually legislate again for that on a matter such as this?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Everything that I have said so far has related very much to  the issue of the Department. I listened to Naomi Long from the Alliance Party  and somebody from Sinn F&eacute;in trying to say that the SDLP goes on about the  Minister as though it is its Ministry and that people are not talking about the  Department. The questions that I have raised are about the Department and its  role and stability. We cannot say that this legislation absolutely guarantees  the stability of the Department, because it is the one Department whose  dissolution is legislated for. If we want to have confidence to say that its  stability is guaranteed, we should be addressing these issues. That is what our  amendments are about.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not believe that it would be too tall an order for the  First Minister and deputy First Minister to make the sort of report that is  requested in proposed clause 2A, which would require them to come to this House  and soberly, clearly and plainly address those issues on the basis of the best  legal and Government advice.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not doubt the capacity of the House to make the  judgements that must be made within a week or two weeks, conscious of the  parties&rsquo; voting strengths. Thus, despite people trying to say, as Simon  Hamilton did, that we are not being &ldquo;real&rdquo; politically, the fact is that we are  being very real politically about where the balance of forces lies in the  House. However, we are trying to take at their word people who say that they  still want d&rsquo;Hondt; the amendment gives them the chance for that, either in the  near future or by 2012. Similarly, the amendment gives those who say that they  are concerned about stability, about ensuring that there is confidence and  about making sure that the Department is durable a way of avoiding the very  dangerous, potentially nightmarish, sunset clause.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Regardless of which party nominates for the position of  justice Minister or what means of appointment is used &mdash; d&rsquo;Hondt or  cross-community vote &mdash; May 2012 may not be the first test of that Minister&rsquo;s  position. An Assembly election is scheduled for May 2011 but may take place  sooner. The Minister may or may not be re-elected to the subsequent Assembly.  Whether or not the Minister is re-elected, a cross-community vote will still be  required for the election of a justice Minister in the new Assembly.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">After the Assembly election, parties will be thinking very  seriously about the May 2012 sunset clause. Therefore, while the parties  negotiate the formation of the Government, how to run d&rsquo;Hondt and the Programme  for Government, there will inevitably be negotiations about who should be  elected as the justice Minister by cross-community vote. Parties will be  tempted to front up some issues in relation to May 2012, and, in those  circumstances, they might be naive not to indicate some of their ambitions and  intentions in respect of May 2012.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Hence, it might well be that after the Assembly election we  wait some time before we appoint a Minister, because the relevant 2009  Westminster legislation provides that the Executive can be formed on the basis  of running d&rsquo;Hondt for all the other ministerial posts. The Executive can be  formed on the basis of the First and the deputy First Minister being appointed  and all the other posts being filled. The Executive can continue without the  justice portfolio being allocated.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">At least after May 2011, there would be a justice  Department and there would not be a question mark over the Prison Service, the  Compensation Agency and the Youth Justice Agency. In those circumstances, there  would be a Department without a Minister, whereas in May 2012, we could  potentially have a Minister without a Department. Therefore, under the Bill&rsquo;s  current provisions, we may not have to wait until May 2012 before difficulties  emerge and games of chicken are played.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  The Member is indicating that the legislation, as it is currently penned, is  not competent. His argument is that the legislation could create the scenario  of having a Minister but no Department. Surely, as the report went through the  Assembly and Executive Review Committee, the Assembly and Westminster and is  now back in the Assembly, some of the highly qualified individuals in all those  places would have copped on that we were putting legislation that is not  competent through Westminster and the Assembly. However, the Member is telling  us that the legal eagles in his Front Bench have spotted it, revealed it and  are now bringing it to the public&rsquo;s attention.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>: I  advise the Member that this is not a recent discovery. When the legislation was  going through Westminster,  I and others pointed out that issue, and the Government did not contest it. The  Government did not contest that that scenario would be the effect of  dissolution. The only thing that the Member, because he is not contesting &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Is it in order for the Assembly to  debate or discuss legislation that is not competent?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The legislation that is in front of the Assembly, Mr O&rsquo;Dowd, has  been deemed by the Speaker to be competent.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">6.00 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>: I  am not the first Member to refer to the sunset clause, which is also part of  the twin legislation in Westminster  that, similarly, provides for a departure from d&rsquo;Hondt. In the Second Stage  debate and today, Sinn F&eacute;in strongly relied on and invoked the sunset clause,  and it talked about there being no fallback position.</p>
      <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Dallat] in the Chair)</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The sunset clause deals with the Department&rsquo;s dissolution:  it does not address whether there will be a Minister or not, so the position  seems to be that there could be a named Minister in limbo with no Department.  Of course, the twin Westminster  legislation also ensures that, in the event of an election, the Assembly&rsquo;s  failure to elect a justice Minister by cross-community vote will not prevent the  Executive being formed and the other Ministers being appointed to discharge  their duties. Therefore, the scenario has been legislated for.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I did not write the legislation: other parties supported it  and said that it is all about generating confidence, certainty and stability.  Nevertheless, in 2011, we could end up with a Department without a Minister for  a long time, when other Ministers will have been appointed and will be doing  their business. In 2012, we could end up with no justice Department but with a  notional Minister floating in the ether like a lost boy or girl in a strange  land. Mr O&rsquo;Dowd may be right to question whether that legislation is competent  and sensible. For a lay person, it does not seem like a competent or sensible  way to govern; however, it is the way chosen by Sinn F&eacute;in, the DUP and the  British Government.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The substantive reason for clause 2 is to gerrymander the  appointment of the Minister; it is the provision to bypass the laid-down rule  for democratic inclusion and proportional representation in the Executive. I  agree with Naomi Long: the d&rsquo;Hondt mechanism is not the only mathematical  formula that can be used to effect democratic inclusion. However, rightly or  wrongly, it is the only one set down in the Agreement and in the Northern  Ireland Act 1998. Others mechanisms may be favoured, and, during the talks, we  canvassed for others, but we had no takers for any of them. Some parties liked  the d&rsquo;Hondt mechanism either because they had experience of it in the European  Parliament or because they had suggested in proposals and talks in previous  Assemblies that it would be a good way to share committee positions. However,  there was no interest in other mechanisms, such as the Sainte-Lagu&euml; system. We  have no problem with looking at those sorts of things in the context of a  properly constituted review of the Agreement and based on the principle that it  is about a finding means of democratic inclusion. We do not, however, entertain  the idea of abandoning d&rsquo;Hondt in favour of anything like voluntary coalition.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Contrary to what Martina Anderson said, the SDLP has been  clear and consistent about what I said in the speech that I made in Oxford, when I robustly  defended d&rsquo;Hondt both now and in the future. I also roundly condemned Sinn F&eacute;in  for departing from d&rsquo;Hondt in respect of the justice Ministry and for being  prepared to completely abandon the principle of inclusion by democratic mandate  in the comprehensive agreement in 2004, when Sinn F&eacute;in insisted that parties  had to vote for First Minister and deputy First Minister if they wanted to be  included in Government.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Consequently, the SDLP and UUP would have been excluded had  they not voted for DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in candidates for First Minister and deputy  First Minister. It was only the SDLP&rsquo;s talks with the DUP before the St Andrews  Agreement that prevented that from happening. The position of Sinn F&eacute;in, the  British Government and the Irish Government was that inclusion would not be by  democratic mandate; rather, parties would only be included if they submitted  their mandate to the parties of the First Minister or the deputy First  Minister. When the SDLP was negotiating d&rsquo;Hondt in the Agreement, it negotiated  true inclusion, not just for itself or with traps to get other parties to  exclude themselves. Of course, when Sinn F&eacute;in was doing it, it did so to suit  itself, and to hell with anybody else, even other nationalists.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">No one else had democratic rights unless they bowed the  knee to Sinn F&eacute;in. I am proud of the fact that the SDLP stood for inclusion according  to mandate. That is why we stand by it now. We would stand by that principle  regardless of which party found itself in this predicament or which was to be  the victim of this deviation from the norm.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We are given nonsense explanations as to why this should  not be the norm. Yet again, Martina Anderson misquoted section 17 of the Act  and particularly subsection 4. Section 17 of the Act states that for there to  be more than 10 Departments, consent must be given by the Secretary of State.  That applies even now; it applies to the method, the Bill, that other Members  are supporting. The approval of the Secretary of State is needed. <em>[Interruption.]</em></p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Alex Maskey says that the SDLP is looking for a way that  needs the consent of the Secretary of State, but the way that Sinn F&eacute;in is  going needs the consent of the Secretary of State. For there to be an extra  Department, consent must be given by the Secretary of State. <em>[Interruption.]</em></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Remarks must be made through the Chair.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>: I  want to make the point to Mr Maskey that the creation of an extra Department to  bring the number of Departments to more than 10 needs the agreement of the  Assembly on a cross-community vote. That is the point on which Martina Anderson  misquotes section 17(4) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998. She said that section  17(4) means that if there is going to be an extra Department, the Minister must  be elected by cross-community vote. Such a presentation is a sleight of hand.  The cross-community vote is required only to agree that there should be an  extra Department, beyond the total of 10. The Secretary of State&rsquo;s consent is  required as well. That condition applies if the appointment is by d&rsquo;Hondt, and  it applies equally to this Bill, which is the way that Sinn F&eacute;in has chosen.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. Will the Member confirm that, whatever about  having to go to the Secretary of State, these decisions require agreement  between people here before we go anywhere? If that is the case and the Member  accepts that, can he tell us with whom he can get agreement about any of this?  He has not told the House that.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  That is what we are in the business of doing here by way of this legislation.  It is what we are trying to do in the Assembly and Executive Review Committee.  However, those are not genuine all-party negotiations for two reasons: there  are questions as to how well all parties are represented in those discussions,  and also because those discussions are confined &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  On a point of order, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Is it in order for the Member to  question the integrity of the Assembly and Executive Review Committee? That is  what the Member has just done. That is a fundamental question that must be  addressed by you, as Deputy Speaker. It is a serious statement to make.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I leave it to the Member to explain.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  Allow me to clarify: I said that one could not call the Assembly and Executive  Review Committee an all-party negotiation because, first, there is a question  as to how well-represented all the parties are. Is the Member saying that all  parties are on that Committee? They are not. That is a limitation of the  Assembly and Executive Review Committee. <em>[Interruption.]</em></p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, that Committee finds itself constrained because  some things are subject to determination, decision and cues from the First Minister  and the deputy First Minister. A lot of these matters were already  pre-determined according to the very flawed negotiations that took place  between the First Minister and the deputy First Minister. Indeed, that is where  the sunset clause came from; it was an attempt to unravel some of that damage.  Therefore, the Assembly and Executive Review Committee has not been getting an  entirely free run on those issues.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That is where we see the &ldquo;now you see it, now you don&rsquo;t&rdquo;  game from Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP. Sometimes it is all just them, and aren&rsquo;t they  the boys? It is just the two of them, and they can do everything together.  Suddenly, at other times, it is everybody: all parties have responsibility and  we are all involved. They speak with forked tongues and are two-faced in so  many ways. Those parties are responsible for the inconsistencies and  contradictions.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The reason that the SDLP opposes clauses 2 &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I again ask you to reflect on the  Hansard report of the debate, because the Member has clearly stated that Sinn  F&eacute;in and one other party are speaking with forked tongues. Is that appropriate  language for a debate in the Chamber? It is a serious allegation, and the  Member may well have lost the run of himself because he has forgotten where he  is.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I did not hear anything that was unparliamentary, but part of the  reason for that might be that Members are ignoring the Chair and are not  conducting themselves in the fashion that I expect. If Members speak through  the Chair I will have a better chance of hearing what is being said.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>: I  want to address some points that Members made in opposing the amendments  proposed by Alex Attwood. Members have questioned our position and suggested  that we said that the Minister of justice post is ours and ours alone and that  no other party should get it. During the Second Stage debate on the Bill and in  the meetings that the SDLP held with the First Minister and the deputy First  Minister, I said that the best course to follow was to create a Department of  justice from within the existing 10 Departments; after all, the DUP has told  the House that it already thinks that there are too many Departments, yet it  wants to create another one.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Under the Northern Ireland Act 1998, it is feasible to rejig  or merge Departments and create a Department of justice: it can be done. The  First Minister and the deputy First Minister can put such proposals to the  House and have them passed by cross-community vote. Therefore, contrary to what  Naomi Long said earlier, it is entirely within the competence of the House to  vote and ensure that we stay within the 10 Department limit. The First Minister  and the deputy First Minister could have used their powers to do that and could  have run the d&rsquo;Hondt process. As such, it would neither have been the SDLP  claiming that the justice Ministry was its entitlement, nor would it have been  a departure from d&rsquo;Hondt or the Good Friday Agreement. Rather than Members  saying that the SDLP&rsquo;s purpose was to bag the justice Ministry and that no  other parties could have that Ministry; that was the way to go. That way is  open, and the SDLP has pointed it out on several occasions.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: I  appreciate that the Member may have been consistent in his personal position.  However, the issue that I raised was not that it was outside the competence of  the Assembly to create a Department of justice from within the 10 existing  Departments; it was that it was not politically feasible to do so. <em>[Interruption.]</em></p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Again, the Member is speaking from a sedentary position.  There is no agreement to create that Department from within the existing 10  Departments. Furthermore, although the Member has been consistent; his party  colleagues have not. Today, SDLP Members made interventions claiming that they  were entitled to the justice Ministry, not just an eleventh Ministry, and  stated that the d&rsquo;Hondt process should be used for the appointment of the  Minister of justice. The Member may be consistent but there is no consistency  in his party.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>: I  appreciate that intervention and I will reply to it. The Member said that it  would not be politically feasible to absorb the justice Ministry into the  existing 10 Departments. Why not? It was politically feasible for the First  Minister, when he came back from Florida,  to say that he was going to kill dead things and reduce the number of  Departments. If that is politically feasible, why is it not politically  feasible to create a Department of justice from within the existing 10  Departments? There is no reason why it would not be feasible: the fact is that  parties were not tested on it. The only party that canvassed that position was  the SDLP.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: I  was present when the First Minister made the speech on his return from Florida, when he stated  that he wanted to reduce the number of Departments. However, I ask the Member:  has that happened? Has the First Minister been able to affect that change? He  has not, because he would require more than just his own opinion to do so: the  weight of his views would have to be carried by the House.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is one thing to talk about it; it is quite another thing  to do it. The Department of justice could not have been delivered from within  the 10 existing Departments because there would not have been agreement to do  that. That is the point that has been made today.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">6.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind Members to focus their attention on the amendments under  discussion.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  We are speaking to clause 2 stand part as well as to the amendments, Mr Deputy  Speaker, and that is why some of those issues are relevant. Members have been  questioning whether d&rsquo;Hondt is a viable option and asking what running d&rsquo;Hondt  as specified in the Good Friday Agreement would mean. It is pertinent to  address those issues, particularly given that the SDLP position was questioned  and misrepresented at great will earlier in the debate. Therefore, we have to  be allowed some room to counter and to account for ourselves. It would also  demonstrate consistency.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, to have the justice Department as one of 10  Departments would have been a feasible option. There is no reason that that  should not have been proposed, thought about or discussed. The SDLP certainly  did that. We made it clear in various conversations that that was our position,  not just recently, but going back to last year, when we had conversations with  the DUP on the third floor of this Building. Of course, the party then said  that that could not be its position. The DUP could not afford to agree to run  d&rsquo;Hondt for the justice portfolio because that would mean that it could not  exercise a veto. That is it, plain and simple.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP advocated that position all along. However, the  DUP, for all its claims that it is worried about the cost of government and  about having too many Departments, is insisting on creating an extra Department  for its own political necessity and to be devious. That proves the hypocrisy  and humbug of the DUP. It says that we do not need 10 Departments, yet it is  making damned sure &mdash; sorry, Mr Deputy Speaker, darn sure &mdash; that we get 11  Departments, not including the Office of the First Minister and deputy First  Minister. That is another example of doublespeak, or whatever parliamentary  term accords with forked tongue, two faces, and so on.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If we are not to run d&rsquo;Hondt for the justice portfolio as  one of 10 Departments and there is to be an additional Department &mdash; the  Secretary of State&rsquo;s consent and cross-community support in the House is  required for that &mdash; in order to be consistent with the Good Friday Agreement  and the 1998 Act, d&rsquo;Hondt should be rerun to take in the justice portfolio. The  SDLP is open to that. However, we gathered very quickly that the view of other  parties was that a rerun of d&rsquo;Hondt would be too disruptive to other Ministers,  could lead to speculation games on policies and could disrupt the Programme for  Government.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If other parties are agreeing to there being 11 Departments  but that ministerial posts cannot be filled through rerunning d&rsquo;Hondt, two  things can happen. First, d&rsquo;Hondt could be rerun with all the parties agreeing  the order in which they are nominating Ministers. Remember, that has happened  before. Parties had agreed their choices in advance of d&rsquo;Hondt&rsquo;s being run in  the Chamber in 2007. A dry run of d&rsquo;Hondt had taken place, and parties were  free to change their choices if they wanted in the Chamber, but that would have  been in defiance of an agreement that they had reached. Legally and  technically, however, it would have been within parties&rsquo; rights to do that.  Therefore, parties could reach an all-party agreement to let d&rsquo;Hondt run and  let the justice portfolio be the eleventh choice.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, on the basis that Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP have said  that they are not taking up the post, d&rsquo;Hondt could be run in the knowledge  that the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in are going to pass up on the post, and it would then  depend on whether the Ulster Unionist Party nominated first to the position or  the SDLP did. D&rsquo;Hondt would be run, consistent with the agreement.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, Martina Anderson tells us that that is the great  &ldquo;Ha ha&rdquo; &mdash; the great &ldquo;Gotcha&rdquo; &mdash; to the SDLP position, because such a scenario  would allow unionists to nominate the justice Minister. Well, d&rsquo;Hondt is run  for the justice portfolio, it is according to the principle of democratic  inclusion. That is the agreement for which the Irish people voted, and if we  have confidence in the agreement and our institutions, that is that. We are not  saying that for a unionist to hold the post is the worst thing in the world.  Therefore, it seems strange that Martina Anderson and her party are trying to  say that a great confidence is breaking out, that there will be a brave new  world, that there is no question of there being any difficulties with the May  2012 date, and all the rest of it, while at the same time insisting that a  unionist not be allowed to take the position and stating that the SDLP might  have entertained a unionist in the role.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There are ways in which to handle the matter. A rerun of  d&rsquo;Hondt up to the eleventh post has been ruled out, even on the terms on which  Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP had already decided that they were renouncing taking up  the justice portfolio&mdash; a renunciation that they would simply practise during  the rerun. That leaves the remaining option, which is that if there is to be  democratic inclusion under d&rsquo;Hondt, that that be done simply by means of a  d&rsquo;Hondt top-up. That would mean that parties&rsquo; portfolios for none of the other  10 Departments would change, and the eleventh Ministry would to the eleventh  choice under d&rsquo;Hondt. If the Alliance Party had the eleventh choice under  d&rsquo;Hondt, I would be supporting that option. I have said that before not only in  the Chamber but in other meetings, talks, negotiations and chambers.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Contrary to Naomi Long&rsquo;s earlier unworthy allegations, the  proof that we are sincere was demonstrated when previous Secretaries of State  suggested legislation for various models for devolving justice and policing.  One version stated that Ministers could be appointed by a cross-community vote,  and there was provision that a Minister could not be from a designation other  than unionist or nationalist. Although my party and I did not agree with  departing from the Good Friday Agreement by way of departing from d&rsquo;Hondt, we  were not going to agree that, when people were legislating to depart from  d&rsquo;Hondt, there should be further discrimination built in against the Alliance  Party. On the Floor of the House of Commons, I protested to the Secretary of  State that that was double discrimination; it was preventing the due run of  d&rsquo;Hondt and inclusion, and it specifically excluded one party. Even if that  party were democratically entitled to the position, it would have been  excluded. If the Alliance Party had a bigger representation here in the future  and, therefore, was entitled to a ministerial position under d&rsquo;Hondt, it would  have been excluded on the cross-community basis. That would have been direct  discrimination against one party, and the SDLP protested against that because  it was wrong. We do not do discrimination or exclusion, unlike the parties that  are opposing our amendments.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We heard earlier from the Alliance Party, and, in an  intervention, my colleague Declan O&rsquo;Loan spoke of how that party had strongly  trailed itself here as the party of principled opposition. It is no secret that  other parties are talking directly and intently about the Alliance Party&rsquo;s  providing the justice Minister. Neither is it a secret that the Alliance Party  leader, in particular, is being named. He is being named not only by Members  but by the Government and the Secretary of State. Let us stop the pretence  about the issue. Let us not pretend that there is not an expectation about done  deals or anything else. Let us bring a bit of honesty and reality to the issue.  The Alliance Party, which was the voice of principled opposition, will come  into government on that basis; the opposition will be no more, and the  principle never was. That is the position that we will have.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">For instance, the leader of the Alliance Party has already  received confidential security briefings, and I know that he has been asked to  back off and calm down on issues such as a shared future. Last week, some of us  inadvertently discovered that those sorts of untoward approaches were being  made to the Alliance Party leader by the British Government. The party was  asked to quieten down about a shared future in the countdown to the devolution  of justice and policing, and, because that was rumbled, the Alliance Party  suddenly went into hot and heavy mode late last week about the devolution of  justice and policing and a shared future, and it appeared to introduce its own  precondition.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: Get  your timetable right.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  Mr Ford might tell me to get my timetable right, but we know the timetable of  the e-mail to the Liberal Democrats in which he might not have said that it was  time to be nice to Shaun Woodward, but he did say that Mr Woodward was trying  to do the right thing in the current situation and that, perhaps, people should  go easy on him. We do not work like that. I used to think that the Alliance  Party did not work like that either, but we have discovered differently.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is for that variety of reasons that we are in this  situation. It has corrupted not only d&rsquo;Hondt and the Good Friday Agreement but  there is evidence that it is corrupting the Alliance Party. We are seeing that  today, for instance, by virtue of the different language that is being used. We  are seeing traces of the voluntary coalition that the Alliance Party wants. It  wants a voluntary coalition with Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP, so it is happy to get  into the practice of voluntary coalition. Sinn F&eacute;in betrayed democratic  inclusion when it supported the exclusion of parties that did not vote for the  First Minister and deputy First Minister, and, at that time, it was basically  opting for voluntary coalition because the principle that a party should be in  govern&shy;ment only if it votes for the heads of government is part of the theory  and understanding of voluntary coalition. Sinn F&eacute;in was justifying that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In fairness, the Alliance Party has been consistent in  that, and Sinn F&eacute;in has been totally inconsistent.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: Are  we being corrupted or consistent?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  The Alliance Party is being consistent on the issue of a voluntary coalition  and corrupted on various other issues, including the shared future and the  whole notion of principled opposition. I recall the leader of the Alliance  Party telling us that they were in opposition as a matter of principle. In one  interview he said that even if they were entitled to a post, they would not  take it because they thought that this place needed opposition. He even said  that in relation to the justice Ministry. The Alliance Party held the position  that it would not even take the justice Ministry because this place needed the  Alliance Party in opposition. Of course, that has changed. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">This is very much about the Bill; this is about the  problems of clause 2 and the entirely false arguments that were raised against  the SDLP&rsquo;s amendments and its opposition to clause 2.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP has been able to demonstrate that its amendments  do nothing to wreck the Bill or to prevent the devolution of justice and  policing. It has not tabled its amendments as preconditions that would stand in  the way of the devolution of justice and policing. None of our amendments, if  they were legislated for, would be a barrier or an impediment to the devolution  of justice and policing. They would not stop anything from proceeding on a given  date. They would ensure that things proceeded according to the agreement if no  vote had been taken to do things outside the agreement, which is what other  parties want. Nothing would stop.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is the idea that the SDLP&rsquo;s amendments would create a  crisis in 14 days. They would not. They would create certainty in 14 days:  certainty that would be well fuelled by the confidence that the public could  take from the fact that in agreeing this we were agreeing that once we started  a process, that process would continue to full devolution in a reasonable time.  There would also be the confidence that would come from the statement that  could be made by the First Minister and the deputy First Minister, not just  dealing with the issues of 2012 and allaying the different concerns and  interpretations that might exist around the sunset clause and whether the  fallback arrangements may or may not come into play.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, the statement that we are asking the First  Minister and the deputy First Minister to make in our second amendment would  include a statement on the functions of the Department of justice. In  conversations with the First Minister and the deputy First Minister and others,  the SDLP has suggested that questions regarding the functions of the Department  of justice are valid and should be examined. The Department should not be  defined just by taking the functions, the personnel and the premises from the  NIO. If we are talking about a serious project of devolution, let us think  about the character and the remit of the Department.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Some functions that are currently devolved could sensibly  move to a Department of justice. This is not about party turf and party  territory; in my view, the functions that deal with licensing laws, etc, which  currently rest in DSD should, very sensibly, go to a Department of justice. Of  course, that would have to be proposed by the First Minister and the deputy  First Minister and go a vote in the House. However, there are similar functions  in other Departments. Various legal functions are tied up in DFP for no other  reason than it was felt at the time that there was nowhere else for them to  sensibly go. However, they could fit in with a Department of justice. The  licensing function rests with the Department of Justice in the South and with  the Home Office across the water, and sensibly so. Those are sensible,  straightforward things that could be addressed in the report that the First  Minister and the deputy First Minister would make, and they could, possibly, be  adopted and reflected in the resolution that the House would adopt under the  SDLP&rsquo;s amendments.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP&rsquo;s amendments are not meant to wreck anything; they  are meant to achieve devolution, and to get it done in good, sound and well  thought out terms. This group of amendments is not proposed to wreck anything;  it is proposed to prevent the wrecking tactics that could come in 2012 and to  prevent the uncertainty around the re-election of a justice Minister &mdash; or the  failure to re-elect a justice Minister &mdash; that could happen in 2011. We could do  without all of that uncertainty.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That uncertainty about 2011, on top of all the budget  difficulties that we will have and the strains that we will be under at that  time, could be too big a temptation for some parties.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">6.30 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We do not feel, on the basis of the experience that we have  had, that we can be blas&eacute; about those things and simply believe that the  worst-case scenario will never come about. As good legislators, we are trying  to ensure good prospects and good outcomes, rather than legislate for bad ones  and just hope for the best.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: I  declare an interest as a member of the Policing Board. This stage of the Bill  is another important step towards the devolution of policing and justice,  although one would not think that, given the Armageddon attitude of the SDLP.  Much of what has been put forward by the SDLP runs contrary to what has been  agreed by the Assembly and Executive Review Committee and the Assembly, and  that, of course, is deliberate.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Although the proposer of the SDLP amendments argued that  there has been no agreement on certain issues, considerable work has been done,  and that work is ongoing. Agreement has been reached on a number of issues  pertaining to policing and justice, and further agreements will be made in  preparation for devolution. All those amendments have not been proposed in the  interest of resolving those matters. Indeed, the SDLP Members seem to be very  good at telling us what they want but not how they would go about getting what  they want while taking account of the stark political reality, as everyone else  has to do.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is similar to the debate about academic selection, when,  for more than two years, they criticised the Minister for her proposals but  gave absolutely no alternative. What alternative did they give at the end of  that debate? The retention of the 11-plus &mdash; the status quo. That is no  surprise.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Similarly, today, they have no alternative based on the  political reality of what we in Sinn F&eacute;in are doing in regard to policing and  justice. They would probably not mind if the status quo were to remain in this  case too, so that they could engage in further politically opportune attacks on  us. That is all the SDLP is about these days: attacking Sinn F&eacute;in at every  opportunity, regardless of how serious the consequences might be. We, however,  will continue to build on the political progress made and will not feed into  those negative political agendas.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The devolution of policing and justice should happen sooner  rather than later, as the Minister of Finance and Personnel has already said,  especially given the substantial amount of money that has been secured from the  British Government. It would be extremely foolish of us to look that gift horse  in the mouth. The sunset clause and the 2012 date create an imperative on  everybody to secure agreement, and people will want to see a locally  accountable Minister in position post 2012; not a fly-in, fly-out British  Minister from across the water.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have been listening to much of what Mr Durkan said. He  mentioned side issues, and Members in his party have referred, in recent weeks,  to the full-time Reserve and parades, and they have given out misinformation,  particularly in regard to the comments that they made about members of the  strategic review into parading, which were simply untrue. The SDLP needs to  check its facts. Perhaps that party was feeding the public misinformation for  political opportunism.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We should not spend too much time discussing the proposed  amendments, because they are mischievous and a waste of time. The reasons for  tabling the amendments are politically opportune; they demonstrate the SDLP&rsquo;s  negative attitude and the fact that that party is about nothing but scoring  points against Sinn F&eacute;in. One could be forgiven for thinking that the SDLP is  working hard to ensure that the devolution of policing and justice does not  come to pass. To date, its contribution to the Bill has been extremely  unhelpful and stands in the way of the devolution of policing and justice,  rather than helping it. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. It has been a lengthy debate on  policing and justice, and perhaps rightly so, but I suspect that the SDLP  contributions have relied on quantity rather than quality. SDLP Member&rsquo;s  contributions can be condensed down; they have probably lasted around two and a  half hours so far.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Despite that party&rsquo;s valiant attempts at the end of each  contribution to claim that its opposition to the Bill as it stands is a based  on concerns to do with d&rsquo;Hondt and concerns about the Good Friday Agreement,  the vast majority of its Members&rsquo; contributions so far have been on the needs  of the SDLP: they have been about the Social Democratic and Labour Party; the  party, rather than the people whom it is supposed to serve.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We would not even be at this stage of discussion on  policing and justice if the SDLP&rsquo;s view had been upheld in the previous debate.  If the SDLP had had its way in September 2009, policing and justice would have  stopped. Transfer of those powers would have been over. We would have gone back  to year zero because the SDLP wanted to vote down the Bill.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Despite the SDLP&rsquo;s valiant attempts, we have now reached  Consideration Stage of the Bill. We are currently discussing the amendments  that the SDLP tabled, as it was perfectly entitled to do. However, it cannot  table those amendments on the basis that the Bill is not competent, because the  Deputy Speaker has already made a ruling on that. The Assembly can only discuss  legislation that is competent. I assume that the same rules are adhered to in  Westminster, and I am confident, despite the comments of Mr Durkan, that the  Assembly and Executive Review Committee is more than capable of producing a  report that fits in with the competency of the Assembly.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP&rsquo;s argument, through its amendments, is that the  Assembly and the public are incapable of reaching agreement within 30 months.  According to that argument, Armageddon will fall upon us all at the end of  those 30 months, and the creatures of the night will come out to rule society.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">However, let us consider the position of 30 months ago.  This institution had not elected its Executive, we were at the tender  beginnings of that process and we were not involved in the legislative process.  A few months before even that, few commentators or politicians were convinced  that we would be able to reach agreement, but Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP worked to  reach a deal. In fact, the SDLP laboured on that issue at great length. At the  height of the negotiations among Sinn F&eacute;in, the DUP, the British Government,  the American Government and the Dublin Government, it proposed that we should  abandon those talks and introduce a commission of businesspeople because the  politicians would not be able to work it out.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>: I  have a direct correction to make. The SDLP never made that proposal during  negotiations.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Is that right?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  The SDLP made that proposal during a prolonged period of suspension that had no  end in sight and when no talks were in prospect. It was not made during any talks  or any negotiations. Again, Sinn F&eacute;in has completely misrepresented the facts.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  am sure that the Deputy Speaker will allow me some latitude as I deviate from  the Bill to explain where the SDLP stood on that matter. Does the SDLP honestly  believe that negotiations never stop? In any forum of politics, does the SDLP  really believe that the public void is really the void? Of course negotiations  were going on. They may not have been intense or pointed, but they were going  on. In the middle of that, the SDLP said that politicians would never agree;  the Shinners and the DUP would never agree. It suggested that an unelected and  unaccountable comm&shy;ission of 10 businesspeople be introduced, not by d&rsquo;Hondt or  by cross-community support, to run this place.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP amendments to the Bill try to convince us that,  despite its serious concerns, its observation is that we will not reach  agreement until after 30 months. I do not know whether we will or not. I know  that the politicians and the community outside are capable of reaching an  agreement. Despite all the odds, they have proven that. However, the SDLP &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  The note that John has been passed can be read some other time.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  It says:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Can you advise John to sit down?&rdquo;<span style="font-style:normal; "> </span><span style="font-size:10.5pt; font-style:normal; ">[Laughter.]</span></p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP tells us that, although we will not reach that  agreement in 30 months, under its proposals, we will reach it within 14 days.  Later, in the second part of the debate, we will discuss amendment No 6, which  asks for 7 December 2009 to be inserted into the Bill as devolution day.  Therefore, the SDLP tells us that, by 21 December, we will have reached  political agreement on the way forward, everything will be rosy in the garden,  and the SDLP will have corrected all of Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s &mdash; in its opinion &mdash;  negotiating mistakes. The DUP will have explained where Sinn F&eacute;in is going  wrong, and the SDLP will have sorted everything out. The SDLP suggests that, by  21 December 2009, there will be a permanent, immovable, unshakeable justice  Department.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  The Member says that that will occur by 21 December 2009. Having listened to  previous contributions from Members on the SDLP Benches, will he accept that  that will actually occur within two weeks of Royal Assent being granted to the  Department of Justice Bill; not within two weeks of devolution day?  Potentially, therefore, it would be earlier than 21 December.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  am glad that Mr Hamilton pointed that out, because that makes it even more  stark; there is even less time to reach agreement. We will not reach agreement  within 30 months; however, we will do it within a couple of weeks. That is the  logic of the SDLP&rsquo;s argument. Despite the two-and-a-half-hour-long  contributions that have been made by the amendments&rsquo; sponsors, I have not heard  anything that contradicts that logic.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Why has the SDLP tabled those amendments? Are they an  attempt to make the SDLP relevant to the discussion on the transfer of policing  and justice? That is, quite possibly, the case.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  The Member has castigated my party for its target date of 7 December 2009. He  says that it is unrealistic. Does that, therefore, mean that Sinn F&eacute;in no  longer takes the position that the transfer can be achieved before Christmas?  That is its public and private position. It has said that it must be done  before Christmas. Gerry Adams said that clearly and categorically. Have I got  that wrong, or does Sinn F&eacute;in now resile from that position?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  am more than happy to correct Mr Durkan on that point. Sinn F&eacute;in has said that  the deal is required to be done before Christmas. There is no reason why a deal  on the transfer of policing and justice cannot be completed before Christmas.  In legislative and practical terms, that does not mean the establishment of a  policing and justice Department before December. However, an agreement on the  date, process and operations of that Department is more than achievable before  Christmas.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The motivation behind amendments is as important as the  amendments themselves. I hope and wish that the SDLP would join with other  parties who attempt to ensure that policing and justice are transferred to this  institution, that they fall into local hands, and that the new Department  carries out the remit for which it is required. As I said earlier, the issue is  not about the needs of the SDLP, Sinn F&eacute;in, the Alliance Party, the DUP or the  Ulster Unionist Party; it is about the needs of the communities whom we serve.  They are crying out not only for a locally accountable policing service, but  for a locally accountable justice system that meets their needs. At present, it  does not.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Martina Anderson mentioned occasions when she, as an  elected representative in the city of Derry,  requires access to a local Minister. All Members could think of examples of  times when they need access to a local justice Minister or, indeed, to a  justice Committee in the Assembly to ensure that criminal legislation that is  passed meets their communities&rsquo; needs. That does not happen at present.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If other Members have workable, practical solutions to the  problems that the Assembly faces, I can assure them that Sinn F&eacute;in is all ears.  However, the amendments that are before the House do not offer those solutions.  They will not ensure the transfer of policing and justice powers; they are only  a furtherance of SDLP contributions to previous debates, which would mean an  end to discussion of the transfer of policing and justice.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">6.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I move on now to who should hold the post of Minister and  why my party supports the arrangements in the Bill. We must build confidence in  the new Ministry because the lack of accountable policing and justice systems  was at the heart of the conflict that we endured for more than 30 years.  Members from the unionist Benches spoke about their experiences of the  conflict; our experiences were clearly different. The justice and policing  systems were used against, rather than on behalf of, the community.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">An Ulster Unionist Party contributor to the debate talked  about the Minister of Home Affairs. I assure him that I can think of no  previous Minister of Home Affairs who, in the opinion of the nationalist community,  served it fairly, equally or justly. Those Ministers were used to introduce  repressive legislation against communities from the 1920s to the 1970s, when  they were replaced by British Secretaries of State, who followed on.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The nationalist and republican communities who endured the  worst of those excesses must have confidence in a Minister of justice.  Cross-community support is the best way in which we can deliver that essential  element of confidence at this time. I am always bemused by the SDLP&rsquo;s constant  references to how it corrected Sinn F&eacute;in and saying that had it not been for  the SDLP, the entire process would be blah, blah, blah.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am more than happy to listen to contributions and take  interventions from any political party. It would be foolish of any party,  including mine, not to listen to fellow politicians during public or private  negotiations. I can give an assurance, however, that Sinn F&eacute;in did not need the  SDLP to point out anything during the wider debate on the transfer of policing  and justice. In the words of Alex Attwood, we went into the negotiations with  our &ldquo;eyes wide open&rdquo;, and they remain wide open. We are conscious of the  difficulties that we have overcome and those that we face. We continue to  believe, as we have throughout a difficult process, that we can overcome any  problems through co-operation with everyone around the table. If, at times, we  have to go on alone, we will. Sometimes, that is the way it has to be in  politics; it is a difficult post.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in has ruled out only one party from taking the post  of justice Minister; that party is Sinn F&eacute;in. The Democratic Unionist Party  ruled itself out. Why? Both parties believe that they need to instil confidence  in the post. If the SDLP can agree and nominate a candidate, Sinn F&eacute;in is on  record as saying that it will support that nomination. Today, Mark Durkan  revealed that there has been ongoing dialogue for a considerable time between  the SDLP and the DUP. I must take note not to have a private meeting with Mark  in case details of it end up in the middle of a debate, but that is another  matter.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If, during discussions with the DUP, Mark Durkan or the  future leader of the SDLP can convince the DUP that the SDLP has the best  person for the job, so be it. That would be good, but Sinn F&eacute;in cannot convince  the DUP of that. Sinn F&eacute;in cannot provide the DUP with a reference for the  SDLP; it is up to the SDLP to do that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP&rsquo;s current strategy as wreckers of the Executive  and wreckers of the transfer of policing and justice does not allow any  political party to take it seriously. Today, its role in political life is to  wreck. If I were sitting on the Benches opposite, I would be placing a major  question mark over approaching a party that seems intent on disrupting the  whole political process or advancing its political cause above what everyone  else is doing.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The transfer of policing and justice presents challenges  ahead for us all. The situation is not ideal, but the Bill is what is required  at this moment in our collective history in order to move forward.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is decision time on policing and justice. We have been  through a long, complex negotiation, and we have succeeded in many ways.  Collectively, the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in have succeeded in securing an extra &pound;1  billion for the justice package from the British Government and the British  Treasury. That alone is a remarkable contribution to society. However, if policing  and justice powers are not transferred, that contribution will not be made, and  there will be a continuing deficit in the policing and justice budget. In fact,  in the run up to the next CSR period and the next Budget, the British  Government may make major cuts to all our public services.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">All the political parties have a lot of soul-searching and  decision-making to do. The DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in have major decisions to make; the  SDLP and the Ulster Unionist Party, in particular, have decisions to make too,  because as long as the Ulster Unionist Party plays cheerleader for the TUV, the  Members on the Benches beside it will continue to look over their shoulders and  wonder what is going on.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. Will he enlighten me on comments that his  party leader made this month? Mr Adams said that the DUP is in breach of the  commitments that it entered into at St Andrews.  Will the Member expand on what those commitments are and how the party is in  breach of them?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  suspect that the Member knows the answer to that question, because any  politician who asks a question that he does not know the answer to &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Members must focus on the issue that is being debated.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  We certainly agree. I assume that my party leader was referring to May 2008,  which has now passed, when he made those comments.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I support the Bill and oppose the amendments for the  reasons that I have given. As the days tick by, there is no point in debating  the legislative process in the Chamber; we must now enact legislation to  appoint a justice Minister and a justice Committee and start dealing with the  matters that affect all in our community. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>:  Through its amendments to the justice Bill, the SDLP is seeking to ensure that  the public is best protected and served. It is important to remember that the  Bill is about providing good community policing and robust local justice  powers. Sinn F&eacute;in, in particular, has stated that there should be no further  hurdles to the devolution of justice and policing. The deputy First Minister  and other Sinn F&eacute;in members are on record calling for devolution before  Christmas. I, therefore, ask that they consider supporting our amendments today  and committing to devolution by December 2009.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to focus on some of the issues mentioned. I was  interested to hear Anna Lo highlight one such issue that is of concern to the  community. She said recently:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;It would be nearly  impossible for progress to be made on issues such as policing and justice if we  don&rsquo;t have a shared future strategy agreed urgently.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We remember the whirlwind of bad publicity worldwide over  the intimidation that forced Romanian families out of their Belfast homes. We are in the teeth of a  financial crisis; yet cash is being wasted on maintaining the division.  Therefore, the best way to safeguard vital front line health and other services  is to sort out our shared future.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It was my understanding that the Alliance Party signed up to  the Good Friday Agreement and its protections, but, apparently, they are not  now entirely supportive of it. The Alliance Party has no qualms about accepting  the post of justice Minister that is provided for under legislation that bars  half the community from applying for that post.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  Let me make it crystal clear for anyone who has not been listening: the  Alliance Party has not said that it would have no qualms in accepting the  justice Ministry. The Alliance Party has not been offered the post; therefore,  it has not responded to any such offer. As I have said in the past, although  Members seem unwilling to listen, the Alliance Party has not said that it would  have no qualms in accepting a justice Ministry. However, we have been crystal  clear about wanting to see reform of the institutions with regard to how the  Executive is formed.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>: I  apologise; I obviously took the Member up wrong.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Nevertheless, it begs the question: what is the DUP&rsquo;s job  description for the justice Minister&rsquo;s post, which openly excludes an SDLP  Member? It says, in other words, that no nationalist need apply. According to  Ms Anderson, a unionist justice Minister, from either the Ulster Unionist Party  or the DUP, would not be acceptable to the Sinn F&eacute;in electorate. Therefore, it  is a mutual veto.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  I did not say that that would not be acceptable to the Sinn F&eacute;in electorate.  Under its outgoing leader, the SDLP has had six electoral defeats. I said that  the republican and nationalist community will not accept a DUP or UUP Minister.  If the Member had her finger on the pulse of the community she would know that.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>:  That is exactly what I said. However, I do not believe that the SDLP electorate  would be opposed to either a unionist or nationalist justice Minister who was  appointed fairly.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">How much has really changed? Is this about community  confidence or is it about discrimination and sectarianism? Whichever it is, it  is extremely depressing.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As a solution, we have heard the DUP, Sinn F&eacute;in and  Alliance Party cross-community design to ensure that a nationalist Minister may  not be appointed. That principle &mdash; that a nationalist need not apply &mdash; is what  the SDLP is concerned about. What if the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in change their minds  and throw out an Alliance Party justice Minister? What mechanism will we use  then?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  The Member referred to the relationship between different parties. However, her  own party lauded the fact that the SDLP, the Ulster Unionist Party and the  Alliance Party are great wee parties that could work together and govern the  place fine, as long as the rest of the parties were kept out. If I remember  correctly, the SDLP fought a number of election campaigns on that basis.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>: I  do not agree with that statement; the SDLP has always supported inclusive  politics.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">For most of the population of the North, community  confidence is about how we deal with victims of crime, the imprisonment of  offenders, the provision of youth justice services and ensuring that we have  the best resources, such as state-of-the-art forensic science technology, so  that we can catch criminals. All those issues are dealt with in the amendments  that have been proposed by the SDLP. None of those issues appears to have been  considered by the other parties.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In September, the SDLP held a conference on youth justice,  during which we outlined our plans and proposals for the reform of the current  youth justice system. At that conference, party members heard testimony from  Sarah Holland, the daughter of murdered west Belfast greengrocer, Harry Holland. Mr  Holland&rsquo;s killers were given lenient sentences after it emerged that that the  Public Prosecution Service had struck a bargain that resulted in some of the  charges being dropped. Ms Holland told the assembled audience that her family  had learned the hard way the failings of the criminal justice system. Her  family described the PPS and judiciary as inefficient and not fit for purpose  to address crime in the twenty-first century.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">7.00 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">So, there are many questions. How do people experience  policing in their neighbourhoods? What powers will come our way? Will the  system that we inherit need a radical overhaul? It is clear &mdash; and not only from  the experience of the Holland  family &mdash; that the fear of crime in communities is high while the level of  public confidence in the justice system is low. Our justice system must exist  to serve the public by offering protection, by instilling competence in its  agencies, by serving the needs of victims and by preventing reoffending. Only  when we recognise those issues &mdash; as the SDLP has done in its amendments &mdash; can  we even begin to think about tackling the real problems.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is in our interest as a society to ensure that crime and  antisocial behaviour are tackled effectively. Society as a whole will benefit  from such a system. We must begin at the most basic level by calculating benefit  through increased public savings.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I recollect speaking about two years ago in this Chamber  about the disparity in child protection regulations and the registration of  sexual offenders across the island   of Ireland. In today&rsquo;s  amendments, the SDLP recognises the need for further consideration of the  management of offenders. Rather than the squabbling between the DUP and Sinn  F&eacute;in, we should be debating the best way to cope with the issues on an all-island  basis. It is imperative that our child protection system should be safe and  have the confidence of the people of Ireland on both sides of the  border. It is imperative that there be full co-operation in both jurisdictions  to adopt the best possible practice &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. I ask the Member to return to the issue that we are  discussing.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>: I  understood that we were talking about competence in the justice system and how  we can achieve that. I apologise if I misunderstood.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: We are talking about the amendments to the Bill.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>: I  beg your pardon, but I am talking about community confidence. My remarks have  been far more direct than some of what I have been listening to since noon. <em>[Interruption.]</em></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. I ask Members to respect the Chair and to make their  remarks through it. I am doing my best to chair the debate, and I need the  support and help of those Members who are shouting across the Chamber.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>:  We need to concentrate on community confidence.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is interesting that, in August last year, David Ford  recognised that the Executive were failing in their duties and not dealing with  the substantive issues. He said:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Alliance  Party will not be taking the Policing and Justice Ministry. This Executive is  failing in its duties, so Northern    Ireland needs a strong and coherent  opposition. We are providing that opposition and we will continue to do so.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">What has the DUP promised the Alliance Party in order to  change its mind? Has it promised to publish the long-overdue and fought-over  cohesion, sharing and integration strategy? It would be great if that strategy  was published, but surely it would happen anyway. Securing that should not require  the rights of half the population to be neglected.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">All the parties in the Chamber should consider supporting  the SDLP amendment to oppose clause 2 standing part of the Bill, in order to  protect the democratic voice of all communities in Northern Ireland. All parties must  then agree a date for devolution so that we can get on with dealing with the  substantive issues, such as youth justice, helping victims of crime, the  imprisonment of offenders, enhancing North/South work on policing, child  protection and the provision of the best up-to-date ways to catch offenders. I  support the SDLP amendments.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: We  are a considerable way through what has been a very long and unproductive  debate. There have been close to six hours of discussion, and I hesitate to say  that we are any further on.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Frankly, we have heard approximately three hours of  contributions from the SDLP, which has not made one iota of progress towards  convincing anyone of the merits of its proposals. If anything, the party has  illustrated its own confusion and highlighted the quite destructive role that  it is playing in the potential devolution of policing and justice.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have strong ambitions for this society and strong liberal  principles. I have a clear notion of how society should be organised and  governed. However, as a politician, I am a pragmatist, and I must recognise  that policing and justice powers have not been devolved. I dearly want that to  happen. I think that we are ready for it, and I think that society needs it.  The Bill is part of the mechanism by which we will achieve that. Therefore,  although we might need interim arrangements and a fix of some description to  get there, we must be clear that our actions are making progress in society.  Over the past 10 to 15 years, progress has sometimes been extremely tortuous.  However, it is important to keep making progress.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Although it is in everyone&rsquo;s interest to gain as much  clarity as possible, we must be realistic about what is achievable at the  moment. We have reached a measure of agreement on how devolution can occur, but  we must find further agreements in the immediate future through which to make  further progress. We should be thankful that we can make those steps in the  right direction. We should not create a situation in which the perfect becomes  the enemy of the good.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague Naomi Long gave a substantial tour de force on  the issue, and I do not intend to repeat everything that she said. Indeed, I  will endeavour to be in the lower half of Members&rsquo; speaking times during the  debate. I will seek, as far as possible, to discuss the amendments. I will  respond to the comments of the Member from the SDLP who spoke previously. My  colleagues and I are more than happy to engage in full and detailed discussion  on criminal justice policy in Northern    Ireland. There is much to be said and much  to be done. Frankly, that is not the topic of discussion today; we are having a  supposedly focused debate on the amendments.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The central issue of the debate and the amendments is,  perhaps, the notion of a cross-community vote versus the use of d&rsquo;Hondt. Mrs  Hanna referred to the Alliance Party&rsquo;s support for the Good Friday Agreement.  The Alliance Party did support the Good Friday Agreement; we were extremely  proud to do so and extremely proud of the role that we played for 30 years to  help Northern Ireland to reach that point. However, although we were not  comfortable with some aspects of governance in the Good Friday Agreement, we  made a decision to support it in the round. We gave our support despite those  aspects, not because of them. It is perfectly legitimate for us to make  arguments for improvement.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">On 10 April 1998, it was not the case that a group of  individuals who were infused with some special wisdom laid out a set of  institutions and mechanisms that were right for that time and for every day in  the future. Our society is constantly changing, and our institutions need to  evolve. The Alliance Party has been clear about its agenda for reform of the  institutions. Indeed, we published a substantive document about seven years ago  named &lsquo;Agenda for Democracy&rsquo;, which set out our proposals, particularly those  for moving towards a voluntary coalition approach to Executive formation and  for changes to the voting system and designations. There are different ways to  provide cross-community power-sharing governance. We are open to such a debate.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The principles that lie behind the Good Friday Agreement  are important. The d&rsquo;Hondt process is not a principle; it is purely a mechanism  of proportionality, although not a very good one.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Although the Alliance Party has an agenda for reform, we  embrace the mechanisms that are set out in the Bill as positive influences on  that agenda. Not for one minute, however, do we think that it represents a  sudden lurch towards the voluntary coalition in which we believe. I want to  make it clear that, from our perspective, any party could be a part of a  voluntary coalition.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We have several criticisms of d&rsquo;Hondt. First, it creates a  system under which Ministers can make solo runs. I will correct Alan McFarland,  who said earlier that d&rsquo;Hondt was the best way of providing inclusive  government. Even from the Ulster Unionist Party&rsquo;s perspective, there are  concerns about the way in which Ministers have been able to make solo runs in  the Chamber. I will give two examples: on the one hand, the Sinn F&eacute;in Minister  of Education can pursue proposals that do not have the support of the Assembly,  but because her party got the education portfolio, the Sinn F&eacute;in perspective  dominates in that area, and everyone else has to suffer that. The DUP did  something similar. There was a groundswell of support for the establishment of  an independent environmental protection agency. However, because the DUP  controlled the Department of the Environment, it was able to impose its will  and frustrate that development.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The d&rsquo;Hondt system does not lend itself to power sharing.  It lends itself to carve-ups of power, in which different parties get control  of different sections of the agenda. Consequently, we do not have collective  outcomes that are fashioned across the political divide. That is the essence of  power sharing: ensuring that the interests of every section of society are  taken into account in decisions, and d&rsquo;Hondt does not lend itself to that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The potential move in the legislation towards giving any  Minister of justice a sense of cross-community legitimacy is a positive  suggestion. I will clarify how that fits into our longer-term agenda. The  Alliance Party made a proposal at the St Andrews  talks that even after d&rsquo;Hondt had been used to select Ministers, there should  be an overall &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. The Member must return to the amendment.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  OK. I am grateful for the Deputy Speaker&rsquo;s guidance. I am trying to make a  point about how a cross-community vote, which is set out in clause 2, and which  the amendment would remove, can play a positive role in providing  cross-community legitimacy and making it parallel. The Alliance Party wanted  that vote to ratify the entire Executive, and there is a precedent for that in  the case of the European Commission.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  I am loathe to challenge the Member&rsquo;s technical ability to talk about d&rsquo;Hondt,  but will he accept that it is just a mechanism for selecting Ministers and that  it does not govern the powers of Ministers when they are appointed? The Member  mentioned the establishment of an independent environmental protection agency,  but that has to do with the powers of a Minister and is not related to the  method by which Ministers are selected.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: It  is also a reflection of the limited breadth of the Programme for Government,  which allows Ministers to make solo runs in areas that are not covered by it. I  take the Minister&rsquo;s point and I will place it in that context.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to make some points about whether d&rsquo;Hondt is an  inclusive system. First, d&rsquo;Hondt is a very blunt form of proportionality. It  carries the risk of distortion in that it is biased in favour of larger parties  and groupings. It is also biased in favour of sections of society that are more  cohesive and united. For example, if there were a situation where there were  two unionist parties and three nationalist parties, or vice versa, the section  of society with the fewest parties would do better under d&rsquo;Hondt. A section of  society should not suffer as a consequence just because it is more fractured  than another. However, that is one of the consequences of the system.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">7.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, the d&rsquo;Hondt mechanism runs the risk of creating  substantial anomalies. To explain the risks that are inherent in a system that  is supposedly so fair and inclusive, I will give three examples of where  d&rsquo;Hondt has gone off the rails badly. During the 1996 Forum elections, the  d&rsquo;Hondt system was used to allocate seats. In Lagan Valley,  which I will discuss in a minute, five unionists were elected. No one from any  other section of the community was elected, yet I know for a fact that at least  20% of people in that area are not unionist. Is it right and fair that d&rsquo;Hondt  was used to exclude those people?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Equally, in the Foyle constituency, where I accept that  there is a significant unionist minority, the use of the d&rsquo;Hondt system  returned five nationalists and no unionist representatives whatever.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps the most farcical example of the use of d&rsquo;Hondt  lies in this Assembly and concerns the formation of the Executive. If one looks  back to the Executive &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  The Forum.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Yes, the Forum. The first Assembly Executive between 1998 and 2003 had a 50:50  ratio of unionists and nationalists. Perhaps 99% of the population of Northern Ireland  and most international commentators thought that that balance was written into  the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  I am sorry. I would like some clarity. I was confused when the Member spoke  about what happened in Foyle. He mentioned that the election was run by  d&rsquo;Hondt. Can the Member explain that, please?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Without going into too much detail of electoral systems, a list system was used  whereby the seats were allocated on the basis of the d&rsquo;Hondt formula. I am  happy to explain it to the Member after the debate so that I do not detain  everyone, but it is a matter of public record that that system was used for the  1996 Forum elections.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The 50:50 split of the Executive between 1998 and 2003 was effectively  an accident of how d&rsquo;Hondt worked out. Given that, at that stage, unionism was  fractured among a multitude of parties and nationalist parties had two seats,  the system effectively brought a balance of 50:50 between the two blocs. Since  then, there have been fresh elections, and we have a new Executive. The balance  between unionist and nationalist politicians is now 60:40 in favour of  unionists.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Since the first Executive were formed and into the  formation of the second, there has been an increase in the number of  nationalist politicians in the Assembly. We are in the bizarre situation of  having an increased number of nationalist seats in the Chamber and a decrease  in the proportion of nationalist seats in the Executive. So much for the  all-inclusive, very effective system of d&rsquo;Hondt.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP has now recognised the limitations of the d&rsquo;Hondt  system, even though it notionally seeks to defend d&rsquo;Hondt at every quarter in  the Chamber. In Lisburn City Council, it has quite rightly realised that  d&rsquo;Hondt works against the interests of inclusion of all sections of the  community, particularly nationalist representatives. We support what the SDLP  has sought to do in Lisburn by challenging that, but the position that its  councillors have taken is completely at odds with the position of the party in  the Chamber. That issue has not been addressed so far.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP has made great virtue of its opposition to all  forms of discrimination and its favouring of inclusion. I remind the SDLP that  it defends tooth and nail the system of designation and the associated voting  system. That system discriminates against my party and any other party whose  representatives in the Chamber do not align themselves with unionism or  nationalism. Votes from my section of the community count for less in  cross-community votes. That is not a good advertisement for inclusive  governance, and that system needs to be changed significantly.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As many Members mentioned, the implications of selecting a  Minister by a cross-community vote include the security of tenure of a Minister  of justice, whether he or she is from the Alliance Party or another party, and  the potential for that Minister to be a puppet. Naomi Long made the point that  any Minister in the Executive could potentially be a puppet and that Ministers  from the Ulster Unionist Party and the SDLP are particularly vulnerable to that  risk. The risk of puppetry exists across the board, but we are extremely  conscious of that aspect of the legislation. Our support for that system is  balanced; it is a new departure for the Assembly as regards cross-community  legitimacy and it is the right way to go.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to clarify how the risks relating to security of  tenure can be managed. The most effective way of reducing those risks is to  have as much agreement and discussion as possible on what a Minister of justice  and the Executive will seek to do regarding policing and justice policy in  advance of devolution. I will resist the temptation to speak in detail, as  Carmel Hanna attempted to do, on what should and should not be done. However, I  will say that devolution must be a process rather than simply an event that  takes place on a particular day, after which we sit back and relax.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The more agreement there is on policy issues, the more  protection a Minister of justice will have. The greater controversies in the  Assembly have occurred in areas in which Ministers have sought to take actions  as individual Ministers outside the context of an agreed Programme for  Government. At the time of its inception, my party was critical of the  Programme for Government&rsquo;s shortness, its lack of detail and breadth and its  omission of some controversial issues. Progress has been relatively smooth in  areas in which there has been agreement. However, the areas in which there has  not been agreement have brought chaos to the Chamber.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is in the interests of anyone taking the post, and of  society as a whole, to have as much consensus as possible in advance of  devolution. That may even involve an addendum to the Programme for Government.  Security of tenure would thereby be addressed, because the Minister will be  seeking to deliver on a Programme for Government. The Assembly, and society in  general, will rely on parties to act in good faith to resolve some of the  difficult residual issues.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If, as speculation suggests, a member of the Alliance Party  takes on the position, that person will not be interested in being merely a  caretaker in office who keeps the seat warm for two years while important  decisions are taken in the outside world. If a Minister from the Alliance Party  were confronted by other parties and placed in a difficult situation, I imagine  that he or she would stand by the policy principles that have already been  agreed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Other amendments in the first group refer to the risk of a  Department of justice collapsing after May 2012 if agreement has not been  reached.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Many Members pointed out the extraordinary predictions of  doom and catastrophe that have come from the SDLP Benches. It was articulated  that there is a fail-safe mechanism. It may not be the most desirable way to do  things, but we must recognise its existence.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Even if we leave aside the current legislation, it is  entirely within the competence of Westminster  to legislate for further steps and protections at any stage at which it wishes  to do so. If we faced a crisis, it would be the height of irresponsibility for  any British Government to stand back. I am certain that, even under a  Conservative Government, that would not happen.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  Perhaps Dr Farry could enlighten us. He referred to the provision in the Westminster legislation  as being a fail-safe mechanism and that at least we could rely on it being  there. Three parties support the Bill: one party told us that there is no  fail-safe or fallback mechanism whatsoever; another party told us that there  is, arguably, a fallback mechansim but that it does not believe that that would  be politically reliable; and Dr Farry said that there is a fail-safe mechanism.  All three parties have different versions. Does that not press the need for the  sort of report that is outlined and required by our amendment?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  sense that we are almost being encouraged to panic at this stage. Many  assumptions are being made about failure. The differences that Mr Durkan  pointed out among parties reflect the SDLP&rsquo;s agenda. Perhaps we should be blunt  and frank about what is happening. From Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s perspective, there is  clearly an agenda to take policing and justice out of the hands of the British  state and place them in the hands of locally accountable politicians in Northern Ireland.  I fully respect that agenda. I understand where that party comes from, and, to  a considerable extent, I agree.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">From my party&rsquo;s point of view, given that we support the  principle of consent &mdash; and, no doubt, from the unionist parties&rsquo; perspective,  given that they support the Union &mdash; we do not have a fear of Westminster&rsquo;s  legislating to provide safeguards for a situation in which the Assembly is in  difficulties. It has happened in the past, and it may happen in the future,  although I hope that that is not the case. I suspect that, behind many of  today&rsquo;s discussions, the issue is not about a report from the First Minister  and deputy First Minister seven days after the Act is passed but about the  intra-nationalist battle over who is delivering on policing and justice and who  is not and trying to paint Sinn F&eacute;in into a corner.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP has played a destructive role, particularly in the  past few weeks, in trying to whip up hysteria over issues and deals that are  being done behind the scenes, or in the open, to undermine A, B and C. That has  not done the SDLP any credit. It certainly has not sped up the process of  devolving policing and justice. If anything, it has created obstacles and  barriers and has stoked up fears.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  The SDLP raised issues, some of which involved criticisms. None of the issues  involved obstacles, barriers or preconditions. Other parties, including the  Alliance Party, create preconditions that stand in the way of the earlier  devolution of policing and justice.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: In  relation to the Parades Commission, the SDLP stands prepared to pounce if Sinn  F&eacute;in gives a chink of light and says anything other than &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. The Member should return to the amendments.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  shall endeavour to return to the matter that is before us. I shall give an  example of Mr Durkan&rsquo;s point about the Bill and the amendments. It is a matter  of record that the SDLP voted against the Second Stage of the Bill. For a party  that nominally supports the devolution of policing and justice, that is  completely illogical.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">7.30 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The consistent thing to do would have been to support the  Bill&rsquo;s Second Stage, which would have amounted to no more than supporting  devolution and the creation of a Department of justice and then have the debate  at Consideration Stage about how to proceed. However, the SDLP voted against  the legislation at Second Stage. If its arguments, if one can call them  arguments, had found favour with the majority of Members, we would not be any  closer to devolution happening; we would be further away. The amendments do not  do anything to advance the devolution of policing and justice; they create  further distractions and obstacles. We are engaged in purposeless political  games.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We must try to be as optimistic as possible about the way  forward. There was a sunset clause in the St Andrews Agreement regarding  devolution. That challenge was met. By debating the devolution of policing and  justice today, we have partly met that challenge. We have already made some  progress, and there is more to be made. If parties find agreement and  devolution happens, the prospects of reaching a further understanding ahead of  May 2012 will be significantly advanced. To a degree, we are talking ourselves  into a false sense of crisis before one occurs.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I shall draw a parallel: the Assembly faces the challenge  of agreeing Budget legislation twice a year. The consequence of failing to pass  that legislation would be that no Departments would have the legal  authorisation to spend money. Perhaps, that is the one scenario in which Alex  Attwood&rsquo;s prediction of things grinding to a halt would come to pass. However,  on every occasion so far, the Assembly has risen to the challenge of passing  the Budget legislation, even in situations in which there were very difficult  and controversial issues to be discussed. Therefore, the Assembly has a  positive track record of meeting the challenge of deadlines for finding fresh  agreements and of banking agreements that have allowed us to make progress  until now.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  In the event of the Assembly not agreeing Budget legislation, the Department of  Finance and Personnel has a reserve power that it can use. I had cause to  research that matter on a particular occasion. Therefore, it would not be a  case of everything grinding to a halt, which is markedly different from the  dissolution provided for in the sunset clause. We do not want to see that come  about, but we did not legislate for it; other people did, and they have to  explain it.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  am grateful to the former Finance Minister for that correction, but that is  another example in which we have a fail-safe. Hence, we need not panic.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Our society is divided. There are contentious issues to  handle, and we are taking steps forward gradually. It is important that Members  see the Bill in the light that it enables us to get over the first major hurdle  towards achieving something that we have not had so far &mdash; the devolution of  policing and justice. Parties have defined their terms for how far they are  prepared to go, and they can find agreement at this stage based only on  temporary, interim provisions. From my perspective of wanting to see the  devolution of policing and justice happen, I think that that is the positive  way to go. Let us get the justice Department up and operational.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We must acknowledge that there are further challenges down  the line. Things may well get rocky, in keeping with the SDLP scenario, but let  us be optimistic that we can sort out the situation. If we cannot do that, the  British Government have step-in powers. Frankly, if there is a sense of crisis  in 2012, the crisis may be much bigger than policing and justice; it might  involve the legitimacy and the continuation of the institutions as a whole. At  that stage, we will have to ask about the fallback position in respect of other  powers.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The notion of a potential crisis is inherent in ours or any  other system. When it comes to the formation of Governments internationally, it  is not unusual after elections to have an interim period during which parties  have to find agreement. If parties cannot agree, the consequences are  potentially severe. Time after time around the world, parties rise to that  challenge, so we must back ourselves to do the job. We must have trust and  faith in ourselves. If we decide to take devolution forward on the basis that  we have to legislate for every contingency for failure, we will damn the whole  project as unobtainable. Given that every party in the Chamber has staked its  political reputation on the success of devolution, such a conclusion would be a  sobering position to reach.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, given that there has been much speculation on the  subject, I wish to clarify the Alliance Party&rsquo;s position, to which my colleague  Naomi Long referred. The Alliance Party is extremely supportive of the  devolution of policing and justice. We want it to happen, and we see strong  rationales for it. Like any other political party or set of political  representatives, we have an interest in ensuring that devolution is done as  well as possible in the circumstances that we find. This legislation allows  that to happen.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a lot of speculation about the Alliance Party&rsquo;s  role. The Alliance Party has not been invited to nominate a Minister, although  that may well be the case in the future. We have not said yes or no to any  offer. The party has made it clear that it is prepared to be constructive, as  it always has been in the Chamber, and that it will do what is in the best  interests of the people of Northern    Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  Surely the Member&rsquo;s party has already said no. Mrs Hanna clarified earlier that  it said no.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: A  lot of parties have created a small industry in interpreting what the Alliance  Party has said. However, let me be clear, on behalf of the Alliance Party,  about what we have said: in the summer of 2008, the Alliance Party said no to a  half-baked situation whereby a Minister could be appointed outside the  Executive, in essence a puppet Minister, something about which so many people  have warned us. The legislation that went through Westminster in March 2009 was categorical  about the fact that, just like any other Minister, the Minister for policing  and justice would be a full member of the Executive. Therefore, that situation  has moved on.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As things stand today, the Alliance Party&rsquo;s judgement will  be based on what is in the best interests of the people of Northern Ireland.  Unlike the SDLP, which has been making a virtue of its entitlement to the  Ministry, the Alliance Party has never advertised such an entitlement. We have  responded to speculation, but we have never chased the post. We have made it  clear that we are prepared to be constructive on the way forward.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party&rsquo;s benchmark for determining what is in  the best interest of the people of Northern Ireland will relate not  only to how the legislation is taken forward today but, when further progress  is made, to whether a Minister is prepared and able to deliver on behalf of  those people. There is no point in a Member from the Alliance Party or from any  other party serving at the top of a Department and being part of the Executive  if he or she has no ability to deliver on policing and justice issues. Frankly,  devolution depends on a continued process of building confidence. Confidence is  not something that will be achieved before devolution; it is an ongoing process.  After devolution, confidence will depend on the system, which includes a  Minister &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind Members that mobile phones and Blackberries are not  allowed in the Chamber.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Confidence depends on the ability of any Minister, the Executive and the  Assembly as a whole to demonstrate the benefits of devolution and how it can  make a real difference to people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I shall conclude by reiterating the point that we have been  stressing: it is critical that, in advance of devolution, as much discussion as  possible takes place and as much agreement as possible is found on the policy  programme for the Department and on what the Assembly and the Executive will be  seeking to do. For Members who have concerns about security of tenure and any  potential puppetry, that is the best safeguard. It is the best signal that can  be given that the Assembly is serious about devolution making a real difference  to people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">This legislation is an important milestone. It gets us from  A to B. There is still a long journey to be made, but it is important that we  take those steps, small as they may be, in the right direction. Unlike other  parties that seek to play a negative role, the Alliance Party continues to play  a constructive role in seeking to find peace, stability and a shared future in  this society.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. It is becoming a very cold House for  unionists. I am not sure whether that affects the whole House, but it affects  the unionist side. Could we have that matter dealt with?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I thought that it was quite warm.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I call the deputy First Minister, Mr Martin McGuinness, who  will probably warm things up.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister (Mr M McGuinness)</strong>: Martina Anderson, who is sitting beside me, has  been shivering for the last hour.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A vicious rumour circulated at the time of the Second Stage  of the enabling legislation on the devolution and transfer of power that Alex  Attwood was going to speak for an hour. In the event, he did. In retaliation,  the First Minister spoke for nearly two hours. After that, I reminded the First  Minister that he lives only five minutes from here, but I live two hours away.  I was horror-struck when someone who lives in the same city as I do, the Member  for Foyle Mark Durkan, began to speak today. As he went on and on, I thought  that he was going to continue until 2012.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">On the serious matter of the business in which we are  engaged, the House should be in no doubt whatever about the purpose of the  grouped amendments that we have been discussing: it is to remove clause 2 from  the Bill, either directly or indirectly. The direct approach is through the  opposition of SDLP Members to clause 2 standing part of the Bill. The indirect  approach is through amendment Nos 1, 2, 3 and 4, the combined effect of which  is to create an unnecessary device of considerable legal complexity that will  effectively add another stage to the legislative process. If those amendments  are successful, the Bill will be returned to the Assembly for review within  days or weeks of its enactment.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Let me remind the House where clause 2 comes from. On 18  November last year, the First Minister and I attended a meeting of the Assembly  and Executive Review Committee. Following that meeting, we made public a letter  that we had issued earlier that day to the Chairperson of the Committee in  which we set out our agreed position on a number of matters, with an  accompanying process paper detailing the steps by which devolution would be  achieved.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In our letter of 18 November and in other corres&shy;pondence  with the Committee at that time, the First Minister and I indicated our  preferred arrangement for appointing a Minister of justice. Our preference was  that the process be one in which nominations would be invited from Members of  the Assembly, and the successful candidate would require the support of the  majority of Assembly Members, present and voting, including a majority of  designated nationalists and a majority of designated unionists voting.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly and Executive Review Committee was clearly  content with that proposal, and that was reflected in the report that it  prepared on the devolution of justice and policing responsibilities. The recomm&shy;endations  in the report deal with the departmental structure, the powers to be transferred  and, crucially for the debate on this clause of the Department of Justice Bill,  the arrangements for appointing the Minister of justice. On 20 January 2009,  the Assembly approved a motion endorsing the Assembly and Executive Review  Committee report. That is the basis for the model of ministerial appointment  set out in clause 2. It is the model originally proposed by the First Minister  and me, and it is supported by the Assembly and Executive Review Committee. The  Assembly approved that model when it considered the matter in January.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">7.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The arrangements for appointing a Minister of justice under  clause 2 are interim arrangements. The First Minister and I made that clear a  year ago when we announced the basis on which we would move towards the  devolution of policing and justice responsibilities. Those arrangements would  last until May 2012, at which point the Department of justice would dissolve  unless the Assembly were to extend those arrangements by resolution or devise  alternative arrangements. Those arrangements were also reflected in the  legislation passed at Westminster  earlier this year.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Before May 2012, the House will have the opportunity to  review the ministerial arrangements and decide whether it would prefer an  alternative. The House will have more opportunity for considered thought on the  matter than the fast-track arrangements that amendments Nos 2, 3 and 4 would  allow for reviewing legislation that it had only just passed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 2 would also compel the First Minister and me  to deliver to the House a report that the amendment conveniently drafts for us.  In response to the heading set out in that amendment, the functions to be  exercised by the Department of justice are those that were identified in the  Assembly and Executive Review Committee&rsquo;s report of March 2008. There is a  sunset clause for the ministerial arrangements in clause 2. It is contained in  schedule 1(8)(1) to the Northern Ireland Act 2009. The consequences of the  dissolution of the Department of justice would be severe, but that is precisely  the incentive for the Assembly to devise permanent arrangements before May  2012. That would be the gist of the report that amendment No 2 would require us  to make. The objective of the report mechanism is to provide a further opportunity  for criticism of the arrangements that the First Minister and I agreed last  November. Those arrangements were reflected in the Assembly and Executive  Review Committee&rsquo;s report of January 2009 and were endorsed by the House at  that time.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly will have much opportunity to debate the  details of the devolution of policing and justice before devolution day. The  resolution request for the transfer of powers will be debated and will require  cross-community support. The determination of ministerial offices will be  brought to the House, and the new justice Minister will be elected by the  Assembly with cross-community support. There is no shortage of Assembly  scrutiny of the process, and I look forward to all those stages.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A number of points were raised during the debate. Alex  Attwood again raised his claim that there is a fallback position that would  prevent the sunset clause from taking effect in May 2012. He rests that claim  on his reading of several sections of the Northern Ireland Act 2009 and the  1998 Act, as amended. The Department does not believe that the provisions that  Mr Attwood relies on could ever have that effect, because the conditions  attached to a Westminster Order in Council to impose a ministerial model would  cease to exist with the passing of the Department of Justice Bill. In effect,  that option among the menu of ministerial models will be spent once the  Assembly legislates.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I understand the point that the deputy First Minister has made. However, I put  two observations to him in reply. The first is that, although he indicated  certainty with respect to the sunset clause, that is, to some degree, in  tension with his own officials. At the OFMDFM Committee meeting of 14 October  2009 which considered the justice legislation, departmental officials said  that, after the Second Stage of the Department of Justice Bill:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;we took the opportunity to consult people who were  closer to the drafting of the Northern    Ireland Act 2009. They stated that it was  never the intention that the interpretation &hellip; placed on the particular  provision would apply to frustrate the operation of the sunset clause. It was  not intended that there would be a hidden fallback mechanism.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The official went on to say that, ultimately, those  matters would have to be decided by a court.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a tension between the deputy First Minister&rsquo;s  certainty on that matter today and what was indicated to the Committee. In any  case, the crucial point is that the deputy First Minister is quite right to say  that the legislative provisions for what a Secretary of State can do will not  apply to the first Department. In the legislation, however, the Secretary of  State reserves unto himself the right to act in respect of a new Department  that would be necessary in the event that, on 1 May 2012, the Department of  justice as it then existed is dissolved. The legislation states that the  Secretary of State reserves power in respect of the new Department that would  be necessary to avoid what the deputy First Minister described as the severe  situation that would obtain in the event of the dissolution of the first  Department in May 2012.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: I thank the Member for his contribution but remind him that Paul  Goggins, during the debate on the 2009 Bill at Westminster in March this year, said:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Bill provides no fall-back position beyond May  2012. Frankly, it is not for us in this place to determine any additional model  beyond that period; it is a matter for the Assembly&hellip;There is no fall-back  position, as I have said, and it is entirely a matter for the Assembly.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">He went on to say:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The parties themselves will have to determine the  model beyond May 2012. We are devolving policing and justice powers; we are not  saying that we are partly devolving them and saving a little for ourselves. The  matter is entirely for those parties.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">He makes it absolutely clear.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP has adopted a doom-and-gloom approach to the  debate. It has been made clear that, as we agree this process, move forward and  put in place a Department of justice and a Minister of justice, there will be a  huge responsibility on the Assembly and the Executive to ensure that we arrive  at a scenario in which we can continue seamlessly in the event of us all being  returned, if we stand in the election of 2011, to see through the process of  ensuring that we have in place arrangements that will ensure that the  dispensing of justice and policing is managed by this Administration.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am not looking at this matter from a doom-and-gloom  perspective or thinking that we will never succeed or that there are 30 months  left and we will never agree on anything. I approach all matters that confront  us in these institutions as a problem solver. If we all apply ourselves to that  business, there is nothing that we cannot accomplish as we move forward and overcome  the obstacles and challenges that lie before us.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Danny Kennedy raised the issue of the justice Minister  being a puppet. The justice Minister, like any other Executive Minister, will  have full legal authority. He or she will be bound by the Pledge of Office and  the ministerial code. Consideration is being given to whether any amendments  will be required to the ministerial code as a result of the devolution of  policing and justice. However, any amendment to the code will come before the  Assembly for approval and will not come into effect without cross-community  support.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Alan McFarland asked what would happen if the justice  Minister was not returned at the 2011 election. The Minister would cease to  hold office, and the Assembly would have to elect another, with cross-community  support. That is effectively provided for in the Westminster legislation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The six amendments that the SDLP has tabled lie at the heart  of this debate. It is my strong view that the SDLP is ignoring the political  reality of the circum&shy;stances that we are dealing with at the moment and that  the transfer of policing and justice powers was never really on the SDLP&rsquo;s  agenda until Sinn F&eacute;in put it there.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I was a Minister in these institutions from December 1999  until October 2002, during the period in which Seamus Mallon and Mark Durkan  occupied the position of deputy First Minister. Not once did I have a  conversation with either of my two colleagues about their views on whether  policing and justice powers should be devolved. I did not hear it mentioned  during any Executive meeting, and I was never invited by the SDLP to a meeting  to discuss the possibility. Indeed, for many years after that, there were no  discussions on the issue. The issue never raised its head from the SDLP&rsquo;s  perspective.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>: I  thank the deputy First Minister for giving way. May I remind him of a  conversation that took place in the office of the deputy First Minister early  in my tenure, which was similar to one that I had with Gerry Adams, the Sinn  F&eacute;in president? During that conversation I indicated that among the options  that I was pursuing in discussions with the First Minister was the possibility  of appointing additional junior Ministers from Sinn F&eacute;in &mdash; the difficult issue  was going to be whether or not there would be any from the DUP &mdash; and of having  an additional adviser as a programme manager for each of the four parties in  the Executive. One issue that I said that I wanted to address in that context  was how to make progress towards the devolution of justice and policing, in the  circumstances where we had the Patten report and the Policing Board in place.  Sinn F&eacute;in was opposed to the Policing Board at that stage and was not prepared  to embrace the debate around the devolution of justice and policing.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: Anybody who looks at the record of that period and at the public  discourse from political parties around what were or were not priorities at the  time will fail miserably to see any effort by the SDLP to raise the issue of  the transfer of power in the way that Sinn F&eacute;in has raised it since we became  the largest nationalist party. I say that because the issue is not important  just for Sinn F&eacute;in. We argue for the need to transfer powers on policing and  justice for the same reason that Ian Paisley gave for doing so in one of the  first meetings that I had with him, and I know that many members of the DUP  concur with this. As a member of a devolutionary party, he believed that local  politicians could do a better job than Ministers who were coming over from England, Scotland  and Wales.  The transfer of policing and justice powers would be a good thing, and I think  that many Members believe that, because all the parties agree with it in  principle. As Carmel Hanna said, it would make a real difference for the people  whom we represent across the community in delivering a better justice system  and a more accessible court system.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As we move forward, we have to be conscious of the fact &mdash;  at least, I am conscious of the facts &mdash; that the SDLP is making a huge mistake.  I say that because, at its rawest, the truth is that, if the SDLP approach were  to succeed, we would never see the transfer of powers on policing and justice,  because the SDLP is ignoring the political realities.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I listened to Alex Attwood&rsquo;s contribution. He said that he  had struggled so long to make this happen. That is a new one on me. We have  struggled to make it happen, and many people in the community who have voted in  election after election have made their own judgements as to who was delivering  on policing and justice and many other issues related to the institutions.  Those people have made their decisions; the people have spoken, and they have  done so powerfully.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  Will the deputy First Minister give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: I will give way in a minute; I do not want to have my train of  thought interrupted. I listened carefully to the Members who were arguing for  the amendments. SDLP Members spoke for something in the region of three hours.  Members gave way to them left, right and centre. I do not have a problem with  that, but it was clear from the initial contributions from SDLP Members that  they were more concerned with the SDLP&rsquo;s entitlement to the justice Ministry.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">When Mark Durkan began to speak, he realised the mistake  that was being made. This was being seen as a selfish demand from the SDLP, and  Mark Durkan tried to move the issue from the SDLP&rsquo;s entitlement to a defence of  d&rsquo;Hondt. At that stage, I was really confused. Mark Durkan&rsquo;s Oxford speech clearly confused an awful lot  of people several years ago and indicated clearly to many that at that time  that the SDLP was prepared to move away from the election processes established  under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement and the St Andrews Agreement.</p>
