                Concern in respect of the motion on the Union flag was tabled
                last evening, before the Business Office closed. Having checked
                the petition, I regard it as fulfilling the requirements of
                Standing Order 27 to allow the vote to take place at the
                conclusion of the debate today. The motion will require
                cross-community support to be adopted.</p>

              </font></b><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Yesterday, at
              the beginning of the sitting, I referred to the victory of Mr Joey
              Dunlop in the Isle of Man TT. <i>[Interruption]</p>
              </i><b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. The musical interlude is unwelcome in
              the Chamber.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I said that we congratulated him and that he
              certainly was the crowned king of the road. I conveyed my personal
              congratulations, and the House was unanimously pleased. In the
              House of Commons the Member representing the area concerned would
              normally express congratulations. Well, I am the Member for Joey’s
              area. I am not a prophet, or the son of a prophet, but he won the
              next day too. So he is indeed the crowned king of the road.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last night it was said on television that the
              matter had not been raised in the House. The Minister concerned
              certainly did not raise it. People — especially people from
              Ballymoney — were ringing my home, irate that the impression had
              been given that the matter had not been raised in the House. You,
              Mr Speaker, know otherwise.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want just to set the record straight so that
              the people of Ballymoney will know. I hope soon to join
              Mr&nbsp;Dunlop as a free man of that great town.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. I can confirm that the matter was raised
              yesterday. It is the first item in Hansard, and I am relieved that
              it is not on the pillion that Dr Paisley will be joining Mr
              Dunlop.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further to that point of order, Mr Speaker. Dr
              Paisley raised the matter with me in the Lobby. It refers to my
              Ulster Television interview with Mike Nesbitt. When I was asked
              why I had not raised the matter in the House I said that it had
              been an oversight on my part. I understood that Mr Nesbitt was
              referring specifically to why I, as Minister of Culture, Arts and
              Leisure, had not raised it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further to what Dr Paisley said — and as I
              said last night — there have been great achievements by our two
              sportsmen, and no one in this House would attempt to deny that. I
              was certainly not suggesting that Dr Paisley had not raised the
              matter yesterday; I was merely agreeing with Mike Nesbitt that I
              personally had not done so.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Morrow:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It says a lot that the Minister is so
              ill-informed about what goes on in the Assembly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also appropriate to mention
              Darren&nbsp;Clarke, not just because he is a native of Dungannon
              but because he is an excellent ambassador with his great golfing
              achievements in recent years.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr&nbsp;Paisley asked yesterday if it would be
              in order to make the comments that he made. He also expressed his
              condolences to the family of Raymond&nbsp;Hanna. I am a little
              concerned, given the success of his point of order, that it could
              become popular for such matters to be raised at the start of
              sittings — not just congratulations but perhaps also the
              bestowal of good fortune for subsequent performances. I am not
              sure that this is within Standing Orders or something that we
              should make a habit of. However, the good wishes of the Assembly
              undoubtedly go to those who have been mentioned.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker, can you please clarify the
              situation with regard to Petitions of Concern. You have indicated
              that you received a Petition and that it has been accepted and is
              open to inspection. Standing Order 27(1) says</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;No vote may be held on a matter which is
              the subject of a Petition of Concern until at least one day after
              the Petition of Concern has been presented.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How do you define &quot;one day&quot; in this
              case? Is it a period of 24&nbsp;hours, or can the vote be held at
              any time the next day? And when was this Petition of Concern
              tabled?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you turn to the interpretation section at
              the back of Standing Orders you will find that &quot;day&quot;
              means a calendar day. It is not necessarily a period of
              24&nbsp;hours. This interpretation was not in initial Standing
              Orders. A petition must be lodged before the Business Office
              closes on the day before the business to which it relates, and
              that is 30&nbsp;minutes after the rise of the House. Thus, the
              timing depends on the time of rising that day. This petition was
              received in due time and was checked by me. The information was
              then sent to all the Whips, though some may not have received it
              before their arrival this morning, having left promptly yesterday.</p>

              alliance of the SDLP and Sinn&nbsp;Féin&nbsp;— it is
              interesting to see all those names together&nbsp;— mean that
              Dr&nbsp;Paisley’s motion, even if endorsed by a majority, will
              fall and that the pan-Nationalist front will be able to prevent
              the Union flag from being flown? Please clarify this for me and
              for the members of the public in the Gallery, Mr&nbsp;Speaker.</p>
              <b>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, the Member must understand that such
              clarification is for the benefit of the House, and not for people
              in the Gallery. It is not appropriate for Members to respond to
              people in the Gallery. Secondly, I trust that the Member is fully
              aware of and very clear about the Standing Orders, though I am
              sure that he and other Members are.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Business Committee decided that two hours
              should be allocated for this debate. Given the substantial
              interest that has been shown and the number of Members wanting to
              speak, I have had to limit the times for this debate and for the
              debate this afternoon. There will be 15&nbsp;minutes for the
              moving of the motion and for winding up. If a Minister wishes to
              respond at the end of either debate, he or she too will have
              15&nbsp;minutes. All other Members will have just five minutes so
              that as many as possible may be facilitated.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I beg to move the following motion:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That this Assembly directs that the Union flag
              shall be flown on Executive buildings in Northern Ireland on all
              designated days, in keeping with the arrangements for other parts
              of the United Kingdom and, additionally, on Parliament Buildings
              on all sitting days.</p>
              </font><b><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Tierney:</p>
              </font></b><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker, when you refer to a Minister who
              can speak for 15&nbsp;minutes at the end of the debate, do you
              mean a Minister representing the Executive? Or is it any Minister?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is only a Minister who is responding on
              behalf of the Executive. It would be normal practice that if the
              Executive wished to respond — and they do not have to do so, as
              all matters may not be within their remit — a Minister would
              make a winding-up speech immediately before that of the mover, and
              he or she would have 15&nbsp;minutes. That would be the case on
              this occasion. I have no indication, at present, that a Minister
              will respond in this debate.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member need not be worried because I
              understand no Ministers will be replying, as they are not in a
              position to speak for a united Executive on this issue.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When I took my seat for the first time in this
              Chamber I never thought I would be here, 30&nbsp;years later,
              having to discuss such a motion. The fact that this motion is
              necessary today proves that concession after concession has been
              given to the pan-Nationalist front, and the names of their
              representatives are on the Petition of Concern. We know who they
              are and we know that their aim and common policy is to divest this
              part of the United Kingdom of all aspects of Britishness.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the main hall of this building there are
              four rings just outside the entrance to the Members’ dining
              room. Two flags used to hang there — the flag of our nation and
              the standard of Northern Ireland. They were taken away. I did my
              best to find out who did it. No one has ever owned up to why they
              were taken away. Having divested the inside of the building of its
              flags the pan-Nationalist front are going to try and divest the
              outside of the building also. This is a growing matter which will
              not go away.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We remember that even in the forum we had
              difficulty with the flag. Of course that difficulty came from
              Mr&nbsp;McGuinness. We had to battle to get the flag put up even
              inside the forum building.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Others on the periphery of the pan-Nationalist
              front are prepared to agree on this issue. We will see today who
              is in agreement and who is not.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The petition can prevent the motion, if it is
              passed, from having any power. That is the veto that has been
              handed to those who want to carry out the Republican agenda in
              this House. It will always be put into use to maintain the
              Executive and those who believe that the way forward for Northern
              Ireland is the Republican way, which is set forth in the
              Agreement. That veto will continue.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.45 am</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The national flag flies upon the Parliament of
              every democratic country in the world. It also flies on the
              regional Parliaments, and there is evidently no objection to that.
              However, in Northern Ireland we find elements who are not prepared
              to allow the wishes of the majority to be the guiding factor. This
              flag issue shows the total and absolute falsehood and hypocrisy of
              the SDLP, Sinn Féin and their allies. They say they believe in
              the principle of consent, and in the consent of the majority of
              the people. The majority of the people in this country want this
              flag to fly. The majority of the people in this country have a
              right to have their national flag flying. It flies by decree of
              the Queen, who directs that this should be done. There are people
              here that strike not only at the flag but also at the sovereign
              and anything that is British. We have an anti-British campaign
              that wants to ensure that the national flag will not fly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The flag also flies, as I pointed out to the
              Prime Minister the last time I saw him, on all sitting days of the
              national Parliament. It used to fly on this Building on sitting
              days, but now we have the first step — it will fly only on those
              sitting days which coincide with the named days. So we already
              have a dilution of the flying of the flag. Let us return to where
              we should never have left. Our flag, the flag of this nation,
              should fly on all sitting days of this Assembly. This is a
              regional Government of part of the United Kingdom, and this
              Assembly is the regional Assembly. Therefore the flag of the
              United Kingdom should be flown. It is puerile to argue that
              another flag should be placed alongside it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The South of Ireland did not need to have any
              argument about this matter. When the border was drawn, 10% of the
              people were Protestant and, in the majority, Unionist, but they
              have been almost eliminated. Today only 2·5% of the population of
              the South are Protestant. As a result, by the elimination of the
              people, they eliminated any bother about which flag should fly. I
              did not hear from the parties opposite a loud cry: &quot;Let both
              flags fly over Dublin castle&quot;. I did not hear that cry,
              because it is the right of the minority. Well, they have very
              little minority left. Perhaps when all the minority has gone they
              will consider that matter.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is puerile for Members to say: &quot;Oh, if
              you fly both flags, we will let you fly them&quot;. Mr&nbsp;McGuinness,
              who is absent today, and the Minister of Health, Social Services
              and Public Safety do not run Northern Ireland. He may run an
              office in Northern Ireland, but he will not dictate to the people
              of Northern Ireland what the national flag is. It is not the
              tricolour. The majority of the people of Northern Ireland — <i>[Interruption]</p>

              it. It is a very dangerous thing to advocate the removal of the
              National flag because it is an issue that goes to the very heart
              of people’s faith and heritage. We are not in the Irish Republic

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not responsible for what people say when I
              give way, but I think that my Friend made a fair point. When we
              are speaking about the Republican agenda, I welcome the fact that
              today in another place, where I hope to be very shortly, Her
              Majesty’s Opposition is going to take the attitude that the
              Police (Northern Ireland) Bill should not get a second reading. We
              are glad, because things are happening in this country and someone
              must put the brakes on the Republican agenda and say &quot;So far
              and no further&quot;.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why are these people offended about the Union
              flag? When they take their pay, are they offended about the Queen’s
              head on the coin, and do they say &quot;No&quot;? We used to have
              an old slogan here — although it does not match with the present
              coinage — that they loved the half-crown but they did not like
              the Crown. It is absolute hypocrisy. Do they want two sorts of
              money?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was a time when they did have two sorts
              of money. There was a hen on some coins. It was wonderful — they
              were loyal to a hen. They can have their choice of animals, but as
              far as this nation is concerned there is one coinage — and I am
              glad that the Euro is doing so badly — and, not only that, there
              is one flag. That is the flag of this United Kingdom.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I could say many other things, but I should
              remark on the statement by the press that the building in which
              the Secretary of State holds office is owned by the Department of
              Health, Social Services and Public Safety. The Minister’s
              directive, which was not even a legal directive, caused the
              Secretary of State not to have a flag flying on his building. He
              is the man that the Executive asked to be the future adjudicator
              on this matter. What trust could we have in the Secretary of State
              to fly the Union flag? None whatsoever.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He was very careful to say, in the House of
              Commons, that the flag will fly while he is around. However, he is
              not going to be around. We know that the talk in Westminster is
              that the Prime Minister wants him back, as quickly as he can, to
              prepare for the election. When he goes, who is going to hold the
              Government to that pledge?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is regrettable that we have to discuss this
              matter. It is an insult to our flag to be told that we have to
              have the flag of another nation flying beside it, a nation whose
              Foreign Minister tells us that there is too much Britishness in
              Northern&nbsp;Ireland and that we have to remove it. He may rub
              out some things on documents — his colleagues are very good at
              that, hence all the investigations into their financial integrity
              — but he will not be rubbing out the loyalty of the people to
              the flag of this nation and the loyalty of the people to their
              roots.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are British and proud of it, and we will fly
              the Union flag irrespective of what motions may be put down and
              what action may be taken by the pan-Nationalist front. We will not
              be bowing the knee to the pan-Nationalist front, and we are not
              going to be subjected to bare flagpoles just because
              IRA/Sinn&nbsp;Féin says we cannot fly the Union Jack. They have
              fired on the flag, they have bombed it, and they have tried to
              destroy it, but it will still fly in spite of them all.</p>

              than a bombastic response.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This motion is about rights. It is about
              equality. It is about what the Human Rights Commission has to do
              to subscribe to international standards and practices that apply
              elsewhere. Indeed, I contend that it is not for the Assembly to
              decide whether or not a flag should fly. It could even be
              reasonably well argued that it is not for the London Government to
              have discretion over whether or not this flag should fly. There
              are international standards that apply in the flying of the flag
              and the recognition of the constitution, and which all, I repeat

              — that somehow this is a cultural issue, as did Conor Murphy.
              This is not cultural.</p>

              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Nesbitt:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Who said that? I read the article in Saturday’s
              ‘News Letter’ where Dr&nbsp;Paisley wrote about the cultural
              rights of the British. See Mervyn&nbsp;Parley for the quotation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is not a concession. It is not cultural.
              It is simply one thing: it is to do with the constitutional status
              of the region of Northern&nbsp;Ireland as part of the United
              Kingdom. That is what it is. In other words, when we deal with
              rights and equality — and this is the fundamental principle
              accepted by all throughout the democratic world — when we deal
              with parity, equality, identity, ethos, aspirations, they are all
              to be subscribed to in equal terms within the context of the state
              already being defined and the constitution already being
              recognised. There is nothing to say about joint sovereignty,
              condominium or the flying of two flags side by side, one of a
              nation state that is a neighbour and one that is ours. That is
              what this is clearly about. The Human Rights Commission — <i>[Interruption]</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am trying to support what you are saying. I
              wish the DUP would keep quiet. Let us take the Human Rights
              Commission, this august body that is meant to define the rights
              that we all have to subscribe to.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.00 am</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The commission asks why we need a Bill of
              Rights for Northern Ireland. It goes on to say that a Bill of
              Rights is needed for Northern Ireland because we have communal
              lines with clearly identifiable majority and minority communities
              — that is our problem. What rights does the commission say it
              must address? Remember that this is the Human Rights Commission,
              not I. It talks of four things: equality, education, language and
              communal cultural rights. I agree with all of those, since they
              are the rights to be addressed given the definition of the state.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The commission goes on to ask where one can
              find such cultural rights to be identified. It says that they can
              be found in the Framework Convention for the Protection of
              National Minorities — namely, the Council of Europe, the home
              for all international standards accepted by all. That is what the
              Human Rights Commission says. What does that framework convention
              say? Let us be unambiguous. It supports rights and equality as
              defined by international consensus — not merely by a small-scale
              Assembly in a region of the United Kingdom. Let me make it clear
              that we are subject to international consensus. It also means
              cultural, linguistic, educational and religious rights of
              equality. Article 20 of the framework convention is unambiguously
              clear in stating — and I end on this point — that there is a
              fundamental principle upon which all other rights are to be based,
              and it is something that is supported by every international
              expert in human rights. Majorities and minorities should respect
              national law and the constitution, which means respecting the
              constitutional position of Northern Ireland as demonstrated by the
              flag.</p>
              <b>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The heat under Members’ collars, clerical and
              lay, demonstrates the depth of feeling already generated on this,
              as we might expect, contentious issue. Fortunately, we seem to be
              leaving the fields of conflict which have scarred the face of our
              countryside and, worse, have seen immense tragedy in our
              communities. It seems the flags which led people onto those fields
              of conflict remain a cause of dissension. If we do not display the
              maturity and sense of responsibility necessary to remove this
              dissension, the very divisions that the Good Friday Agreement
              intended to remove will persist and fester.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to reflect for a moment on the
              significance of flags in order to help our deliberations in as
              positive a way as possible. For me, one flag, the Irish tricolour,
              represents in its green, white and orange colours a very noble
              aspiration — that of peace, reconciliation and unity through
              agreement between the main political traditions of this island.
              However, it is because of what that flag represents that I
              deplore, and have always deplored, its staining with the blood of
              people from either tradition. I have deplored and condemned —
              and my party has done likewise — the activities of those who, in
              the name of the aspiration that that flag represents, have caused
              that blood to be spilt. I equally deplore abuses of the flag,
              evident when it is used to antagonise others, most especially to
              antagonise those with whom the peace, reconciliation, agreement
              and unity it represents are intended to be achieved.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As to the Union flag, I must admit that it
              evokes no warmth in me at all, but as the tricolour evokes in me
              very positive sentiments, I recognise that the Union flag must
              evoke positive feelings in those on the other side of the Chamber.
              However, I have witnessed so many incidents and have learnt of
              many others where it has been used to antagonise, to taunt, and to
              express a sense of dominance over those in the community that I
              and my Colleagues represent. I cannot but question the motives of
              those who are speaking in favour of its display here today. Such
              abuses are very far from the mere expression of the status of
              Northern Ireland, as many protesting in favour of its display
              claim. Indeed, many making this claim are often to be found among
              those responsible for its misuse.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a Minister I have not issued instructions
              regarding the display of the Union flag, or of any other flag, at
              my Department’s buildings. Current practice will therefore
              persist until we arrive at an agreed common position.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Good Friday Agreement urges, I fully
              support the recommendation that we approach this issue with
              sensitivity and seek to develop a common understanding and code of
              conduct for the display of flags and emblems by our new
              institutions. In doing so I believe that we should strive to
              arrive at a situation where we have an agreed set of common
              emblems and flags to represent the institutions agreed to in the
              Good Friday Agreement. For these reasons members of my party and
              others have signed a Petition of Concern to have this issue
              addressed by the Assembly to enable us to pursue agreement on this
              very contentious matter. In doing so, I look forward to the
              assistance that the Human Rights Commission and others may want to
              afford us as we seek such agreement.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have seen this party haranguing church
              leaders. They were at it again last night, haranguing President
              Mary McAleese and the newly elected moderator of the Presbyterian
              Church, Dr Trevor Morrow. Everything they do or say is about
              division, whether it be about flying flags or rotating Ministers.
              That is all they are capable of — promoting sectarianism and
              fomenting civil strife. Do not let this motion fool anyone. Even
              if the Reverend party leader wraps himself in the Union Jack and
              flies it from the top of Westminster, it is not going to stop the
              change which the Good Friday Agreement and 84% of the people of
              this island, North and South, clearly spelt out. It is called
              equality. Do they know what that means? Well, I will tell them,
              for they do not know. It means that the flag I recognise and
              uphold, which represents my political allegiance on this island of
              Ireland and which, in its origins, symbolises the unity of orange
              and green traditions, is entitled to be flown alongside the Union
              Jack on all buildings. That is called parity of esteem and it
              means that where British symbols are used in public life,
              equivalent Irish symbols must be given equal prominence.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All who signed up to the Good Friday Agreement
              acknowledge the need for sensitivity in the use of symbols and
              emblems for public purposes, and the need to use symbols and
              emblems in a manner which promotes mutual respect and human
              rights, rather than division. In circumstances where it is not
              possible to fly both flags, none should be flown. It is the right
              of all of the people on this island that we create and uphold the
              principle of an equal or neutral working environment central to
              parity of esteem but also — and I remind the proposer of this
              motion — enshrined in law.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This issue is not about flags. This issue, and
              the one that we should be debating, are whether we can, through
              the unique formula which is the Good Friday Agreement, involve
              ourselves in the political process which will address the issues
              of rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity. We are back
              again in this Assembly, and we have another chance to further
              develop the peace process. This motion is what we have come to
              expect. <i>[Interruption]</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whilst I do not agree with the Republicans in
              their attitude to the flying of flags in Northern Ireland, my
              party rejects the way in which today’s motion seeks to further
              politicise the use of the Union flag. That is why we sought to
              bring forward a reasoned amendment which would have removed the
              misuse of the Union flag on every sitting day, while leaving the
              current practice for Government buildings on designated flag days.
              That is also why we suggested and signed the Petition of Concern.
              It was not a pan-Nationalist front, Mr&nbsp;Wilson.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are a number of reasons why people fly
              flags. A flag can be used as an expression of identity. In that
              context, if I wish to fly one flag and my neighbour wishes to fly
              a different flag on her property, that is the right of each of us,
              subject only to our keeping the peace. If one of my neighbours
              wishes to put up a Union flag for the Queen’s birthday, another
              wishes to fly St&nbsp;Patrick’s cross on 17&nbsp;March, and I
              want to put up a red dragon every time there is a rugby match in
              the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, that is our right. We should
              have — <i>[Interruption] </i>Was that a point of order?</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No. I am not giving way for anybody. I have
              only five minutes.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With the exception of the emblems of illegal
              organisations, we each should tolerate the other, and, in turn, we
              should have our wishes tolerated. A flag can be flown also as a
              symbol of sovereignty. That is the difference between a private
              house, an Orange hall, or a GAA club, and a Government building. A
              flag on a Government building can only be a statement of
              sovereignty. That is why I cannot see any possibility of the
              tricolour’s being flown alongside the Union flag on any
              Government building, because it does not fit with the principle of
              consent, and it seems to me the logic of the Sinn&nbsp;Féin
              position is that the Union flag should now fly over Rathgael House
              in Bangor in perpetuity. If they wish the tricolour to fly
              alongside the Union flag as a recognition of one section of this
              community, then should there be any possible constitutional
              change, they must accept that the Union flag should fly alongside
              the tricolour forever as a recognition of the identity of another
              section of the community.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third reason for flying flags in Northern
              Ireland is possibly the most important, and that is to get one
              over on the &quot;other side&quot;. That is the mentality that
              nails flags up every available telegraph pole. That is done to
              stake out territory and tell people they are not welcome. The only
              thing that can be said in its favour is that, by and large,
              Republicans do not fly their flag upside down.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today’s motion represents a test of the
              commitment of the different parties to the mutual respect and
              tolerance I spoke of — the respect and tolerance which is
              enshrined in the agreement. I believe that the UUP and the PUP
              should actually oppose the provocative use of their national flag,
              the Union flag. While the proposal to fly the Union flag on this
              building on every sitting day is not quite the same as waving it
              in the streets, or nailing it up telegraph poles, it seems to me
              that the effect is the same. Possibly the intent is the same. It
              is to seek forcibly to remind those who are offended by it that
              they are in a minority. It is to tell them they are not welcome.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many Unionists, indeed many supporters of my
              party, view the Union flag, not as something with which to taunt
              people, which seems to be the aim of many people in this Chamber,
              but as a dignified statement of their beliefs and values. As
              someone who is not a Unionist but who lost an uncle in the fight
              against fascism sixty years ago, I know exactly how deep those
              feelings run, and how sincere they can be. Those people have a
              right to see their symbols treated with respect by everybody, not
              treated as cheap political rags and misused by some.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, sovereignty in the context in which
              we now live is neither absolute nor indivisible. Alliance
              recognises that Northern&nbsp;Ireland is part of a decentralising
              British Isles. To adopt Mrs&nbsp;Thatcher’s famous dictum, it is
              actually now no longer possible to be exactly as British as those
              in Finchley, whether you live in Fishguard, Finvoy or Fortwilliam,
              and, indeed, the way the European Union is now evolving into a
              federal Europe, it is possible that you will soon be almost as
              British whether you live in Frankfurt or Fuengirola.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alliance wishes to see the development of
              common shared symbols which can unite, not divide, our people. In
              the absence of any agreement on new symbols, maintenance of the
              status quo is the best approach at this time. We reject the
              suggestions that the Union flag and the tricolour should be flown
              together. We see this as the route to an apartheid society, one
              which says that there are two sections which are equal, and they
              — like George Orwell’s pigs — are rather more equal than
              every other section.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We want to build a society that is united but
              diverse. We need shared common symbols. The Assembly’s flax
              plant is perhaps the first example. The European flag should also
              be considered since it can be seen as a focus of unity rather than
              division. In the absence of any agreement on a way forward, we
              should maintain the status quo and reject the motion.</p>

              Government buildings. I have here a list of days on which the
              Union flag must be flown under well-established practices. The
              Sinn Féin Ministers’ actions are deliberately provocative and
              appalling. This is an attack on Northern Ireland’s position
              within the United Kingdom. These so-called Ministers have acted
              beyond their authority and must be condemned utterly by the House.
              They have insulted the vast majority of people in Northern
              Ireland. At a time of deep crisis for the National Health Service
              and education, the Sinn Féin Ministers are more interested in
              cheap political stunts such as preventing the flying of our
              country’s flag than in the wellbeing of the people of Northern
              Ireland. Recently, someone in need of a hospital operation had to
              make way for another so-called kneecapping victim. The Sinn Féin
              Health, Social Services and Public Safety Minister is strangely
              silent on that issue.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fact that Sinn Féin Ministers in this
              fundamentally flawed Executive can refuse to fly our country’s
              flag demonstrates that the Belfast Agreement offers nothing to
              Unionists, in spite of the utterances of David Trimble and some
              UUP Members that it copper-fastens the Union. If the prevention of
              the flying of the flag on Castle Buildings — a Government
              building — represents copper-fastening the Union, what would the
              UUP see as weakening the Union? I have here a statement issued by
              the Ulster Unionist Party on 22 May 2000:</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Thanks to our negotiating team, only the

              talk a lot but never deliver, we actually managed to negotiate
              significant and tangible concessions from the Government.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That was written by David Trimble. I ask him if
              the flying of the Union flag is a concession.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SDLP says that there should be mutual
              respect. We have had 30&nbsp;years of bombs and bullets. Where was
              the mutual respect for the Unionist community in that? We hear
              from Nationalists about Union flags and red, white and blue
              kerbstones. What about Republican triumphalism on the Garvaghy
              Road, the Ormeau Road and many other areas where we see tricolours
              and green, white and gold kerbstones? The Government’s
              neutrality has created the ludicrous situation where if
              Nationalists object to the Union flag, under the Belfast Agreement
              it can no longer be flown on Government buildings.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Alliance Party is now part of the
              pan-Nationalist front which today has signed a petition to prevent
              us from voting that the Union flag must be flown. The Union flag
              is flown permanently at Westminster, except during a royal visit
              when the royal standard is flown. It is flown permanently on the
              building used by the Welsh Assembly. It is also flown on occasion
              on the Scottish Parliament’s buildings and Government offices.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Union flag, and only the Union flag, should
              be flown permanently on Parliament Buildings and on all Government
              buildings to bring us in line with the rest of the United Kingdom.
              It is scandalous for a Northern Ireland Office spokesman to say
              that this is a matter for the parties to agree among themselves.
              That attitude is totally unacceptable. I call for a full
              investigation by the House into the comments made by faceless
              civil servants in the Northern Ireland Office. They must be taken
              to task over that unacceptable attitude.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland is an integral part of the
              United Kingdom, yet our British culture and identity continue to
              be attacked. The list is endless: parades, the oath of allegiance,
              the RUC, portraits of Her Majesty. Sinn Féin/IRA even blocked the
              Duchess of Abercorn from visiting St Mary’s Primary School in
              Pomeroy, County Tyrone to promote a cross-community writing
              competition.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The actions of Sinn Féin/IRA Ministers have
              been grossly offensive to all Unionists, whether they voted
              &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot;. They confirm that the Belfast
              Agreement is fundamentally flawed. It is a charter of deceit, and
              those who have been deceived are the misguided pro-Agreement
              Unionists who foolishly trusted the Belfast Agreement. They
              thought the agreement would safeguard their British identity in
              the face of aggressive Irish Republicanism, which is determined to
              impose Irishness on British people.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This debate is about more than flags. It goes
              to the heart of the Belfast Agreement. That agreement was sold to
              Unionist and Nationalist voters with entirely different arguments.
              For Unionists, the agreement was supposed to secure their British
              citizenship after thirty years of Republican terrorism. For
              Nationalists, it was to create a transitional arrangement in which
              Unionism gave ground and of which a united Ireland would be the
              inevitable outcome.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The removal of the Union flag from Government
              buildings by Sinn Féin/IRA is clear evidence of the Republican

              pan-Nationalist front on British culture and identity, I call on
              all Unionists to fly the Union flag on their homes as a clear

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The symbolic nature of flags can be traced back
              to ancient times. They have been used to lead armies to victory,
              and to crown man’s greatest achievements — whether landing on
              the moon or conquering a mountain peak. They have been used to
              claim ownership of vast territories and, of course, they have been
              used in Northern Ireland, as has already been mentioned, to mark
              out territory.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Also, the Romans used flags to identify their
              legions on the battlefield. There has been much talk recently
              about the symbols of the RUC, but flags, particularly the Union
              flag, can stir up emotions that few other symbols can. Since the
              passage of the Act of Union in 1800, the cross of St&nbsp;Patrick
              that so many people want to remember —</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is this a point of order?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Agnew:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will not give way.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since the passage of the Act of Union in 1800
              the cross of St&nbsp;Patrick has been part of the Union flag,
              symbolising the unity of the kingdom. It is perhaps ironic that
              the current problem with the Union flag comes at a time when the
              flag should be flown over Government buildings to celebrate the
              Queen’s coronation in 1953. The Ulster flag, with its
              six-pointed star — one for each county in Northern Ireland —
              and its crown, was created in 1953 for the Queen’s coronation.
              It was a civil flag for Northern Ireland, but its official status
              was abolished when the Northern Ireland Parliament was closed down
              in 1973. Thereafter, the Union flag was made the official flag in
              Northern Ireland. That is a fact.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Flags and Emblems (Display) Act 1954
              outlawed the display of a flag likely to cause a breach of the
              peace — clearly meaning the Irish tricolour — and made it an
              offence to interfere with the display of the Union flag. That Act
              appears to have been repealed in the United Kingdom during the
              1980s.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the Union flag has never been
              officially adopted by law as the national flag of the United
              Kingdom, it has become so by usage — and that is acceptable in
              the strange system that we call the British constitution. The
              Government stated that it is the correct flag for use by British
              citizens. The situation is slightly different at sea, as the
              Government has reserved the Union flag for specific military
              purposes. In fact, it should only be called the Union Jack by the
              Royal Navy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Interestingly, the Flag Institute has published
              the draft of a Flag Act that would confirm in law the Union flag’s
              status as our national flag. It also lays down some specifications
              and a usage code that some Members would be quite happy to see,
              and that has already been mentioned. The institute is lobbying to
              have the document put before Parliament in time for the
              bicentenary of the United Kingdom and the current Union flag in
              2001. On 26&nbsp;May Peter&nbsp;Mandelson said that those who
              attacked the agreement played on the fears that it would diminish
              their identity and undermine their tradition. He claimed that it
              did no such thing, and that it cherished diversity, securing
              British identity while recognising and respecting Nationalists and
              Republicans who do not share that identity.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I suggest that one of the most potent symbols
              of our Britishness is the Union flag, and if any attempts are made
              to diminish it, to discredit it, or to take it down, then that is
              taking away from the consensus part of the so-called Belfast
              Agreement. I would have thought that the consent principle was
              recognising the rights of the majority of the people in Northern
              Ireland who wanted to retain their British citizenship.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.30 am</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But, at a stroke, when one starts pulling down
              the Union flag one is taking away, in a very symbolic way, the
              essence of that consent principle — the right of the people to
              determine their future under the flag of the British Crown.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The ‘Belfast Telegraph’ of 26 May said of
              the agreement:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The reality is that it seeks to establish

              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Where are the consensus, equality and mutual
              respect when the Union flag is not acceptable? We demand from all
              Members a basic civility towards the flag and symbols which
              reflect the fact that they are living in, and indeed some are
              governing, a part of the United Kingdom.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ervine:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am minded of those who are determined to make
              me respectable in a world that is not respectable. I have been
              listening to guffaws and hee-haws all around me on what is an
              extremely serious and difficult subject. Many within the
              Nationalist community hear those guffaws and hee-haws, and
              yesterday they witnessed, as one Member said, an opportunity to
              destroy or cause serious wounding to that &quot;fundamentally
              flawed Executive&quot; as he lifted his papers and left. It was by
              leave of the Assembly that they could have inflicted serious
              damage and refused to do so.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So when the Nationalist community interprets
              from guffaws and hee-haws the real truth that the huffers and the
              puffers have no intention of pulling the house down, they should
              not misunderstand that as being the view and the will and the
              attitude of the people in our society.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Flags, as has already been said, give rise to
              serious concern. People fight all over the world about them. We
              would have fought over them, and probably did in many ways, prior
              to Good Friday, April 1998. But when we look at the issue of the
              Union flag being flown on public buildings in our society we
              should be minded that this is not pre-1998 — it is post-1998.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a politician — and some would say that I
              am still an amateur one — I have represented a group of people
              whom many here may not like, and even the Members to my left may
              not like them. Those people comprised the Combined Loyalist
              Military Command. They predicated a ceasefire on six specific
              principles. One of those principles was that there was to be no
              diminution of the Britishness of Northern Ireland, provided, of
              course, that such was by the will of the people. Well, the
              Britishness of Northern Ireland has been copper-fastened as the
              will of the people.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whether we like it or not, we once heard
              Gerry&nbsp;Adams talk about embracing his Protestant brothers and
              sisters. I suppose the outworking of the Good Friday Agreement is
              that he accepted that he would have to embrace his British
              brothers and sisters.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom,
              and Dermot Nesbitt is absolutely correct when he divorces the
              flying of the flag on a public building from an expression of
              culture. It is not an expression of culture; it is a specific
              constitutional statement that reflects the terms of the Good
              Friday Agreement on Northern Ireland’s constitutional position.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is in many ways a foolishness about the
              debate and about the Petition of Concern. There is a foolishness
              abroad that makes us forget that in 1966 a flag had to be removed
              from the offices of Sinn Féin — I might once have described it
              as the IRA, and then it became the Official IRA. There was a
              demand for that flag to be removed using the public order
              legislation, and, of course, those people who were responsible for
              that are sitting not very far away from me.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That flag, by the way, was not removed by the
              state. I know the identity of the person who did it, but, of
              course, I have to be careful as there is no statute of limitations
              in Northern Ireland. I know the person who broke the window and
              took the flag out at the behest of those who were bellicose
              ranters demanding that either the state do it, or they would. Then
              that flag was replaced by hundreds of flags.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Surely that is the lesson. It seems quite
              ludicrous that the flag that was taken was the flag of the Irish
              Republic: the tricolour. Those people who say that the tricolour
              is their flag are creating exactly the same difficulties when they
              demand that the Union flag does not fly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They are creating a head of steam, they are
              creating a sense of anger and bitterness. They are reminding us of
              the 72 days in which we had an Executive and in which we had
              Carrickmore and Pomeroy. We had the circumstances of the debacle
              of an attempt, quite legitimate under the Good Friday Agreement,
              to extradite Angelo Fusco. We had all of that in-your-face
              pathetic politics by the Republican movement outside this Building
              and, indeed, some not very sensible things inside this Building.
              If it is to be delivered to the people of Northern&nbsp;Ireland
              — including the Combined Loyalist Military Command — and
              accepted by Unionists, the expression of Irishness contained in
              the Good Friday Agreement has to be dealt with on a proactive
              basis. This expression of Irishness would appear to mean, as far
              as the Nationalist representatives are concerned, the diminution
              of the Unionist position in Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We in the Women’s Coalition are very aware of
              the highly sensitive nature of this debate. We do not approach it
              lightly. On the contrary, we understand that the issue of flags,
              emblems and symbols of our culture, our political aspiration or
              our constitutional status is a fundamental question which lies at
              the very core of the new arrangements we are putting in place. It
              is exactly because this issue is important that we believe it
              should be the subject of serious studied debate over time and not
              of a simple show of hands on the floor of the Assembly or a
              30-second sound bite to satisfy a media hungry for controversy. In
              the House of Commons last month the Secretary of State said the
              issue of flags was best resolved by the Northern&nbsp;Ireland
              Executive, and we agree. In the event of a dispute the Secretary

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We believe this should provide the space
              necessary for us to work our way into this unique fledgling
              democracy and give us time to build the ground we have in common,
              rather than that which divides us.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Good Friday Agreement clearly recognises
              the fact that, while the sovereignty of the United&nbsp;Kingdom is
              maintained through the will of the majority of the electorate in
              Northern&nbsp;Ireland, such sovereignty will be exercised in the
              context of the</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;just and equal treatment of the identity,
              ethos and aspirations of both communities&quot;.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In other words, the expression of sovereignty
              should be managed in such a way that it is both sensitive and
              sympathetic to those who do not hold similar aspirations. Why, for
              example, do we insist that symbols automatically follow
              sovereignty? Do we lack the confidence to know who we are without
              having to rub each other’s noses in it? This is not about the
              reduction of Britishness or Irishness; it is about learning to
              live together. This may not be a marriage, but it is a
              cohabitation of sorts. Everyone knows that when you live together
              in partnership, you have to make compromises. If one partner wants
              to paint the front of the house one colour and the other partner
              wants to paint the front of the house another colour, the best and
              only way to achieve harmony is either not to paint the house at
              all or to choose a colour which is neutral and which is
              acceptable, not just to both but to all who live in that house.</p>

              I am sad that Mr&nbsp;Ervine is away because I noticed that he was
              clearly smarting from the skilful planning of the DUP in the
              Assembly yesterday — he could not hide his disgust and his
              disappointment that we allowed the finances to go on. He wanted us
              to hurt the ordinary people, to rob money from the farmers and to
              stop the operations for patients. It would have given him pleasure
              to have stopped the schools for the children. We intend, as a
              party, to make the Executive bite the dust, not the ordinary,
              decent, law-abiding people of this country.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What we are reaping today are the fruits of the
              Belfast Agreement. We are seeing concession after concession. The
              pan-Nationalist front has its begging bowl out more and more, and
              it is getting cheekier.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We heard from a Member from Londonderry. I
              cannot understand why she would be angry about the Union flag. Did
              her husband not fight under the Union flag? Was he not glad, as a
              member of the Ulster Defence Regiment, to fight under the Union
              flag and be a part of the country?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps because of the embarrassment of her
              past, she is trying to impress her new credentials upon those whom
              she now wants to embrace her. It ill becomes people to try to
              pretend something rather than face the realities.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The sad reality is that we are having an
              anti-British campaign, not only from without but from within the
              Executive. And who put them in the Executive? Members of the
              Ulster Unionist Party, as part of the Belfast Agreement, voted
              them in — and put them back in just recently —ensuring that
              Martin would be the head of education and Barbara Brown would be
              head of health, both running Departments.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Interestingly enough, while they condemn
              Britishness, it was their two Departments that received more money
              from the British exchequer recently. It was education and health
              that got the injection of money from the British exchequer. Of
              course, who could better hold out their begging bowls than
              Republicans — that is how they have lived and practised all
              their years.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It seems to be politically correct today not to
              put up a photograph of Her Majesty the Queen — that is not
              allowed. You cannot walk freely down Her Majesty’s highway; you
              cannot fly the flag of your country; you cannot take an oath of
              allegiance to the Queen. On and on the concessions go, and it is
              rather empty for Members of the Ulster Unionist Party to bleat
              empty phrases of horror when it comes to this issue because this
              is a part of their agreement — they had the power to stop it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The agreement was sold on falsehood. There were
              three principles. First of all we were told the consent principle
              had been settled, and settled forever. All those who signed up to
              the agreement had signed up to the principle of consent; they had
              accepted, acknowledged and embraced the fact that
              Northern&nbsp;Ireland was a part of the United&nbsp;Kingdom. What
              utter rubbish. The people were sold a lie, and we are reaping the
              harvest of that lie.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, there was the Royal Ulster
              Constabulary. The name and the badge were solved in the piece of
              paper that Mr Taylor held in his pocket. Yet in a meeting with
              Mr&nbsp;Ingram — and my party leader was there — the Minister
              said that the name of the gallant RUC would not appear in the long
              or short title of the Bill coming before Parliament today.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.45 am</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In fact Mr&nbsp;Ingram said the issue was
              spurious. That was his answer. That is a second principle, a
              second lie that was sold to the Unionist population.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third was about the flag. We were told that
              the Hillsborough Agreement had settled this issue. The reality is
              that the IRA has tried to take down the Union flag of this country
              with their bombs and their bullets. Thank God the people of Ulster
              are made of better stuff, for they have withstood the bombs and
              the bullets of terrorism. If we were able to withstand all that,
              we certainly are not going to allow anyone to take down our
              country’s flag.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are faced with the harvest of the Belfast
              Agreement. Sadly, the only flag that the Ulster Unionists have
              unfurled in the negotiations is the white flag of surrender to the
              Republican/Nationalist agenda. The Unionist population are now
              reaping the harvest of such ill-informed negotiations. We the
              Ulster Democratic Unionist Party, believe that the flag should be
              flown over this Building on every day the Assembly is sitting and
              in every Government building.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This motion is to do with a very important
              issue. It can be separated into two parts. The first concerns the
              Union flag’s being flown over Executive buildings, and the
              second being its flown on Parliament Buildings on all sitting
              days. I agree with both points but will address them separately.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should refer to the agreement made on Good
              Friday, as it is quite clear on constitutional issues. Paragraph
              1(i) of this section states that the British and Irish Governments
              will</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;recognise the legitimacy of whatever
              choice is freely exercised by a majority of the people of Northern
              Ireland with regard to its status&quot;.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In paragraph 1(iii) the participants endorse
              their commitment to acknowledge that</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the present wish of a majority of the
              people of Northern Ireland, freely exercised and legitimate, is to
              maintain the Union and, accordingly, that Northern Ireland’s
              status as part of the United Kingdom reflects and relies upon that
              wish.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is the consent principle. To reinforce
              this and back it up the Irish Government altered articles 2 and 3
              to remove their legal claim under constitutional imperative. It
              is, therefore, for the people of Northern Ireland to determine the
              constitutional status of Northern Ireland, an issue that has
              separated us for 80 or 90 years. It is quite clear what that wish
              is; Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom because the
              people of Northern Ireland so determine, and for no other reason.
              That is where we are. Northern Ireland is part of the sovereign
              United Kingdom — part of the British state — and the
              constitutional symbol, not the cultural symbol, of that state is
              the Union flag.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the United Kingdom as a whole the Union flag
              is flown on designated Government buildings on designated days.
              That is the constitutional symbol; it is a legitimate expression
              of the constitutional position of the United Kingdom as a whole
              and a legitimate expression of the constitutional position of
              Northern Ireland in particular.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Féin has failed to accept and recognise
              that and to deny the agreement that is at the root of this. If
              Sinn Féin and Nationalists are genuine about wanting the
              tricolour to fly over this building, there is only one way that
              could be done, and that would be to persuade the people of
              Northern Ireland to vote Northern Ireland out of the United
              Kingdom and into a united Ireland. The reason they are denying the
              consent principle is that they now understand that that is a
              possibility so remote as to be politically unachievable, certainly
              in their lifetimes. If they thought there was any possibility of
              achieving that within a set period — Gerry Adams talked about
              15&nbsp;years — if they had some form of stepping stone, then
              they would be reinforcing the consent principle. The dangerous
              aspect is that if they do not accept the consent principle, why
              should Unionists? If they ever achieved a majority, are we
              supposed to accept that? Why should we accept it when they do not?
              They understand this, but they deny it, because they know that the
              chances of the people of Northern Ireland voting Northern Ireland
              out of the United Kingdom and into a united Ireland are so remote
              as to be unlikely to occur within the lifetime of any of us here.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Union flag is flown as a constitutional
              symbol. Within the agreement we have said that symbols will be
              used sensitively. You talk about parity of esteem. Parity of
              esteem means equal respect—but it does not mean recognition.
              There is a difference between respect and recognition.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we are serious about the agreement, and if
              we are serious about this consent principle that is the
              fundamental cornerstone of the agreement, then there should be no
              problem with anyone operating what has been a custom and a
              practice. There is no legal basis for flying the flag, and it does
              not fly by royal prerogative. It is flown throughout the United
              Kingdom by custom and practice. If Sinn&nbsp;Féin and Republicans
              are determined to deny this, then they are denying the fundamental
              cornerstone of the agreement and they are denying the agreement
              itself.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I believe that Unionism and Unionists will take
              that as a serious —</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When Mr McCrea rose sporting his yellow tie I
              thought, for one lovely moment, he was half way there. However, he
              began to talk about begging bowls. Earlier his party leader talked
              about coins. Perhaps at the end of this debate we should have a
              silent collection. That might solve the problem.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was most impressed by yesterday’s business
              in this Chamber when all parties present demonstrated that they
              could, if they wished deliver normality and a future that offers a
              stable and peaceful way ahead. I have no doubt about that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It seems an awful pity that, only one day
              later, we are plunged back into a fruitless debate about flags. We
              should learn from past experiences that these issues are divisive
              and pointless until we reach agreement. Indeed, this motion can
              serve no purpose because the Assembly has no power to direct
              Ministers.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the past 30 years, flags have played a big
              part in marking out territory, denoting difference, and
              heightening tensions. There are people in this House who are past
              masters at using flags for their own narrow, sectarian motives. On
              no occasion can I recall flags being used as a vehicle for
              reconciliation. David&nbsp;Ervine referred to one of the most
              notorious incidents involving flags, which took place in Divis
              Street 34 years ago when the presence of a tricolour caused so
              much offence to Dr&nbsp;Paisley that the Unionist Government sent
              the RUC to fetch it. The rest is history, but for those who are
              too young to remember, shortly afterwards loyalists murdered two
              Catholics — John&nbsp;Patrick&nbsp;Scullion and Peter&nbsp;Ward.
              Matilda&nbsp;Gould, a Protestant, also died a short time later.
              Today 34 years later — with more than 3,500 people dead —
              Dr&nbsp;Paisley is still obsessed with flags, forgetting nothing,
              and learning nothing, from the horrors of the past.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In a divided society it is inevitable that
              flags serve no purpose other than to perpetuate division, fear and
              suspicion. Whether those flags are on Government buildings, nailed
              to telegraph poles, or painted on kerb stones, they serve only one
              purpose; to further sectarianism and polarisation. They are not
              there out of respect.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Surely there is enough intelligence in this
              House — I believe that there is — to base our decisions on the
              experience of the past in relation to flags. We do not have to
              repeat Divis&nbsp;Street, or write another volume of ‘Lost Lives’.
              Surely, we must know that it is much better to discover the common
              ground that unites us, rather than to dwell on the issues which
              serve only to cause fear, mistrust, and perhaps even a return to
              the past.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We only live on this planet for a short time,
              far too short to see the bigger picture. Perhaps in the future
              there will be common ground that will enable progress on this
              issue. In such circumstances would it not be nice if the present
              generation was written into history as having laid the foundation
              stones for development? Then, a future generation could respect
              the flag that evolves out of the present peace process; and the
              work of this Assembly. The flag would be put up at dawn, and taken
              down at dusk. It would be respected by all, and it would be part
              of a heritage of which all our people could be proud.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the meantime, it is best to concentrate on
              the present and continue building the foundation stones of trust
              and reconciliation. It would be better perhaps to leave it to
              future generations, when they have the experience of time and the
              opportunity to see the bigger picture, to decide the format of the
              piece of cloth that flutters from the flagpoles. As long as it
              causes division, a flag is only a piece of cloth.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Flags should be capable of being honoured and
              respected by all, and not used as floorcloths by people who carve
              their political existence out of division and bitterness. When we
              accept that fact and begin the serious business of reaching
              agreement based on consent, then we will be singing from the same
              hymn sheet and perhaps flying flags from the same flagpoles. In
              the meantime, the SDLP has no proposals for flying the tricolour
              on the Queen’s birthday. That would cause even more confusion
              and create even more theme parks of flags denoting difference and
              division.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those comments go to the very heart of the

              inception.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The occasion for those remarks, as I am sure Dr
              Paisley will recall, was a flag flying in a shop window in Divis
              Street. The flag was so obscure that you had to stop at the shop
              window to see it. Yet Ian Paisley gathered a mob, Unionism
              succumbed to his threats, and the flag was taken from the window.
              Four days and four nights of bloody riots ensued in which hundreds
              of men, women and children were injured, some seriously. It was a
              shameful climbdown by the then Government in Stormont, and if
              Unionism wants to look to the genesis of the past 30 years, they
              might examine what happened in Divis Street in 1964. Indeed, the
              ‘Irish Times’ editorial of 5&nbsp;October of that year opined</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The tricolour, however, did not appear to
              worry the authorities overmuch; they showed restraint and good
              sense. Then came a man in black, a man of God, bringing not peace,
              but the sword.&quot;</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was the sword that was used metaphorically
              and in other ways to bedevil this society.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This issue is not about flags or the flying of
              flags. It is not about the flying of a flag as a symbol of
              cultural identity or as a symbol of Britishness. It is for
              Nationalists a denial of their right to their identity in the
              society in which they live. If 100 out of 100 people living in
              this society were Unionists there would be no problem about the
              flying of the flag. However, that is not the political reality
              which exists in this society where 50% of the people are
              Nationalists and where the majority of school-going people of this
              part of Ireland are Nationalist/Republican.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not about the flying of a flag. It is not
              about the flying of a flag to remind us of our Britishness. Those
              who view Unionism as having rights must accept that Nationalists
              also have rights. They must acknowledge that the rights of
              Unionists have responsibilities to the rights of Nationalists.
              Unionists have to come to terms with a number of facts contrary to
              their belief that the North is like any other part of the United
              Kingdom. The Good Friday Agreement is evidence and proof that it
              is not.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Consent is a two-way street. That means that
              our consent is of equal validity and has equal integrity. Is the
              Unionist position, as seen in the spirit and letter of this
              motion, to remain the same — that the exercise of power by
              anybody other than themselves is a concession and not a right? Is
              power-sharing to fail because DUP Unionism, allied with
              anti-agreement UUP Unionism, views the exercise of power by
              Nationalists as unacceptable? Is the price of the Good Friday
              Agreement for Unionists not that the democratic deficit, which
              excluded Nationalists from expressing their culture, religion and
              social identity, is to be remedied?</p>

              the political implications that that entailed, as a concession and
              not a right. This motion goes further by making the exercise of
              power by Nationalists conditional on them emasculating the

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, the fact that we have to debate and
              argue about whether the national flag should be flown on
              Government buildings in Northern&nbsp;Ireland is an indictment of
              the situation into which the Belfast Agreement has brought this
              part of the United&nbsp;Kingdom.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are told that the Belfast Agreement
              strengthens the Union and the position of Unionists. It is ironic
              that if the Ulster Unionist Council had not reinstated the Belfast
              Agreement a few days ago the national flag would have flown on
              Government buildings last Friday. The reality is that, as a direct
              result of that vote to proceed with the agreement, the national
              flag has been torn down at the behest of two Sinn Féin/IRA
              Ministers.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We were told, as part of the package to
              persuade and con people, that members of the UUC should vote in
              favour of the motion, and that a number of issues had been dealt
              with. We were told that the decommissioning issue had been dealt
              with. Of course, we know that IRA/Sinn Féin has been admitted
              back into Government positions without handing over one piece of
              illegal weaponry and without being required at any time in the
              future to hand over such weaponry. We also know that there has
              been no safeguard whatsoever regarding the preservation of the
              name of the RUC or in relation to some of the most fundamentally
              obnoxious parts of the Patten report. Those obnoxious parts will
              proceed. The RUC’s name will be taken away, and the assurances
              given by Mr&nbsp;Taylor and others amount to nothing.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What assurance and resolution were we told
              would ensure the issue of flags was sorted out? It was that that
              power would be given to the Secretary of State — not in
              legislation to require the flying of the national flag, which is
              what should have happened, but to whoever he or she might be at
              any time.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is ironic that one of the reasons
              Mr&nbsp;Trimble and others argued we should proceed with
              devolution, the Belfast Agreement, and letting IRA/Sinn Féin back
              into Government, was in order to take power out of the hands of
              the British Government — since that was joint rule, and since
              Mandelson could not be trusted. Yet they have handed power over
              the flying of the national flag to Peter&nbsp;Mandelson. That is
              some assurance and some logic.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The reality, of course, is that the national
              flag has been torn down. It is not a symbol of party politics, or
              of a particular group or section. It is the national flag. I
              listened with incredulity to the talk from the other side of the
              House about looking to the future and equality. Most of their
              speeches have comprised looking back to the past over
              35&nbsp;years and blaming people for instigating the troubles. I
              listened to Sinn Féin/IRA’s talk of equality and respect —
              was that what the murder campaign for 30&nbsp;years was about? Is
              that why they tried to murder my Colleague and I? Was that a
              contribution to democracy and respect? Let us address the reality
              here. Let us get away from semantics and rhetoric and realise that
              these people have not changed, otherwise they would have been
              prepared at least to begin the process of handing over their
              illegal terrorist weaponry, rather than hanging on to it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They talk about consent and the principle of
              consent that we are told by Mr&nbsp;Trimble and his Colleagues was
              recognised in the Belfast Agreement. Well, here is the outworking
              of that principle of consent — the national flag can be torn
              down. Here is the great accountability that we were told that
              Ministers would have toward the Assembly. As we said they would,
              Ministers have full executive responsibility over the Departments
              that they control, and that is why they have handed power to
              McGuinness and the Minister of Health to tear down the national
              flag.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Mandelson made it clear that the
              legislation made no provision for the flying of the national flag
              over this building. Even if Mr&nbsp;Mandelson issued a directive
              that flags should fly over all Government buildings, that would
              not apply to Parliament Buildings, Stormont. Members and the
              general public need to be aware of that. The so-called safeguard
              that was introduced does not actually apply to this building.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We in this House are determined to ensure that
              wherever possible the national flag flies on appropriate buildings
              on appropriate days, and we stand by that.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Adamson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now for something a wee bit different. Ulster
              has a unique position, set as it is against the face of Britain
              across a narrow sea and separated from the rest of Ireland by a
              zone of little hills, so the characteristics of our language and
              our people have been moulded by movements large and small between
              the two islands since the dawn of human history.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The difference between Ulster and the rest of
              Ireland is one of the most deeply rooted, ancient and, from a
              literary point of view, most productive facts of early Irish
              history. Ulster’s bond with Scotland and Britain as a whole
              counterbalances her lax tie with the rest of Ireland. We need but
              think of the kingdoms of the ancient British Cruthin in both
              areas, and of the Ulster Scottish kingdom of Dál Riada from the
              last quarter of the fifth to the close of the eighth century. We
              can think of Irish relations with the kingdom of the Hebrides and
              Argyll from the twelfth century on and, particularly, of the
              immigration of Hebridean soldiers, gallowglasses, from the
              thirteenth century to the sixteenth century, which led to the
              Gaelic revival. There was a constant coming and going between
              north-eastern Ireland and western Scotland. The Glens of Antrim
              were in the hands of the Scottish MacDonalds by 1400, which is why
              we have Alasdair with us today, and for the next 200&nbsp;years
              Gaelic-speaking Scots came in large numbers. The often-quoted
              seventeenth century immigration of numerous Scots need not be
              considered outside the preceeding series, bringing of course
              yourself, Mr&nbsp;Speaker. There has been movement of people
              between the two islands ever since.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yet to me the denial by Nationalists and
              Republicans of the essential Britishness of Ireland in general and
              Ulster in particular must be considered a root cause of the
              conflict here in Northern Ireland. Ireland was British in the
              second century, and Ulster was British until at least the
              beginning of the fifth century of the Christian era. The third and
              fourth centuries in Ireland, or little Britain as it was known to
              the Greeks and Romans, are extremely remarkable for the unusually
              rapid development of the Gaelic language, which was originally
              brought to Ireland by Spanish invaders. This is evidenced by the
              passage of loan words used by the native British population into
              Gaelic, which itself means raider or barbarian in old British. The
              name Ireland is pre-Celtic, but Glasgow is old British or Welsh
              for green hollow, and Paisley is old British or Welsh for
              basilica, or church of Christ.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For many ordinary Unionists today our British
              heritage in all its aspects, ancient, medieval and modern, is
              represented by the Union flag. The attempted neutralisation by
              some Nationalists and Republicans therefore represents for them a
              worrying expression of anti-British sentiment and the fundamental
              denial of their civil rights and liberties.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Surely it would be much better to listen to the
              words of Seamus&nbsp;Heaney when he says in the introduction to
              his great Irish epic ‘Buile Suibhne’ — ‘Sweeney Astray’:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;It is possible, in a more opportunistic
              spirit, to dwell upon Sweeney’s easy sense of cultural affinity
              with both western Scotland and southern Ireland as exemplary for
              all men and women in contemporary Ulster, or to ponder the thought
              that this Irish invention may well have been a development of a
              British original.&quot;</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like many in the House, I have a sense of
              déjà vu in relation to this issue, particularly given the
              remarks of Assembly Member Cedric&nbsp;Wilson this morning in
              which he referred to the Petition of Concern as being &quot;the
              product of the pan-Nationalist front&quot;. Of course it is not
              the product of the pan-Nationalist front. The Alliance Party and
              the Women’s Coalition are also involved. I remind
              Cedric&nbsp;Wilson that, on another occasion in the House —
              indeed, on 17&nbsp;January — he, along with the Ulster
              Unionists, the DUP and Sinn Féin went into the Lobbies against
              the SDLP on a reasoned amendment in relation to this issue of
              flags. The SDLP, on that occasion, put forward an amendment that
              sought to put this issue where it should be — at the heart of
              the Good Friday Agreement. This is where this issue should be
              dealt with, within the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We as a party have not used or abused our
              Ministries as party political property, we have not given orders
              to civil servants in relation to raising or lowering flags. No
              order has come from SDLP Ministers in relation to this. We reject
              the concept of Ministries being silos that are party political
              property. The SDLP believes that this issue, like all other
              contentious issues, should be brought to the Assembly. It should
              be thrashed out in the Executive, and we should try to reach
              agreement. That is the approach of our Ministers. We did not take
              unilateral action, nor do we intend to. We intend to move forward,
              to try to reach agreement on this most contentious issue. The
              importance of this issue is recognising that within the Good
              Friday Agreement, all these contentious issues are, in fact, being
              addressed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dermot Nesbitt, in his address to the House,
              said that Unionists argue that the Union flag should be flown
              because the principle of consent means that Northern&nbsp;Ireland
              is part of the United Kingdom. That is a simplistic view of the
              agreement. It is a simplistic view of the flag issue. It is an
              incorrect reading of the agreement.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No, I will not because my time is short. The
              principle of consent is only one of the six principles on
              constitutional arrangements for Northern Ireland laid down in
              international law and in the Good Friday Agreement. There are five
              others, including, importantly, an affirmation that, whether
              Northern Ireland remains part of the United Kingdom or not, there
              will be</p>

              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Furthermore, the agreement recognises the right

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is therefore simplistic to say that the flag

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, there are three ways of addressing the
              contentious issue of flags. First, you could do it on the basis of
              equality. Secondly, you could do it on the basis of total
              neutrality.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, you could do it on the basis of trying
              to create and achieve consensual, common symbolism. The latter
              approach was taken by this Assembly when it was initially set up,
              when it embraced the flax flower as its motif, as its logo. That
              was a step in the right direction, and that is the step which I
              and my party believe you should try to follow. Surely that is a
              reasonable approach; surely it is reasonable to try to unite
              people rather than divide them.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I speak in support of the proposal. I have
              received a lot of correspondence on this issue through my advice
              centre, by phone and by letter. The meaningfulness of the Union
              has given us the freedom to express our identity and culture
              without malice and within the confines of the law of the land. The
              truth of the matter is that pan-Nationalism does not understand
              the concept of the Union and has no wish to do so. Their political
              philosophy does not seek to include but rather to exclude. It is a
              profoundly elitist ideal in which those who do not fulfil their
              anti-British or Gaelic/Irish agenda have no part to play. It can
              not, therefore, be surprising that a movement which seeks to
              destroy the constitutional wishes of the majority should also
              challenge the authority of the sovereign Government as represented
              through the flag of the Union. This lack of democracy is no better
              illustrated than by IRA/Sinn Féin’s actions in challenging the
              Crown in Northern Ireland and removing the flag of the sovereign
              Government from Government buildings. They have done this because
              it represents all that these people detest: freedom, liberty and
              justice for all.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Their agenda also purports to see freedom,
              liberty and justice for all — but only if you fit their bill.
              Thirty years of murder is a very real reflection of what will
              happen if you do not comply. They have represented a political
              philosophy which belongs in the Dark Ages, one that is founded on
              hatred, sectarianism, cultural apartheid and intimidation. Of
              course, it is the individual’s democratic right to peacefully
              espouse whatever political opinion he or she desires.
              Unfortunately the problem for Irish Nationalism is that it has
              always been both associated with and wedded to armed terror and to
              the physical eradication of all things British, including those
              who remain loyal to the Crown and to the principles of the Union.
              Members of the SDLP, of course, will probably take exception to
              some of these remarks. However, the fact of life in Ulster
              politics is that the SDLP now exists merely to give credibility to
              the actions of IRA/Sinn Féin. They have always operated from a
              position of apparent moderation, making conciliatory noises on the
              back of IRA/Sinn Féin activity, safe in the knowledge that they
              are not preventing the progress of their common agenda; the
              removal of all things British, including the right to fly the flag
              of the Government on Government buildings.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SDLP preach inclusion and the need for
              cross-community co-operation yet practice exclusion. Their actions
              on Down District Council, for one example, do nothing to
              contradict this analysis. Eamonn&nbsp;ONeill, the Member for South
              Down, in his capacity as a member of Down District Council
              successfully proposed the banning of the Union flag from Down
              council’s buildings. In so doing he caused consternation amongst
              the people of that area, and consequently, members of the Unionist
              population there are considering their future in respect of the
              council.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is the flag of the United Kingdom of Great
              Britain and Northern Ireland and represents the authority and the
              sovereignty of the Westminster Parliament. This flag, through the
              rights which flow from it, gives each and every individual and
              every local minority and majority the right to fully express their
              particular cultural and religious identities, as long as they do
              not impinge on other civil or religious liberties. To remove this
              flag is not just an unprecedented insult to every Unionist citizen
              in the district, but it also represents a two-fingered salute to
              the sovereign Government which gave this institution its power.
              One of our SDLP Members served in the UDR. He had no problem with
              that; he served for a number of years. He is not here at the
              moment, perhaps he is having his lunch. He was able to serve under
              the Union flag, and that was no bother to him. Unfortunately for
              Unionism the pan-Nationalist front has gained a new Member in the
              last few weeks in the form of the Ulster Unionist Party — in the
              form of the leadership — represented in this House by a group of
              individuals too concerned about paying off the new car, or paying
              for the holiday to worry about the fact that they are selling this
              country out from under their own clumsy feet.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Their 1998 Assembly manifesto contained the
              question &quot;Will a ‘Yes’ vote undermine our flag and
              culture?&quot; and gave the answer as &quot;No.&quot; This is
              another example of a manifesto commitment cast aside by those new
              agents of pan-Nationalism, the leaders of the Ulster Unionist
              Party. We had a taste of having armed terrorists in Government
              between November 1999 and February 2000, and witnessed their
              intention to undermine the integrity of the Union flag.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When he came back from Taiwan, John Taylor told
              us that he had assurances on the Union flag and on the RUC. What
              we have seen is the very opposite. People could be forgiven for
              thinking that Mr Taylor had an example of Montezuma’s revenge,
              as we saw at the Waterfront Hall.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Weir:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The leader of the main party opposite often
              tells us that one cannot eat a flag. That is a truism, but it is
              also an attempt to portray his party as post-Nationalist — one
              which has left Nationalism behind and embraces Europeanism. This
              is a very strange situation. For the first time in the two-year
              life of this Assembly, the SDLP has signed a Petition of Concern.
              Today we see the SDLP in its true green colours, a party with
              Nationalism at its heart.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The flags issue is crucial for Northern
              Ireland, and not simply because of the offence caused to many
              people by the failure of Sinn Féin Ministers to fly the flag,
              particularly in my constituency of North Down. One of the
              buildings affected has been the Department of Education
              headquarters at Rathgael House. Many of my constituents have been
              deeply offended by the actions of the Minister, Martin McGuinness.
              Flag-flying goes to the heart of such key issues as the
              acceptability of Sinn Féin in Government; the degree to which
              Nationalism has accepted the principle of consent; the degree to
              which our Britishness is being respected; and the degree to which
              the Executive works as a cohesive unit.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the first of those issues, Sinn Féin must
              pass a number of tests if it is to be acceptable as part of the
              Government of Northern Ireland. It must show that it is committed
              to peaceful means: it has clearly failed to do that so far. It
              must show that it is committed to the rule of law: again, it has
              clearly failed to do that. Indeed, it has indicated that even in a
              post-Patten situation young Nationalists should not consider
              joining the police.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, the flags issue shows that Sinn Féin
              fails on the crucial issue of consent. We must be wary of this
              issue. Everyone is entitled to have aspirations. We all have
              aspirations. I aspire to play centre forward for Northern Ireland
              at Windsor Park. That is not going to happen. One of the Members
              opposite aspires to be Lord Mayor of Belfast, and to one day have
              the opportunity to drive a car that has not been provided for the
              disabled. There is nothing wrong with having aspirations, but I
              take grave exception to the placing of the aspiration for a united
              Ireland on a par with my British citizenship. That is
              unacceptable. It strikes at the heart of the consent principle.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We were told at the time of the referendum that
              the consent principle had been fully accepted by Nationalists.
              Then again, we were told many things at the referendum that have
              not come to pass. Mr Maginness’s speech showed that Nationalist
              acceptance of the principle of consent is, at best, extremely
              limited. It is like being put on a boat and told that you are able
              to step off the boat, but only at the last step before you go over
              the waterfall. That is the attitude of Nationalists. Their
              acceptance of consent is only at the very final question. Anything
              that highlights the principle of consent, be it the name of the
              Royal Ulster Constabulary or the flying of flags, is clearly not
              accepted.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, this process has had the effect of
              diminishing our Britishness. We have seen the change of the RUC
              name.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have seen the changes in the Criminal
              Justice Review, and now we are seeing the flag coming down. It is
              what a Colleague of mine calls &quot;dimmer switch Britishness&quot;.
              Gradually the lights are going out throughout Northern Ireland on
              our British status.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, this issue shows that the Executive is
              not operating as an Executive. There has not been one coherent
              policy, but rather a series of fiefdoms where individual Ministers
              take their own decisions without any collective will. Some people
              tell us that this matter has been resolved to their satisfaction,
              because it has been placed in the hands of the Secretary of State.
              This is a Secretary of State whose record on the flag in relation
              to the Patten report was totally unacceptable. I have no great
              confidence in the Secretary of State, but today the Assembly has
              the opportunity to give voice to our views. Despite the
              constraints put on this motion by the petition of concern from the
              SDLP, Sinn Féin, Alliance and the Women’s Coalition, Members
              should send a clear signal that they are committed to the
              principle of consent by supporting the motion and supporting the
              flying of the Union flag over Government buildings.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I want to deal with some of the points
              raised about the approaches of different Ministers and parties to
              this matter. I re-emphasise Alban Maginness’ point that none of
              the SDLP Ministers directed that the flag was not to be flown on
              any of the designated days. That was not because we chose to have
              the flag flying, or wished the flag to be flown, but because we
              recognise that we have agreed in the Good Friday Agreement to deal
              with this sensitively. We are going to try to come to some
              agreement, some workable accommodation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Which building comes under the control of which
              Minister is a matter of chance. It so happens that my ministerial
              office is in Rathgael House, Bangor. However, it is not on the
              premises of the Department of Finance and Personnel, but the
              premises of the Minister of Education. On Friday, the flag did not
              fly over the building in which my office is located. However, the
              result of such a directive is that the area surrounding Rathgael
              House has become a veritable theme park of all sorts of flags —
              not just the Union flag, but the flags of various Loyalist
              paramilitaries. I cannot see how that solves the problem. I cannot
              understand how people can be so concerned and vexed about one flag
              flying over a building, and then take great delight and amusement
              when the building and its approach roads are surrounded by much
              more offensive flags. Flags carrying the emblems of paramilitaries
              are sinister. They are not flags to which anyone could profess the
              respect and esteem that I recognise that Colleagues opposite do to
              the Union flag.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is what stunt politics generates. Putting
              flags up all over the place and pulling flags down all over the
              place is stunt politics. We are not going to get into that,
              whatever the political pressures that might be upon us.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Government Departments are not the private
              property of the parties to which the Ministers belong. That also
              applies to parties talking about rotating Ministers and
              Departments. We hear about DUP Departments and Sinn Féin
              Departments. Departments should not be identified according to the
              party political allegiance of their Ministers. That is completely
              wrong. It is unfair to the people who work in those Departments
              and to the people relating to those Departments and depending on
              their services. That is why we are behaving with sensitivity.</p>

              ask those who say that we should have ordered the flags down what
              the result would have been? It would have compounded an already
              difficult situation. Feelings are running high, and people are
              very sensitive about this issue. For us to have jumped on that
              bandwagon would have only compounded the difficulties. It would
              not have helped to solve the problem. It would have ensured that
              we go even more rapidly to the invocation of the directive powers
              that the Secretary of State has in reserve.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is something which we have said we are
              opposed to. We are not going to engage in a cheap stunt by saying
              we are opposed to the Secretary of State’s powers, but are going
              to commit ourselves to a gimmick that actually means that those
              powers are more likely to be invoked and prevent us from any
              chance of actually dealing with and addressing this particular
              problem together.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are trying to show sensitivity on this. That
              is why I particularly resent the suggestions and the insinuations
              that a pan-Nationalist front is afoot, and that we are trying to
              strip people of their Britishness.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unionists want to feel that they have a place
              of respite under this Agreement. They want to know that the
              Agreement, as the package that they believe it is, and as the
              process about which Nationalists talk, is not an ever-growing
              Nationalist process and an ever- diminishing Unionist package.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is a serious political issue, which we all
              have to address responsibly. It is going to take time for us to
              learn to respect each other and adjust. That is why we have done
              nothing prematurely.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Equally, it would have been unforgivable for us
              to allow this particular motion— which is not about sensitivity
              — to pass. It is about flying the flags on even more days than
              have already been the cause of controversy. That would hardly be
              sensitive, and we could not afford to have such a motion passed by
              this House — and which would have the standing of this House —
              possibly being abused in the future by the Secretary of State when
              it comes to his directive powers. We had no choice but to put
              forward the petition of concern.</p>

              and sit in the corner and take their salaries at the end of the

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The flags issue has divided the community in
              Northern Ireland for a long time, and it is going to continue to
              divide us. I am grateful to the SDLP for the way in which it has
              shown sensitivity in the Departments it controls. That is a
              sensible way forward and it respects the sensitive nature of this
              issue in both communities. It shows that the SDLP is willing, on
              this occasion, to actually try and listen to, and to understand
              and deal sensibly with, issues that are different between the

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thank you, Mr Speaker. The flying of the Union
              flag is not the display of a cultural symbol for me. The Union
              flag does not represent my British culture. It represents the
              symbol of the state in which I reside. If, by Act of Parliament,
              the flag were changed tomorrow, then I would give my allegiance to
              the new flag that was created. It just so happens that the flag
              that is in existence is the one that was created following the Act
              of Union in 1801.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the United Kingdom, the Queen and Parliament
              decided to make a change to that flag, then that would be the new
              flag of the nation in which I reside. All that I would ask is for
              respect to be given to the flying of the flag that reflects the
              nation in which we reside. That is what is contained in the
              agreement. The principle of consent means that we respect the flag
              of the nation we reside in. We respect the fact that Northern
              Ireland remains part of the United Kingdom. That is the compromise
              that has been given.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a compromise on both sides here —
              Unionists have compromised in accepting that, in the eventuality
              of the majority of people in Northern&nbsp;Ireland agreeing that
              their future was best in a United&nbsp;Ireland, the constitutional
              status of Northern&nbsp;Ireland would change. I would not choose
              to reside in that state — I simply would not wish to. However,
              we have compromised on that. We are prepared to accept that, even
              though it is against our will. As a minority we would accept the
              decision of the majority. We are asking, when the reverse of that
              is the case, that Nationalists accept that the majority of people
              in Northern&nbsp;Ireland wish to reside in the
              United&nbsp;Kingdom. In view of this, the symbols of the state of
              the United&nbsp;Kingdom should be the ones which are seen in and
              on public buildings in Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I spoke yesterday with my partner who has just
              come back from England. She was struck by the fact that when she
              was driving through England there were far fewer flags displayed.
              What she also found interesting was that all the Union flags on
              display in England were in good order and properly maintained.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am very pleased that Nigel&nbsp;Dodds, the
              Member for North Belfast, for once actually wants to listen to
              what I have to say. The point I was trying to make was that in
              discussions yesterday with my partner, who has just recently
              returned from England — and before anybody in the Front Bench of
              the DUP gets the host up, my female partner — pointed out to me
              that in her travels she saw a number of Union flags, although
              nowhere near the number one sees in Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Every last one of them was well maintained and
              flown the right way up. She returned to Northern Ireland and saw
              raggedy flag after raggedy flag tied to lamp-posts in Dundonald.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this community we have used and abused the
              Union flag for many years. Rather than showing it the proper
              respect it deserves as a symbol of our nation, we have used it as
              a battering ram and as an attempted cultural symbol for one
              community to do down the other with. That is why Nationalists find
              it difficult to accept the Union flag as the flag of our nation.
              How is that going to be improved by flying yet more flags from
              lamp-posts around Rathgael House?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the Minister of Education will, in
              due course, listen to the concerns of Unionists and respect what
              he signed up and agreed to in the agreement. The principle of
              consent means that Northern&nbsp;Ireland remains part of the
              United Kingdom, and therefore the flag of the United Kingdom, as
              chosen by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, should be the one
              that flies on public buildings.</p>

              to speak on this debate. Some of those who had the chance to speak
              felt rather frustrated that they were allowed only five minutes.
              Others, who got no chance, will have been even more frustrated,
              but the Business Committee decided that the time available was to
              be two hours, and we have come to the end of that period. I call
              on Dr&nbsp;Paisley to make the winding-up speech, and we will then
              move immediately to the vote before suspending for lunch.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This debate was brought about not by the DUP
              but by the attitude of two Ministers who used their powers to see
              to it that the flag of our nation was not flown on two days when
              it should have been. They did not ask the Assembly if that action
              had universal or even majority support. They did something that
              was a purely political act to try and satisfy their followers that
              they were making headway on the Republican agenda that they have
              embraced.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I notice that every time a Unionist spokesman
              talks about the pan-Nationalist front, the SDLP gets very excited.
              There are people other than the SDLP and the IRA/Sinn&nbsp;Féin
              in the pan-Nationalist front, and the Ulster people have
              recognised that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They can abuse me as much as they like. I will
              not suffer. I will go to Westminster today and cast my vote
              against the Police Bill. I will sleep well tonight and be back in
              the morning to do the task that I have to do, but they should
              realise that I am not speaking for myself. I am speaking for the
              ordinary, individual Ulsterman who wants to remain in the United
              Kingdom. No one in the House can deny me that right because on
              five occasions the people of this Province have had the
              opportunity to say yes or no, and they said yes.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even at the last election, when every weapon
              was used, finances flowed, and newspapers would not take a
              statement from me, they did not succeed. When you abuse me, you
              abuse the majority of Ulster’s men and women who have the same
              convictions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sticks and stones may break my bones. The
              Republicans have fired on me, beaten up my wife when she was a
              member of Belfast City Council — stoned her — and attempted to
              murder my son by loosening the wheels on his car. He was clever
              enough to catch it on. The police said that if he had driven the
              car, he probably would have been killed. We have all been under
              that sort of threat, but it will not stop us. Get rid of
              Ian&nbsp;Paisley, and there will be somebody else speaking the
              same language and saying the same thing because this represents a
              large number of people.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am highly insulted by what Mr Durkan has
              said. I never thought he would say that Unionists were looking for
              some place of respite. We are not on the run. He may think we are,
              but we are not. We are not looking for respite care. We can take
              care of ourselves. The leading spokesman and Finance Minister of
              Northern Ireland says that the people of Northern Ireland who do
              not agree with what is going on, are looking for some place of
              respite. We are doing nothing of the sort. I want to tell Mr
              Durkan that we are going to keep the flag flying. We are not going
              to bend the knee to IRA/Sinn Féin, or any member of the
              pan-Nationalist front.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members mentioned backgrounds and where
              people came from. I have no apology to make for my background. It
              is a pity that the lady, who is not present — oh, I see she is
              present although she is taking a back seat — Mrs&nbsp;Nelis, did
              not tell us about her history, about the gypsy she was when she
              left the SDLP. She did not tell us that her husband was a member
              of the UDR. We might as well have the full information. When her
              husband came home did she pick off the harp and the crown and say
              &quot;You do not need to wear that. That offends me.&quot;? I do
              not know whether she said that. The Minister herself was quick to

              have been at this game a long time.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have the Minister who signed the decree to
              keep the flag off Mr&nbsp;Durkan’s building, so he could not fly
              the flag, nor could the Secretary of State, according to the
              press. She cannot be proud of her family tree now, as a
              Republican, because they were all eminent in the British Army. It
              is interesting that these things have arisen and that all the
              blame is put upon the poor Ulster Unionists.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Dallat has quite a record about flags.
              It was very interesting that he mentioned two murders and forgot
              about all the IRA murders. He forgot about the tortures and the
              mutilation that were carried out on the bodies of the dead. I do
              not want to mention those in this House; they are so gruesome. He
              need not sit and smile. Only two Roman Catholic killings were the
              result of Protestants or Unionists. Let us get this right. This is
              a serious matter because it strikes at the sovereignty of our
              country.</p>

              Assembly or for the Secretary of State or for Her Majesty’s
              Government? It is a matter for those people who enforce the flying
              of the flag in line with the command of Her Majesty the Queen and,
              if all else fails, we should petition Her Majesty the Queen to
              ensure that her writ runs in Northern Ireland.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Assembly has the power to put the flags up
              on this Building. The Secretary of State has not taken that power.
              That power has not been devolved. Let no Unionist tell his people
              that the Secretary of State is responsible. The Secretary of State
              is not responsible for that. This Assembly is. That is why this
              motion is relevant to this Assembly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What has been illustrated in the House today is
              the fact that this Assembly is not in charge of its own decisions
              because the pan-Nationalist front can bring forward its petition
              of concern. It has been argued by the Official Unionists that this
              is a breach of the right of self-determination — I already
              mentioned that in my opening speech — and that is right. But the
              right of self-determination must be the right of the majority of
              the population to exercise that self-determination. However, these
              people veto our right to do that so that we do not have that
              right. When we read the IRA statement of recent days we notice
              that it rejected the right of self-determination altogether and
              said self-determination would have to be eliminated before it
              would hand over its weapons.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I regret that Members of this House suggest, by
              the things that they say, that there is a conspiracy on these
              Benches to keep this man from speaking. If there was any such
              conspiracy I would have thought that you would have caught on to
              that long ago. But this is an act to denigrate this Assembly. One
              of the Members, Mr Nesbitt, said that we were only a little
              Assembly. I say to the Member that littleness is great. It may not
              be great in his eyes, but he could call with my optician and might
              get another pair of spectacles that would help him to appreciate
              it. This little Assembly can be great. I have no apology to make
              for the smallness of the territory of Northern Ireland. I am proud
              of Northern Ireland and I am proud of its people. The people of
              Northern Ireland are people that need to be encouraged after all
              they have been through.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Farren came out in his true colours when he
              told us what he thought in his heart. When sitting at a table in
              another part of this Building I thought about the time when Mr
              Mallon told us what he thought of Carson’s monument. He said his
              flesh crept as he passed it every day. He is going to have
              terrible trouble with his flesh because he is passing it every day
              now — he will soon have creeping paralysis if he keeps going
              past that monument. The next thing will be that they will want to
              remove Carson’s monument and go back to what the civil righters
              could not do. They tried to shift the monument of Lord Craigavon
              — and if you climb the steps you can see the marks on the marble
              — but old Lord Craigavon’s bust shouted out &quot;not an
              inch&quot; and they could not get him down the steps.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These matters today are part of a programme —
              and they are all at one on those benches, and there are some
              people helping them on — the aim of which is that &quot;we will
              get you&quot; at the end.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I said in my opening remarks, they did not
              have any trouble whatsoever with the minority in the Irish
              Republic — talk about toleration; the Orangemen could not even
              march in Dublin because they eliminated them, and that is why we
              have a population of only 2·5% Protestants now in the South of
              Ireland. In the South of Ireland there is not even a spokesman for
              the basic element of Protestantism or Britishness. That is because
              they are cowed into subjection.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then we are told that we have to take them when
              they come here. When Mary McAleese comes up, the RUC are not good
              enough to protect her and their cars are not good enough for her
              to ride in. Yet she wants to be received and to sit in the Queen’s
              chair at the General Assembly; she did not want any lesser chair
              than that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I say to the pan-Nationalists that the people
              of Northern Ireland will not lie down or go away. They might think
              that the people who are opposed to the agreement are all going to
              disappear some day. The IRA might shoot some of us and kill us,
              but that will not settle the matter.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are people who are dedicated as long as
              they have the majority and, of course, Mr&nbsp;Kelly has not got
              50%. To say that the Nationalists make up 50% is nonsense. I want
              to tell Mr&nbsp;Kelly that Protestants breed as well.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are facing an issue that will not go away. I
              regret that the Executive, instead of facing this, handed it away.
              They thought they would get it easy, but that is not the case. It
              is the right of the people in this House to fly the flag on the
              Building. When we vote today, we are voting for something that we
              have a right to do. As for the petition of concern, there will
              always be a petition of concern when there is any matter that is
              not going to help forward the pan-Nationalist front and its
              Republican agenda.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not have time to deal with some of the
              matters that were raised in the debate. Mr&nbsp;McGuinness was
              trying to tell us of the wonderful spirit of unity that was in his
              heart, a wonderful spirit for his Official Unionist friends. I
              have never heard such hypocrisy in all my life. He was trying to
              tell us that, at this time, they were not prepared to fly the
              flag, but that that did not mean that for all time we would not
              have the Union flag flying from our buildings.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I had

              to Tellers, so that they would be aware of how they should behave
              when acting as Tellers. This arose as I was in an unfortunate

              issued, however, I will be consulting with the Business Committee
              and, in all probability, with the Procedures Committee. Having

              conduct is not necessarily a matter of being ungentlemanly or
              unladylike. It may sometimes be a matter of just being in the

              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That this Assembly notes with approval the work
              to be completed by 30 June 2000 by public bodies in order to
              comply with the requirements of Section 75 of the Northern Ireland
              Act 1998.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This motion has been put on the clár to afford
              the Assembly an opportunity to comment on, and set down markers in
              relation to, conformity with equality requirements by public
              bodies and other bodies in receipt of public funds. This is the
              month in which those bodies designated by the Secretary of State
              are to complete their equality schemes. It is an opportune time
              for us, as elected representatives, to note with approval the
              genuine efforts being made by some to conform fully with the
              requirements of section&nbsp;75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998
              and to remind those who have produced inadequate responses that we
              are determined to hold them fully to those requirements. We must
              also ask why the Secretary of State appears to have exempted
              certain public bodies, and many bodies in receipt of public funds,
              from the requirements of the Act.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The inclusion of an equality agenda in the
              negotiations that led to the Good Friday Agreement was no
              accident. The unfortunate attitude of many public and private
              bodies in this state throughout its history was, perhaps, best
              summed up by John Taylor at the beginning of those negotiations,
              when he said</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Of course there can be equality of
              opportunity, but not equality. The Irish minority cannot be equal
              to the majority in Northern Ireland.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The incorporation of the equality agenda into
              the agreement was a direct consequence of resistance to the
              systematic discrimination that was prosecuted by the institutions
              of this state, including public bodies, for three generations.
              Until that apparatus of discrimination is dismantled, the emphasis
              on equality must be a major focus in the Programme for Government
              of this Administration. The Good Friday Agreement enshrined the
              equality agenda and paved the way for the creation of a new
              statutory duty under section&nbsp;75 of the Northern Ireland Act
              to promote equality among all public bodies. This requires such
              bodies to have due regard to the need to promote equality of
              opportunity, and that means more than just facilitating equality
              of opportunity. It means recognising the existing need to redress
              inequalities and actively promoting policies that address that
              need. These will inevitably include affirmative action measures,
              which will need to be clearly identified in equality schemes.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is not just about religious and political
              discrimination, which has been the hallmark of this state,
              important though that is. Equality schemes must actively address
              disability issues. The experience of inequality among disabled
              people in this society is evidenced by the fact that nearly one in
              five persons of working age in the Six Counties has a disability
              which significantly limits their day-to-day activities. Only 31%
              of people with disabilities are in employment, compared to 75% of
              those without.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On gender issues, the discrimination
              experienced by women in all aspects of the economy of the Six
              Counties remains an obstacle to social change and economic
              equality. Just over half — 50·5% — of women are economically
              active, compared to 69·4% of men. Female workers are concentrated
              in low-paid, low-status jobs and in part-time, casual or temporary
              work with poor terms and conditions. Overall, women’s income
              from employment and/or benefits is only 61% of that of men.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the issue of race, there is continuing
              racism on institutional and individual levels. The marginalisation
              of Irish travellers is reflected in their lower life expectancy,
              higher infant mortality and poorer educational attainment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Attacks on, and harassment of, ethnic
              minorities are increasingly common in Irish society, both North
              and South. There are other issues relating to sexual orientation,
              age, religious belief, political opinion, and those with and
              without dependants.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the unemployment differential, the most
              recent labour force survey, released a fortnight ago, demonstrated
              that Catholics are still more than twice as likely to be
              unemployed as Protestants. This has been the case throughout the
              last three decades, despite the repeated bogus claims about the
              efficiency of fair employment legislation in this society. The
              1991 census showed that Catholic males in my constituency of Newry
              and Armagh were as much as three times more likely to be
              unemployed than Protestant males. In the Mid Ulster constituency,
              Catholic males were almost three times more likely to be
              unemployed than Protestant males, and Catholic females twice as
              likely as Protestant females to be unemployed. Undoubtedly this is
              as much a product of the practice of discrimination in job
              location as the practice of discrimination in job appointments. In
              an article published last year in the ‘European Journal of
              Political Economy’, Prof&nbsp;Vani Borooah concluded that the
              central message, based on analysis of the 1991 census for Northern
              Ireland, was that there was clear evidence of discrimination
              against Catholics.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This systemic discrimination has been
              institutionalised in the Northern Ireland Civil Service. The
              latest equal opportunities audit, published earlier this year,
              shows gross under-representation of women and Catholics in the
              senior grades of the Civil Service. Indeed, it was not long ago
              that we had the spectacle of a Catholic woman being subjected to
              the worst kind of sectarian harassment in the office of
              Baroness&nbsp;Denton. Despite the shame and adverse publicity that
              that case brought upon the senior Civil Service grades, the
              perpetrator of that sectarian abuse was subsequently promoted.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Targets must be set, as part of the Programme
              of Government for this Administration, to eliminate the
              unemployment differential and to ensure equality of representation
              for Nationalists and women in the senior Civil Service grades.
              Many of the equality schemes produced to date, particularly and
              disappointingly those by many of the Government Departments, fall
              below acceptable standards. They are deficient in affirmative
              action measures, transparency monitoring and research, proper use
              of impact assessments, and effective timetables to tackle
              seriously the impact of inequality in this state. Some public
              bodies have not even been required by the Secretary of State to
              comply with the equality requirements. That is contrary to the
              intent of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly should send out a signal that less
              than full and proactive adherence to the principles of equality
              will not be tolerated from anyone in receipt of public funding.
              The private sector should also take note of our determination in
              this regard. We should note with approval the work being
              undertaken on this issue, but should also serve notice that
              adherence to equality principles will be a central theme of these
              institutions. We will remain vigilant until full equality across
              all these issues has been attained. Go raibh maith agat.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am somewhat unclear about the meaning and
              intention of the motion. I am assuming that Members will be noting
              with approval the intended, or hoped for, result of the work
              currently being undertaken, and which has been completed by some
              public bodies and authorities. Rather than necessarily agreeing
              with Conor Murphy’s introductory remarks that many bodies have
              successfully completed the work, I would like to concentrate on
              his remarks questioning the levels of completion and adherence to
              the requirements by slightly amending them to &quot;some bodies
              have successfully completed.&quot; In our view, an analysis of the
              existing draft equality schemes shows that they leave a lot to be
              desired, and they appear to have fallen well short of the intended
              aim.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I and my Colleagues, having examined draft
              reports from various public bodies, are particularly concerned
              that such bodies appear to be paying only lip-service to the
              scheme requirements. Many lack the appropriate levels of detail in
              their assessment plans. In particular, I draw the Member’s
              attention to the Departments that are attached to the Assembly.
              There is, in the SDLP’s view, a big flaw in many of the
              assessment plans. They appear to be statements of agreement with
              the spirit of the legislation, rather than of what arrangements
              are needed in order to carry out an equality impact assessment of
              their policies.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recent European Commission research into
              equality legislation showed that the quality of the policy
              statement and the assumed equality-neutral character of the policy
              were two difficulties in promoting what it referred to as
              mainstreaming, that is, implementing quality legislation in the
              workplace. Our departmental equality schemes tend to fail on both
              counts, as they provide no information to support implicit
              assumptions or explicit statements of assumptions made.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There does not appear to be any joined-up
              government discussion of how one Department’s policy might
              influence another. In the SDLP’s view, Departments should
              provide much more detail on decisions relating to their timetable
              of work.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The documents appear — I am talking about the
              whole public body requirement — generally to support the
              requirements of the scheme. But, as I have said already, they do
              not go far enough in suggesting what is needed within the
              organisations to carry out an equality impact assessment on
              policy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Often it is a simple matter of repeating the
              guidelines and agreeing with their implementation, rather than
              proactively illustrating how they can work. The true test is the
              commitment of finance and resources to achieve equality. It is a
              good test of a public body’s commitment to see whether it will
              &quot;pony up&quot;, as we might say, and make a financial
              commitment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I am trying to illustrate, there is a mixed
              picture surrounding the draft schemes and their various aspects.
              For example, how far does the draft scheme issued by any body
              specify that adequate consideration will be given to impact
              assessments? I am now talking generally and not just about the
              Departments, which I have dealt with specifically. Too often one
              sees repetition of old Policy Appraisal and Fair Treatment-style
              formulae that are more about redressing discrimination than about
              actively promoting equality. Many of the schemes do not supply
              visible impact analysis plans. There are several other concerns,
              but my time is up.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Madam Deputy Speaker, it is good to see you
              back in the Chair. This is an interesting debate, and it is
              interesting to see who has brought the equality issue forward.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall touch a little on the equality schemes
              in the first instance. I have to concur with some of Mr ONeill’s
              remarks. Many of the responses have lacked clarity, particularly
              in relation to staff training, resourcing, timetabling and impact
              assessment. There is also a lack of information on the financial
              implications of the measures proposed, and in many cases there is
              no indication of how they propose to communicate the schemes to
              young people. Many of the schemes do not address the needs of
              older people.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is much work to be done on a lot of the
              schemes that have been brought forward on the draft proposals.
              There is a need for tightening up. The policy of the DUP on
              equality is that no one should suffer discrimination on account of
              gender, disability, religion, ethnicity or creed.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We believe that everyone is entitled to be in
              the same position in respect of getting jobs or of accessing the
              various options that are available to them and that no one should
              be discriminated against. I am thinking in particular of the new
              police force that is to be established and the fact that the
              selection of police officers is to be carried out on a fifty-fifty
              basis. In reality, there should be a system whereby those who are
              best qualified should be selected to carry out the job.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was told today that Sinn Féin had been
              speaking to foreign journalists and telling them that people who
              had previously been engaged in paramilitarism should be entitled
              to join the RUC. In my view that is not equal representation. All
              those who adhere to the law and who are prepared to enforce it in
              an impartial manner should be entitled to apply to join the RUC,
              or the Northern Ireland Police Service, or whatever it happens to
              be called. Nothing else should be taken into account.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would be interested to see how European money
              will be distributed under these new equality schemes. In the past
              there was a very unequal distribution of European money. We heard
              some interesting figures being quoted today — figures that go
              back to 1991. That is the last century, in case those people did
              not realise. It is time to come into the new century, into the new
              era, into the new millennium and leave the old century behind. On
              a regular basis, we hear old, irrelevant figures being quoted, but
              perhaps a lot of people in South Armagh, those referred to, were
              &quot;doing the double&quot; at that time. That was before the
              Tories had drawn up the legislation which stamped out a lot of
              that, and perhaps not as many people were unemployed as the
              statistics created by that census showed. That census has
              undoubtedly been used to discriminate against members of my
              community when it came to getting money from the European peace
              funds, and that should be addressed under the new equality
              initiative. Ministers of this Government have made certain
              appointments. How does that fit in with the equality agenda? The
              Health Department, for example, has brought out its equality
              agenda, and yet the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public
              Safety has taken on a multiple murderer to act as her special
              adviser. Was that person the best qualified to do the job, or was
              it simply a case of employing somebody because of his past? <i>[Interruption]</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are currently a number of problems with
              these schemes, and from what I understand, 105 of them have been
              completed to date. I want to pay tribute at this point to a number
              of bodies that have called for consultation with others, in
              particular the South Eastern Education and Library Board, which
              wrote to Assembly Members yesterday. The letter gave details of
              meetings at which the Board is prepared to have consultation
              before it finally submits its schemes. This is a piece of good
              practice which the other designated bodies would have done well to
              follow, rather than simply preparing a scheme and forwarding it to
              each of us. We currently have approximately 50 of these schemes
              sitting on our desks, and they could have notified us about some
              of these consultation meetings.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That brings me to my first point. This is such
              a new method of designing equality in Northern&nbsp;Ireland that a
              great deal more consultation should have taken place. There are
              three stages. The Equality Commission made it very clear to the
              designated bodies that they could have taken more time in the
              preparation for approval of the schemes, and then decided on what
              should be screened for impact assessment statements.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having read a number of them, I am concerned
              that the departmental bodies — not the non-departmental ones —
              have decided what they are screening out. So, it seems they have
              taken a very negative approach to the issue of equality. In other
              words, they are deciding what they are not going to do, rather
              than what they are going to do.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, there would have been a third stage,
              after the schemes had been forwarded to the Equality Commission,
              when there could have been some consultation on the impact
              assessment statements. I am slightly disappointed that they did
              not take the opportunity to engage in the kind of wide-ranging
              consultation that needs to happen on issues of equality, and in
              which the Human Rights Commission is now prepared to engage, in
              relation to its bill of rights.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a unique opportunity for
              Northern&nbsp;Ireland. Human rights and equality should not be
              owned by any section of the House — they belong to us all. With
              that in mind, I commend Mr&nbsp;Poots for his early comments,
              before he got into the disappointing party political statements.
              He was right in saying that Departments have lost an opportunity
              to speak to children in particular about the impact, and also to
              older people who have often been the more excluded and
              marginalised members of our community.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most of the schemes comment on disability,
              religion, race and gender. However, this was an opportunity for us
              to bring in others, and link up Departments which are responsible
              for older people and the younger members of our community.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is serious concern that the Secretary of
              State has still not designated other bodies for equality schemes.
              Different types of bodies have been designated, and those
              currently completing the schemes have been designated under two
              pieces of legislation — the Commissioner for Complaints
              (Northern Ireland) Order 1996 and the Ombudsman (Northern Ireland)
              Order 1996. The Secretary of State has the power to designate
              other bodies and has not done so. He should now set out a
              timetable by which he will designate them and let us see how
              comprehensive these bodies are.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now that our new Ministers are in place, they
              should be committed to the schemes. In their absence, the
              Departments and the designated bodies had to go ahead and prepare
              the schemes. The Ministers may not have had much time to sign off
              the schemes, other than perhaps by adding their signatures. Now is
              the time for them, in this consultation process, to be active
              change agents. If the statements do not come from the top and
              there is not a commitment to allocate resources — as Mr&nbsp;Poots
              has pointed out — and put the training in place, they will only
              be as good as words on paper. Many of us know that writing reports
              or making statements is worth little if they are not enforced or
              implemented.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I take some hope from the fact that we have now
              gone a long way in Northern&nbsp;Ireland towards not just talking
              about and using the rhetoric of equality, but to producing action.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Lewsley:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr&nbsp;Conor&nbsp;Murphy for proposing
              the motion on equality, as it gives the House an early opportunity
              to examine the issue of equality schemes currently out for
              consultation across Government Departments.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The equality schemes set up under section 75 of
              the Northern Ireland Act 1998 are a worthwhile first step.
              However, I know, from my own experience in responding to the
              Department of Education’s scheme, that the consultation period
              is very short. If equality is to work for any group of people then
              the key to success is enforcement and accountability. I call on
              the Departments, and the Ministers in particular, to put equality
              high on their agenda. I call on them to ensure that
              section&nbsp;75 is implemented in full and that they address some
              of the issues raised today and I call on them to ensure that
              adequate resources are allocated, suitable training is given to
              staff and that appropriate mechanisms are put in place for proper
              consultation, particularly, complaint procedures.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Questions also need to be asked about whether
              the internal management structures for coping with the equality
              duty are adequate and about whether suitable weight is given to
              the equality of opportunity considerations when it comes to making
              final decisions. These queries need to be answered and appropriate
              amendments made to redress the major flaws in these schemes.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would also like to bring to the House’s
              attention the specific issue of equality for those with a
              disability under the requirements of section&nbsp;75 of the Act.
              The House will be aware that the Disability Discrimination Act of
              1995 is already on the statute book. However, for this law to have
              real teeth in the future, it is essential to establish a
              commission of enforcement for Northern Ireland. Without such
              enforcement it will not be possible to make serious inroads into
              the present levels of discrimination. In the rest of the UK the
              newly formed Disability Rights Commission has real teeth to deal
              with those who flout the law. In Great Britain, the commission
              possesses the powers not only to investigate cases of inequality
              in the workplace but, where necessary, to pursue action through
              the courts. As no such protection or redress exists for disabled
              people in Northern Ireland, I look forward to early legislation
              emanating from the Office of the First and Deputy First Ministers
              not only to correct this imbalance, but, more importantly, to
              protect disabled people against discrimination in our society.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a result of the House’s recent suspension,
              the powers contained in the Equality (Disability, etc)
              (Commencement No 1) Order (Northern Ireland) 2000 were left for
              others to decide. As a result, disabled people in Northern Ireland
              got a raw deal and did not receive the protection they rightly
              deserve. The House has the duty in the months and years ahead to
              ensure such protection. Then and only then will we be able to talk
              seriously about equality.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In recent years there has been a more pragmatic
              and forward-looking approach to various aspects of equality
              legislation, particularly when it refers to disability and gender.
              May I echo the comments made by Mr&nbsp;Poots that noone in the
              House would contemplate or countenance accepting or acquiescing to
              discrimination on the grounds of ethnicity, religion, community
              background or anything else. We believe in the concept of a fair
              and equal society.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now, looking at the timetable for equality
              impact assessments, it is very clear, taking the equality agenda
              as a whole, that what is happening in Northern Ireland is the
              emerging of a concept of inequality. A revision of legislation is
              being undertaken as result of this concept rather than as a result
              of reality. That concept is total and utter nonsense. It is a
              fallacy that people are discriminated against in Northern Ireland
              because they are Roman Catholic. People may say that for party
              political purposes or because they need some medical or
              psychiatric assistance. Perhaps they should listen and learn.</p>

              think one of its representatives spoke earlier — 76·8% of
              recruits last year were Roman Catholic. In the case of Down
              District Council — again, one of its representatives spoke
              earlier — 78·9% of recruits last year were Roman Catholic. In
              Londonderry — a representative has not spoken until now —
              77·4% of recruits were Roman Catholic. In the case of Omagh
              District Council, 73·8% of recruits were Roman Catholic. Strabane
              came out remarkably well: only 60% were Roman Catholic. What sort

              of Norbrook Laboratories, the head of which sits on one of the
              North/South Councils, 85·9% of recruits are Roman Catholics. The
              figure for Glen Electric is 95·1% — we are coming close to
              100%. Sean Quinn’s is 91·2% Roman Catholic. Reality checks are
              needed big time. People want to try to dwell on a concept and an
              illusion of reality. In reality, our community is being
              discriminated against day in, day out.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any equality impact assessment study must take
              account of the impact that reverse discrimination has had over the
              past 20&nbsp;years. There is nothing that I have seen or heard
              from either the Equality Commission or any submissions to it that
              takes account of that — nothing. It has to be and it must be
              taken account of because these figures demonstrate a worsening
              position. If I were to read out the figures of 10&nbsp;years ago
              they would have been slightly better than that. Where there are
              large numbers of Roman Catholics in employment, even more are
              being recruited. Of course there is the reverse situation where
              there are a large number of Protestants being employed, but it is
              not the case that large numbers of Protestants are also being
              recruited.</p>

              into the Good Friday Agreement was a direct result of the
              inequalities that have existed in this state since partition. As
              my Colleague, Conor&nbsp;Murphy, pointed out, senior Unionist
              politicians in the Six Counties failed to recognise the
              inequalities that existed then, and some still fail to recognise
              them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 75 is a key part of the Northern
              Ireland Act 1998. Section 73 outlines the duties of the Equality
              Commission. The legislation also details the equality schemes that
              will help to address the imbalances in our society. It should
              provide a framework to help ensure that equality of opportunity
              for all is made a reality in policy making. By 30 June, public
              authorities will have to comply with the requirements of section
              75 by law. However, it is vital that all public authorities are
              included in this designation. At this point Peter&nbsp;Mandelson,
              who has authority for designating bodies in receipt of public
              funding, has not yet designated universities, further education
              colleges and UK Departments. I urge him to do so immediately.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The UK Departments include the Home Office,

              which clearly has an obligation to promote equality. Some other
              glaring omissions include the Department of Enterprise, Trade and
              Investment, which has is no equality scheme for the IDB — a body
              which has been criticised recently for its poor management and bad
              judgement, and which has a huge budget to spend as and, more
              importantly, where it wishes.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department for Social Development, in which
              there is no equality scheme for the Belfast Regeneration Office,
              has spent millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money on the

              most deprived areas of the city in terms of employment and
              accessibility. While the docks area thrives with building work
              going on as far as the eye can see, areas like north and west
              Belfast remain as they were, with dereliction and deprivation
              being the norm.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are in danger of creating greater divisions
              and disparity in this city, and across the Six Counties, unless
              funding is properly allocated so that all can benefit from the
              resources that are available. If the Belfast Regeneration Office
              does not have to comply with equality legislation, there will be a
              danger that Nationalist areas will suffer neglect. What I find
              hardest to understand is the reticence of the Office of the
              Centre, under the First and Deputy First Ministers, on addressing
              religious and political discrimination. They are listed in the
              screening process as matters for consideration in five years from
              now. The same scheme has listed community relations for impact
              appraisal in the first year of work.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The promotion of equality in employment, goods
              and services should be the primary duty and the promotion of good
              relations a secondary consideration. If the former is achieved, it
              should surely underpin the latter. As for the equality schemes
              themselves, it is essential to have clear and unambiguous
              timetables specified for achieving the tasks and goals. Equality
              schemes must include timetables for training, for screening and
              for the production of impact assessments and annual reports. They
              must clearly specify how the body concerned intends to secure
              equality and not merely repeat the guidelines. We have to ensure
              that overlaps that may exist are properly dealt with and do not
              result in gaps in the provision for equality. Schemes must
              indicate the extent of their responsibilities for impact
              assessment and show how this relates to the next level up or down
              to ensure adequate protection.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">None of the equality schemes that I have seen
              to date has addressed one of the most important aspects of this
              work — is the effective monitoring of employment practices by
              public authorities. We all know about disparities in employment
              practices which were only addressed in part by the old fair
              employment legislation. For example, senior ranks of the Civil
              Service and Government Departments discriminated wholesale against
              Catholics.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sure we will get order.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Equality, as Mr&nbsp;Campbell has confirmed, is
              a term like reconciliation, agreement and even peace that has many
              definitions,depending on your background and perceptions. It is
              therefore difficult for us to ascertain how the statutory duty in
              section 75 will affect the need for equality of opportunity for
              all and how it will be implemented by designated public
              authorities in terms of good value, equal treatment, and best
              practice. This must be done within the specified criteria. I
              recommend a means used by the Northern Ireland Human Rights
              Commission. It has circulated to all other bodies, and to their
              staff, an Equality Commitment Statement. If any member of staff
              feels that he is being discriminated against in any way he can
              call that up to have it dealt with.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Something like that is clear. As other Members
              have said, sometimes it is great to put something on paper, but it
              can be hard to implement it. The submissions that I have read from
              many different public authorities and bodies make very similar
              reading. It looks as if they all used the same template, which
              seems to be this guide to the statutory duties. I got the definite
              impression that many, if not all, seem to have been completed
              simply because they were obligatory rather than from an informed
              viewpoint, and clearly that gives concern.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Equality Commission has worked tirelessly
              on advising and informing authorities on the implementation of the
              statutory duty, but it is early days for all of us. We will need
              to support the Equality Commission’s examination of policies for
              promoting equality of opportunity. This must be done within
              appendix 1 of the Act, which I do not have time to read out.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Equality-impact assessment must also be clearly
              and effectively conducted so that everyone feels they have been
              treated exactly the same. The consultation process, as others have
              mentioned, must be thorough and comprehensive; it does not seem to
              have been in some submissions I have seen in different areas which
              I know. There has not been as wide a consultation to complete
              their submission as there should have been. Members have already
              mentioned shortcomings regarding disability and gender, therefore,
              rather than follow my notes, I shall merely say that I share their
              concerns.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the main problems to date is the
              complete absence of information for the public, who seem unaware
              of the statutory duty’s implications. Procedures must be
              publicised for the public so that equality requirements can be
              properly maintained. As has been said, in due course equality
              schemes must be produced by other bodies and authorities that have
              not been designated, and I hope the Secretary of State will
              examine that. Organisationssuch as the Assembly must look at it to
              ensure that we lead the way in promoting equality at all levels.
              Our Departments have had to make submissions on issues like
              employment and recruitment practice, and procedures of general
              good practice and we must do likewise.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are in the early days of real equality that
              we all understand. However, I will, as a Member of the Committee
              of the Centre, along with my Colleagues, be looking at the role of
              the Office of the First Minister and Deputy Minister in the area
              of equality. We shall be looking carefully at implementation so
              that all the gaps are stopped. Like others, I welcome this. When I
              first looked at this motion, I thought it was perhaps too early.
              But I now believe, on the basis of comments made by others, that
              it has been timely, ensuring that we all know what we are in for
              in the coming months, and hope that we can all look each other in
              the face equally.</p>

              Equality Commission’s annual report. As most Members know,
              Assembly Members get most reports that go out, but it is
              significant that we do not get a copy of that particular one.
              Would it be in order for the Assembly to take that point up with
              the Equality Commission and ask it why it does not circulate this
              report annually to Members?</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Weir:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with the closing remark of my North
              Down Colleague Eileen&nbsp;Bell that this debate on the issue of
              equality is timely. However — and I shall come to the reasons
              presently — I take exception to the wording of the motion, which
              I feel is perhaps not quite so appropriate or timely. As the
              Member remarked the importance of equality, like many of these
              words, lies perhaps as much in perception as in reality.
              Unfortunately, for many within the Unionist community, the terms
              &quot;equality&quot; and &quot;Equality Commission&quot; conjure
              up other images. Indeed, their memories are very much drawn to the
              Fair Employment Commission, which for many in the Unionist
              community was heavily discredited. For many of them, it is
              difficult to approach this issue in the context of trying to
              create a situation where there is equality of opportunity, which
              should be our aim for everyone. Many Unionists will view the word
              &quot;equality&quot; in the same way many people viewed Eastern
              European states calling themselves &quot;democratic&quot; in the
              former Soviet era. A concern among many Unionists is whether the
              Equality Commission will simply be another exercise in
              discrimination against Unionists.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not think that should be the case, and I
              hope we shall all strive for a situation in which we have full
              equality of opportunity, not simply in religion, but, as has been
              mentioned, in gender, ethnic background and disability. All those
              things should be tackled.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This brings me to the nature of the motion
              itself. It is rather clumsily worded, for two conclusions could be
              drawn from it as to what is intended. Either we are congratulating
              the fact that work is going on in the area of equality, although
              to be congratulating people on the fact that the matter is being
              looked at without any examination as to the quality of the work
              itself seems to be a rather facile notion, or secondly, we are
              congratulating the output that has been achieved. Given that there
              was a deadline of 30&nbsp;June, it seems premature to be making a
              judgement on whether it is achieving, at this stage, its
              objectives. Indeed, we have heard a wide range of criticism from
              various Members. It may well be that, given time, those criticisms
              can be accepted and dealt with, but there is great concern that
              many of the responses which have been put forward are fairly
              inadequate and do not cover all the issues. In particular, given
              the concentration on religious discrimination, other issues such
              as gender discrimination and giving teeth to disability
              legislation have tended, in the past, to be pushed to one side.
              Before we make a judgement on whether the matter is being dealt
              with properly by the equality review, we need to look at the end
              product, rather than simply welcoming it at this stage.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I question the methodology that has been used.
              The sheer number of Departments and statutory bodies producing
              reports led to a period when all of us were deluged more or less
              every day with another report from another group. I wonder whether
              the idea of simply getting every Department or every group to
              produce its own report was the right approach.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also wonder whether the issue of equality
              could be better tackled by a more holistic approach which actually
              looked at the wider issues, and also whether Government resources
              have been wisely spent on these dozens of reports, rather than
              having been used to look at the issue in a broader frame. There is
              then a tendency to ignore a lot of the bigger issues.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For example, I have severe concerns, from a
              legal point of view, about some of the powers that the fair
              employment body had. We had a situation — I do not know whether
              it has been addressed yet — which particularly discriminated
              against employers. If an employer lost a case, he could not appeal
              in terms of quantum; he could appeal only in terms of law. There
              are a number of similar issues which I do not think —</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There have been a number of issues of that

              discrimination has been properly dealt with. I am not sure that
              simply pigeon-holing it into a wide range of Departments and minor
              Government bodies is the right way of dealing with it. It should
              have been dealt with centrally using a bigger approach.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I want to make an observation about this
              debate, which I hope will be heard by the bureaucracies inside and
              outside Government. There is a very high degree of consensus in
              the Chamber on this issue. There may be some difference of opinion
              — and there is some profound difference of opinion on the
              outworking of equality practice — but it is quite clear that,
              that aside, all those who have spoken today from all the parties
              now accept that there is an equality duty; that equality has been
              mainstreamed and that a culture of equality has to prevail inside
              government and beyond in the North. I have observed, not just for
              our own benefit but more to ensure that those who are in and close
              to government and those who are in public authorities in the North
              understand, that there is a high degree of political consensus on
              the issue of equality in the North, unlike at any other time in
              our history. Public authorities in particular need to acknowledge
              and accept that there is a growing consensus and cohesion and that
              whatever the past might have been, the political establishment in
              the North will increasingly make demands from public authorities
              to ensure that they fulfil their equality functions and equality
              duties.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While the Chamber understands that public
              authorities have taken time to come to terms with their new duty
              under the Northern Ireland Act and acknowledges that the
              outworking of that, at public authority level, is difficult and
              requires many changes, nevertheless it is appropriate to put on
              record what is expected of them. Other Members have referred to
              that already, so I will only mention two crucial requirements on
              public authorities which, to date, have not been reflected
              adequately or at all in the draft equality schemes that they have
              submitted to the Government.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first requirement is essential. Section 75
              lays two responsibilities on public authorities. There is concern
              that public authorities will concentrate on one to the absence of
              the other. That will not be accepted by politicians or by the
              Equality Commission in the North. The two duties are to pay due
              regard to the need to promote equality and opportunity and to have
              regard to the desirability of promoting good relations. We can
              easily imagine situations where, while fulfilling their equality
              of opportunity duty, they will respect community relations but
              fail to promote equality of opportunity as required by the
              legislation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Public authorities need to appreciate that the
              higher duty upon them is the need to fulfil equality of
              opportunity. While it is desirable to promote community relations,
              that is a lesser duty, even though it is a high duty that they owe
              to the local community. Public authorities need to be aware of the
              difference and of the primacy of the need to promote equality of
              opportunity rather than the desirability of promoting community
              relations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second point I want to make to the public
              authorities is that there is a lack of definition and detail in
              the draft equality schemes that they have submitted to the
              Government. They need to demonstrate much more conclusively that
              they are prepared to invest in the equality duty, the resources
              and all the other requirements necessary to see that it works in
              practice. In particular, they need to demonstrate more fully the
              requirement for training to be undertaken by public officials to
              ensure that the duty is fulfilled. They need to outline more
              clearly how resources are going to be invested to ensure that the
              duty is fulfilled, and how they are going to apply the principles
              of their equality schemes generally. They need to outline clarity
              in screening to ensure that we understand why public authorities
              select some of their functions rather than others when it comes to
              applying the public authority duty.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, and most centrally, the public
              authorities need to outline how each equality duty and equality
              scheme fulfils the Targeting Social Need requirement of
              Government. A former Secretary of State said Targeting Social Need
              was one of three compelling requirements of government in the
              North. Public authorities need to demonstrate that in practice in
              each area.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We hold these truths to be sacred and

              from that equal creation they derive rights inherent and

              liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That puts the proposer of the motion in
              perspective. It talks about equality, but the person who brought
              forward the motion is talking about a different type of equality
              which ignores the community that I come from and represent. They
              are here only because for 30 years they have tried to kill the
              Unionist community and put them under pressure.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to dwell upon some of the equality
              issues. They are issues that affect each and every one of us, are
              important to us all and affect many different parts of our
              community. When we talk about equality in relation to maternity
              services being moved from Jubilee to west Belfast, where is the
              equality for the community in east Belfast? Where is the equality
              when over £50 million is put into Irish language schools to the
              detriment of other schools and other education?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We now have two Ministers responsible for
              issues such as these. Perhaps they could start by looking at
              equality in their Departments and making sure that equality in
              every facet of life is looked at and dealt with. Unfortunately,
              many of us in the Unionist community feel that this equality
              legislation has failed to assure us that we are entitled to
              equality of treatment first, as every other part of the community
              is. Many Unionists look at it today and say &quot;No, we are not
              part of this equality agenda and we are going to lose out.&quot;</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those of us who are elected representatives,
              including councillors, will be snowed under by this mountain of
              paperwork that we have on equality issues from every Department
              looking for our opinions. I am concerned that what will result is
              legislation that the councils will not be able to operate fully
              because of the workload. Officers in my council have said that
              this will be a very difficult issue for them, taking so much time
              and manpower. Everything that happens in council and Government
              life will be affected by equality issues.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One item that I am glad will be included
              relates to planning, a matter of concern in the area I represent.
              Even though they make their representations to the Planning
              Service, many people feel that their opposition to planning
              developments that will directly affect the area they live in are
              not really considered. So I am glad to see that they will be able
              to request a hearing and have direct input into planning matters.
              This will allow them to feel that they are part of the process.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also concerned about senior citizens and
              those with disabilities. Those with disabilities have not had the
              full support of the law of the land over the last few years. Some
              people with disabilities are only being recognised now, and that
              is something that we want to see happening more at every level by
              councils, the Assembly and MPs. Our disabled people, senior
              citizens and those who deserve extra consideration must feel that
              this equality agenda involves them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also have a problem with equality of
              funding. Many parts of the Unionist community feel that they have
              not received as much funding from Europe as they should have. They
              wish to see the balance addressed so that all those who have not
              received the proper funding will feel part of the process.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are also looking for equality for
              Ulster-Scots. When it comes to handing out funding, there is no
              equality for that either. We want to see equality for the
              Ulster-Scots language, equality and parity of funding, full
              representation and the opportunity to express that language at
              every level of society.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, we must have every possible
              opportunity for everyone, and everybody in the community must feel
              part of it.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Inequality was, and still is, a potent issue in
              our divided society — indeed, it was historic inequality which
              gave rise to the Civil Rights Movement. The equality issues that
              we are debating today, and which form a central part of the Good
              Friday Agreement, are really the unfinished business of the Civil
              Rights Movement — a campaign which was prematurely interrupted
              by the divisive and bloody campaign of violence by both Republican
              and Loyalist paramilitaries. Happily, there now is a widespread,
              though belated, recognition that these issues of inequality and
              equality are much more productive in terms of bringing about a
              beneficial effect on our society than concentrating on what was
              called the national question.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.30 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SDLP welcomes the Good Friday Agreement’s
              emphasis on equality issues. I would particularly like to discuss
              the Secretary of State’s role under Section 75. First, it is
              vital that he designate UK authorities and public bodies involved
              in policing and other key areas so that the equality duty under
              section 75 applies to them. We are concerned that the Secretary of
              State has not said which bodies will be so designated. That has
              yet to be done. It is important that as many UK bodies as possible
              be designated. For example, the Department of Social Security
              should be designated, since its policies have a huge effect on
              parity issues in Northern Ireland. We have also publicly called
              for the Home Office and the Lord Chancellor’s Office to be
              designated. This would ensure fairness and equality in Northern
              Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Secretary of State has other important
              roles. Where the Equality Commission does not believe that a
              public authority’s draft equality scheme is adequate that scheme
              can be referred to the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State
              then has the choice of accepting the scheme, directing that it be
              revised, or making a new scheme for that body. This is a very
              important power. Where the Equality Commission receives a
              complaint that a public authority is not fulfilling its equality
              duty in practice it can investigate and, if it finds the complaint
              to be justified, refer it to the Secretary of State. In the case
              of Northern Ireland bodies, the Secretary of State can ultimately
              direct the body to take the necessary steps to remedy the problem.
              That is also a crucial power. It is important that the Secretary
              of State has a dedicated equality unit supporting him to ensure
              that section 75 is fully and effectively implemented.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In our view, the Secretary of State has a key
              role in the implementation of section 75 and in ensuring that the
              promise of the individual equality schemes is realised in
              practice. We hope that he will rise to this challenge.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the outset, I wish to say — and I am sure
              that my Colleagues will have pointed this out, in my absence, on
              behalf of the DUP — that we have absolutely no problem with the
              mainstreaming of the equality issue for Government Departments in
              Northern Ireland. Many people in the Unionist community are now
              experiencing the effects of unequal treatment and discrimination.
              It is essential that equality issues be brought to the fore.
              However, it is ironic — though perhaps not unexpected — that
              this issue has been brought before us by a party which, by its
              actions, shows that it has total contempt for equality on an
              almost daily basis. It really does not give two hoots about
              ensuring that people are treated equally. I have no doubt that at
              the end of this debate members of Sinn Féin will troop into this
              Assembly and through the voting lobby to vote for the motion.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I could mention them one by one, but I do not
              have time. I will just mention one. Maybe it should be indicated
              to Barry &quot;the bantam bully&quot; McElduff, that when we talk
              about not discriminating against people, or about promoting
              equality of opportunity between persons of different political
              opinions, that means not intimidating pensioners who happen to
              think that it is appropriate to sit on a police liaison committee.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Maybe he will also be informed that equality of
              opportunity means that if someone speaks to you in a language
              other than Irish, you do not pounce on him and abuse him. I have
              no doubt that Mr&nbsp;McElduff will raise his hand in support of
              this motion, but it is quite clear that he has not got a clue
              about what it means in practice.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will deal with some of the issues on the
              equality scheme. As I said at the outset, I have no difficulty in
              supporting a sensible equality scheme for Northern Ireland and for
              Departments in Northern Ireland. However, I will not make myself
              part of Sinn Féin’s abuse of this House. They pretend to
              support equality while in practice they ignore the issues of
              equality.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will outline where a lot of this equality
              legislation falls down. I have listened to Alban&nbsp;Maginness,
              who tells us that this is the culmination of the unfinished
              business of the Civil Rights Association. Over the last 30 years
              we have had legislation by the book load from Westminster. We have
              had Fair Employment legislation, Equal Opportunity legislation and
              all the rest, and we still hear the same old story from
              Nationalists that there is inequality.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps this illustrates the danger in thinking
              that the issue can be sorted out simply by providing a lot of
              legislation. First this equality legislation must not do away with
              individual responsibility. We have a list of rights for people in
              this society, but people tend to ignore their responsibilities in
              society. That should not be submerged in any discussion on
              individual rights.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, we run into danger when we elevate
              individual rights above the needs of society. It is important that
              this legislation should not go in that direction. I will draw my
              remarks to a close. There are many other points that I wish to
              make, but there is a very real danger that this legislation … <i>[Interruption]</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It will not take five minutes to make my simple
              point. I want to use the opportunity of this debate on equality to
              make the point that there is absolutely no evidence available to
              sustain the proposition that there ever was systematic
              discrimination against the Catholic community in Northern Ireland.
              If someone wants to dispute that, I had the pleasure of editing a
              book, that was published a few months ago, in which there is a
              chapter by Graham Gudgin dealing with the two fundamental claims
              made about the issue of equality — inequality in housing and
              inequality in jobs.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Gudgin has put forward arguments absolutely
              impossible for anyone familiar with the statistics to refute, and
              no one has ever even attempted it. No one from the Nationalist
              side of the House — or from among those who are committed to the
              idea that there was a long period of systematic inequality against
              Catholics in Northern Ireland — has ever even attempted it,
              because they know they could not sustain their arguments.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The argument about Catholic unemployment was
              something they discovered in 1971. Interestingly enough, it never
              formed a significant part of the civil rights programme. But in
              1971 the census showed that two and a half times more Catholics
              than Protestants were unemployed, and that figure has largely been
              sustained over a thirty-year period, despite the fair-employment
              legislation we have. Dr&nbsp;Gudgin and Prof Breen, who now holds
              a chair in Oxford and who was one of the top researchers in the
              Economic and Social Research Institute, published a paper a few
              years ago. This paper demonstrated that a high proportion of
              long-term unemployment among the Catholic population was simply
              due to the abnormally high rate of population increase in that
              section of the community. There were certain other factors, but
              that was a key one. Nobody has ever refuted those statistics from
              two of the top researchers in Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Statistics for employment since 1990
              demonstrate that the relative number of Protestants in employment
              has declined, while the number of Catholics has increased.
              Therefore, over a period, I and a number of other people carried
              on a public debate against the so-called Fair Employment
              Commission with the argument that fair-employment legislation
              massively discriminated against the Protestant community. It was
              so discriminatory that the commission’s own employment practices
              were way out of line with what they should have been. They were
              employing more Catholics than Protestants. I am sorry to have to
              use the terminology of Catholic and Protestant, but that is what
              other people have brought into the public domain.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This debate on equality is about two
              fundamental things. First it is an attempt, among other things, to
              undermine the legitimacy of Northern Ireland as part of the United
              Kingdom. The other side of the coin is that, given the absolute
              poverty of Irish Nationalism, a child — and I challenge anyone
              on the Nationalist side ever to meet me on a public platform to
              sustain their position — could demolish the Irish Nationalist
              case. In order to fortify it, they have developed the idea that
              there was massive discrimination against the Catholic community in
              Northern Ireland, which could only be rectified by 30&nbsp;years
              of unqualified barbarity and terrorism. Its purpose is not only to
              de-legitimise the status of Northern Ireland within the Union, but
              to legitimise 30 years of terrorism. That is what the argument is
              about. Having got this so-called equality agenda inserted into the
              Belfast Agreement, with the connivance of the Ulster Unionist
              Party, they are now systematically — <i>[Interruption]</p>

              being with Alice in Wonderland, where the world is topsy-turvy.
              Some of the comments that have been made are indicative of what
              has been the problem all along: Unionist denial that there has
              been institutionalised discrimination in this state since its
              inception, and that equality was placed at the centre of the Good
              Friday Agreement as a recognition of that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People need to get to grips with the reality of
              all this. There was a reference to Graham&nbsp;Gudgin and the work
              that he did. In the academic world a lot of his work has not been
              recognised or received very well. A large body of academic work
              lays down the proof of the inequalities that existed. One of the
              things that is very significant in this debate is that the DUP in
              particular, and Unionism in general, is arguing against equality.
              The question needs to be asked: who fears equality? Go raibh maith
              agat.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Junior Minister (Office of First and Deputy
              First Ministers (Mr Haughey): </b>I welcome the motion, and I
              agree with the Member who moved it that existing fair employment
              and equality legislation has not produced the degree or speed of
              change that I would have wished to see. This is shown by the
              persistence of the differentials between, for instance, men and
              women in terms of the income they derive from employment, in terms
              of unemployment rates between the two sections of our community
              and in a number of other ways.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The section 75 statutory obligations are an
              integral part of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 and they put the
              mainstreaming of equality onto a statutory basis for the first
              time ever. The mainstreaming of equality means ensuring that due
              regard is given to equality considerations in the decision-making
              processes of all public authorities. The benefits of this are very
              obvious — better decision making, since we will examine how
              different policy options could impact on different sections of the
              community; greater equality, since we will endeavour to ensure
              that equality of opportunity is promoted; and greater openness,
              since consultation with the wider members of civic society lies at
              the very core of section 75.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The statutory obligations arose out of the
              earlier administrative initiative — policy appraisal and fair
              treatment (PAFT). The Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights
              found that PAFT was not being implemented as it should have been
              and recommended that it be placed on a statutory footing to ensure
              better implementation. A commitment, therefore, to put PAFT on a
              statutory basis was subsequently included in the Good Friday
              Agreement. The statutory obligations are, therefore, not just
              legally binding, they are also among the key initiatives promised
              by the Good Friday Agreement. Implementing section 75 correctly
              and effectively must be a key priority for the Administration and
              for all of us. It is as simple as that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The obligation relates to a wide spectrum of
              equality of opportunity and not just to areas of religion,
              political opinion, gender, race and disability, where there are
              already laws against discrimination. Age, marital status, sexual
              orientation and whether one has dependants or not must also be
              taken into account. Section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act
              requires public authorities, in carrying out their functions, to
              have due regard to the need to promote equality of opportunity in
              all of these categories. They should also have regard to the need
              to promote good relations between people of different religions,
              political opinions and racial groups. I am not aware of any
              country that has created such a sophisticated framework for the
              mainstreaming of equality as we have here in Northern Ireland. We
              can rightly consider ourselves to be at the cutting edge and to be
              setting an example to the world in the promotion of best practice.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The obligations are to be implemented through
              equality schemes, which public authorities should submit to the
              Equality Commission by 30&nbsp;June 2000. A very wide process of
              consultation has been going on recently. This has included the
              11&nbsp;Northern Ireland Departments, and their consultations are
              coming to an end. The Executive Committee is committed to the
              effective implementation of the section 75 obligations, which is a
              legal requirement.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the Office of the First Minister and Deputy
              First Minister, we see section 75 as an important part of the
              equality agenda and of promoting better community relations —
              both of which are our responsibility. Section 75 of the Government
              of Ireland Act is a reserved matter under which the Secretary of
              State has specific responsibilities in relation to agreed
              guidelines from the Equality Commission, designating additional
              public authorities and dealing with equality schemes referred to
              him by the Commission.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot answer for the Secretary of State in
              the discharge of these functions. However, we can state our
              commitment that the Northern Ireland Departments will submit
              comprehensive and effective equality schemes to the Equality
              Commission, it is to be hoped by the end of the month. However,
              given the difficulties of recent months, there may be some
              slippage — something we hope to keep to an absolute minimum.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The schemes, which are currently out for
              consultation, were approved for publication during suspension by
              Northern Ireland Office Ministers. Much work remains to be done to
              improve the draft equality schemes over coming weeks. I agree with
              the criticisms made of some of those we have seen. The equality
              schemes are a new initiative, and consultation is raising a number
              of interesting points, as many Members have pointed out. I am also
              taking my own view of the schemes, and the Equality Unit is
              currently considering how best to ensure that the devolved
              Administration takes forward that work over the coming weeks.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ministers in the Executive Committee will also
              pay attention to how consultation responses have been taken into
              account in the finalised equality schemes.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Equality Unit in the Office of the First
              and Deputy First Minister has assisted Departments with guidance
              and training on these statutory obligations. That will continue in
              coming months as Departments implement their equality schemes. In
              particular, equality impact assessments on new and existing
              policies will introduce a new element to the administrative
              culture of Northern Ireland. It will place emphasis on analysis,
              openness, consultation and consideration of alternatives. This is
              an important element in our new institutional arrangements, and I
              hope it will contribute to the effective promotion of equality of
              opportunity.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are happy to support this motion and we
              fully welcome section 75 of the Government of Ireland Act.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the debate a considerable number of
              points have been made by Members. Many of them have been extremely
              constructive and require positive answers from the Executive
              Committee. It is not possible in the time I have left to deal with
              all of them. Junior Minister Nesbitt will deal with as many as
              possible in seven and a half minutes, and we will undertake to
              reply in writing to those Members who do not have an answer to the
              questions they have raised today.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Junior Minister (Office of First and Deputy
              First Ministers) (Mr Nesbitt): </b>First, I reply to Mr Poots with
              respect to the European Union funding. Yes, that is an equality
              aspect; yes, it is being dealt with in cross-cutting measures;
              yes, a need has been identified for an outreach approach, since
              the Protestant community has not been as active as it should have
              been in applying for European Union funds. Equality is being dealt
              with in that manner.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I refer to points made by Mr&nbsp;Poots,
              Mr&nbsp;Weir — with respect to another form of discrimination
              against Unionists, if that is what Unionists see as equality —
              and Mr&nbsp;Shannon, who said that Unionists see equality as just
              not including them. That may, but should not, be the case.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Equality is for all, and for the benefit of all
              if it is properly applied. I agree with Mr&nbsp;S&nbsp;Wilson’s
              first comment that the Unionist community, or any community, has
              nothing to fear in dealing appropriately with equality. That is
              why I am happy to reflect those views.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to Prof&nbsp;McWilliams’s point
              about the timescale, she may be right. However, there is a
              legislative limit which states that it must take place by
              30&nbsp;June, and therefore consultation is taking place over
              eight weeks. When the consultation comes back the Executive will
              make sure that that aspect is fully dealt with. The Ministers will
              be committed to those schemes.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Mr Speaker in the Chair)</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With reference to Mr&nbsp;Shannon’s point
              about the Ulster-Scots language, he is correct in a sense.
              However, there is no scope in section 75 to deal with language. It
              is a reserved matter, the responsibility of Westminster, and when
              it, dealt with it Parliament did not accept the language balance
              of Ulster-Scots versus Irish or English. However, I draw the
              attention of all Members who raised that question to the
              commitment in the Good Friday Agreement to minority languages, and
              to Ulster-Scots. There is also a commitment given regarding the
              Council of Europe’s Charter for Regional or Minority Languages,
              and that has been implemented.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I regret that Mr&nbsp;Roche is not here, and I
              trust that he will read avidly what I am about to say. <i>[Interruption]</i>
              I sometimes wonder which side of the House some Members are on,
              from the point of view of Unionism. That is why I used those
              precise words.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Roche talked about the connivance of
              the Ulster Unionist Party on the equality agenda. I refute that
              out of hand. I personally wrote the minority report of the
              Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights. I am actually doing
              something about equality for Unionists. Mr&nbsp;Roche and others
              would not even have an Assembly here, and they would have the
              affairs of Northern Ireland dealt with by the Government at
              Westminster whom they all say they cannot trust.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My last point is an important and sensitive
              one. Mr&nbsp;C Murphy mentioned that Catholics are still more than
              twice as likely to be unemployed as Protestants. Let me say
              something very clearly, and not out of a sense of bravado as some
              others might. I am very conscious of where I stand and that what I
              say is recorded; therefore I measure my words very carefully.
              There are two statistics and this is confusing. I note what
              Mr&nbsp;Campbell said about the percentage of recruitment. When
              one talks about Catholics being twice as likely to be unemployed
              as Protestants, one is dealing with the actual stock of
              unemployment, which has absolutely nothing to do with recruitment.
              While I accept that the proportion of Catholic unemployed is
              higher than Protestant unemployed, it has nothing to do with
              discrimination.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.00 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me make it clear that there is no automatic
              link whatsoever between unemployment rates and whether or not
              there is equality of opportunity. There are many things that have
              an impact, such as immigration, retirement patterns and the
              likelihood of people wishing to work.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, let me make it very clear — <i>[Interruption]</p>
              </i><b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Nesbitt:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am happy to wait for order.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is perfectly possible to have both fair
              employment and equality of opportunity, and to have the
              differential in unemployment statistics unchanged. There is no
              a&nbsp;priori link between unemployment differentials and
              discrimination. The sad point about unemployment differentials and
              equality of opportunity — and it is something that I put into
              print several years ago, and I repeat it now as this is a very
              sensitive issue — is that it has both communities in Northern
              Ireland feeling ill at ease with one another. In simple terms, the
              Catholic community in Northern Ireland feels it is discriminated
              against, and, at the same time, the Protestant community feels
              that it is being told that it is a discriminating group. Both
              communities are incorrect in their perceptions. Therefore, this
              aspect of unemployment differential must be very carefully stated
              in measured tones on all occasions.</p>

              Mr&nbsp;Nesbitt speaks for me, or, indeed, I for him. We are both
              responding in a general sense on behalf of the Administration.
              Obviously we have different views, otherwise there would be no
              need for the Good Friday Agreement, and we cannot, and do not,
              presume to speak for each other in that particular sense.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will take a point of order from Mr&nbsp;Dodds
              before responding to Mr&nbsp;Haughey’s point of order.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is helpful that the junior Minister has
              clarified that he was speaking not on behalf of the Executive as a
              whole but for himself and his party, and that the same applied to
              Mr&nbsp;Nesbitt. It shows the nature of collective responsibility
              we have under this scheme.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Haughey referred to section 75 of the
              Government of Ireland Act, and I would be interested to know what
              he meant by that.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is not an opportunity for you to ask
              further questions of the junior Minister. It was a point of order
              that you raised, and this is a matter for the Chair to respond to,
              along with the previous point of order from the junior Minister,
              Mr&nbsp;Haughey. My understanding about the way in which a
              Minister responds by way of a winding-up speech is that he is
              speaking on behalf of the Executive, whereas junior Ministers are
              speaking on behalf of their principals.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I call upon the Member who moved the motion to
              respond if he so wishes.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr C Murphy:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh. This has
              been a very useful and informative debate. There were a number of
              relevant points, and I thank all of the Members for their
              contributions. I also thank the two junior Ministers from the
              Office of the First and Deputy First Ministers for attending and
              giving a view from that Office and from the Executive.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Éamonn ONeill queried the intention of the
              motion. As I said at the outset, the purpose of the motion was to
              give the Assembly an opportunity to discuss this matter and to
              comment on the production of equality schemes at a time when they
              are out for consultation and before the deadline is reached, so
              that the views of the elected representatives could be given.
              People felt that during the period of suspension — and it has
              been reflected in many of the contributions today — proper
              adherence to the equality requirements seemed to have slipped. I
              thought that it was an opportune time for public representatives
              to give their views on this matter.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion is positive, and it was not by my
              design but was the result of the method by which it was agreed by
              the Business Committee. If I had had proper time to draft the
              motion and get it in front of the Business Committee, I imagine
              that it would have reflected the great degree of scepticism
              expressed by many. That was my view on the issue.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In order to get the debate aired I undertook to
              submit a take-note motion which mentioned equality schemes and
              allowed Members to make their contributions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad to hear, from Mr&nbsp;Poots’s
              contribution, that the DUP shares many of the concerns of everyone
              else on equality. I am glad that many of its Members expressed
              their commitment to equality, but they need to recognise that
              where inequalities exist — some of them do recognise this and
              some of them do not — they need to be properly addressed to make
              sure that we are all starting from a level playing field.</p>

              figures, if Mr&nbsp;Poots could provide us with the 2001 census
              figures, he should be elevated to the Front Bench. The 1991
              figures are the only ones we have to work from.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the remarks of Prof&nbsp;McWilliams
              and agree that while some of the public bodies that responded
              appear to be making genuine efforts, that was the case with too
              few. I share particular concerns about the equality schemes
              produced by the Departments under our jurisdiction. I hope that
              the junior Ministers present will note the concerns that were
              expressed across the House today and that we will find them
              reflected in the work of the Executive and, in turn, of the
              Departments.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Similar concerns were expressed by
              Patricia&nbsp;Lewsley over disability discrimination. I share her
              view that the full use of section 75 would give proper effect to
              the Disability Discrimination Act.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was interesting to hear
              Gregory&nbsp;Campbell’s commitment to equality, particularly
              where it concerns disability and gender. It has been a noted trait
              of the DUP in general and of himself in particular that they
              display particular vehemence or disdain towards female Members of
              the House. Yet they allege commitment to gender equality. They
              seem to reserve particular vitriol for women Members speaking from
              this side of the House, from whatever party they happen to belong
              to. I would like to see their commitment to gender equality put
              into practice when people are speaking.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">His figures remind me of King&nbsp;Canute, or
              Paddy Roche, or, indeed, David&nbsp;Irving. Not our David&nbsp;Ervine
              but the Holocaust historian. It reminds me somewhat of the stand
              King&nbsp;Canute took, in the face of all historical research and
              evidence, in an attempt to argue his case.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Michelle&nbsp;Gildernew paid particular
              attention to some of the public bodies and bodies in receipt of
              public funding that have not yet been designated by Peter&nbsp;Mandelson.
              Other Members also drew attention to that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On Peter&nbsp;Weir’s contribution, I am sorry
              — and other Unionists reflect this — that many Unionists see
              the equality agenda as threatening to their perspective.
              Dermot&nbsp;Nesbitt quite rightly said that this is not the case
              and should not be the case. Leaders from within the Unionist
              community must stress to them that equality is something which
              threatens nobody here. It is of benefit to everyone. He was quite
              detailed in his criticisms of my motion and of the many efforts
              that have been made to address equality, although he was vague on
              alternative solutions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alex&nbsp;Attwood’s contributions reflected
              the intention of the motion, which was to air this issue in the
              Chamber. I am glad that it appears to have worked out that way,
              and I hope that the views from the Chamber will be reflected in
              the work of public bodies and the Departments. People here are
              dissatisfied with the standard of the equality schemes produced so
              far. They are dissatisfied that the bodies all appear to be
              working off one template, and that leads to great concern about
              the intent behind them. This is a serious issue, and Alex&nbsp;Attwood

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since the Member has said on a number of
              occasions that he is dissatisfied with the work being done, why

              explained the way in which the motion was put to the Business
              Committee in my absence. Perhaps he likes to pose questions but
              not listen to the answers. This was the way of airing the matter
              that was agreed through the Business Committee — a take-note
              motion to get the issue of equality schemes on the agenda. I do
              note with approval some of the work that is being carried out.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is quite obvious that Mr&nbsp;Weir has no
              one to represent him at the Business Committee, something which
              speaks for his current position of somewhat splendid isolation on
              the Unionist Benches. He has no one to represent him, otherwise
              the Chief Whip of the Unionist Party would have been able to
              inform him that, in his absence from the Business Committee, an
              undertaking was given that a generally positive motion on this
              issue would be presented to the Assembly. The other members of the
              Business Committee, to their credit, accepted that without
              prejudice to other motions that might be put, and that was the
              manner in which the motion was put on the agenda. I am sorry that
              Mr Weir does not have anyone from the Business Committee to speak
              to him, but if he engaged with some of the other parties they
              might fill him in. <i>[Interruption]</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was represented there, and that is how the
              motion got on the agenda — with the agreement of the party of
              the Minister for Social Development.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to Mr&nbsp;Shannon’s
              contribution, I should like to inform him that Jubilee Hospital
              is, in fact, in south Belfast and not in the east, as he referred
              to.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad to hear that Ards Borough Council, of
              which he is a member, is beginning to address this issue and
              appreciate the seriousness of its responsibilities under
              section&nbsp;75 of the equality requirements, and is beginning to
              prepare for this, however begrudgingly his portrayal of what the
              council is doing appears to be.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with Alban&nbsp;Maginness that the
              Secretary of State has a huge responsibility in this, with much
              more to do by way of designation, and that we may well be looking
              to him to use his authority in enforcing adherence to equality
              requirements. That is something we need to bear in mind.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As for Sammy&nbsp;Wilson’s contribution, it
              is somewhat amusing to receive a lecture about equality from
              someone who revelled over many years in being an arch-bigot of the
              city hall. He is somewhat confused, telling us on the one hand
              that members of the Nationalist community had plenty of
              legislation to deal with employment discrimination over the years
              with which they should have been satisfied, yet we are in danger
              of creating too much legislation now. On the one hand we should be
              satisfied with loads of it, but we should not desire any more.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased that the junior Ministers
              representing the office in which the equality unit is located,
              particularly Mr&nbsp;Haughey, are in agreement with many of the
              points I made in my opening remarks concerning dissatisfaction
              with the equality schemes. I am also pleased and encouraged to
              hear that implementing section&nbsp;75 is a key priority for the
              Executive. I undertake to hold the Departments to his commitment
              to adequate equality schemes, and I agree that much work needs to
              be done in ensuring that these are adequate and not the shadow
              ones we have had so many of to date.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As for Dermot&nbsp;Nesbitt’s analysis of the
              unemployment differentials, I shall merely say that many noted
              academics, and indeed many of his own ministerial Colleagues,
              would disagree with his analysis. I beg to differ.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Nesbitt:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me make it very clear. I am not quoting
              Colleagues. I refer to the Standing Advisory Commission on Human
              Rights, the Statistical and Research Agency and others who have
              made it abundantly clear. I made it clear I was not making a
              comment about discrimination, but rather about unemployment
              differential as an indication of discrimination. There is not
              necessarily any a priori link between the two.</p>
              <b>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Doctors differ and patients die. With no
              disrespect to any of the doctors present, I contest some of the
              analysis, and I believe that many other people in that field would
              do likewise.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am disappointed by the lack of participation
              from the Ulster Unionist Party. Mr&nbsp;Nesbitt is here
              representing the Executive, not his own party, and I am
              disappointed that, apart from one unauthorised Member, nobody else
              spoke on behalf of the Ulster Unionist Party.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The absence of many Members from the Benches
              opposite is somewhat disappointing for those of us who believe
              that all who signed up to the Good Friday Agreement felt that
              equality was a central aspect of it. I am glad to hear that
              reaffirmed by Mr&nbsp;Nesbitt but, again, he is speaking on behalf
              of the Executive and not on behalf of his party. I would have
              preferred it if Members from the Ulster Unionist Party had taken
              part in the debate and had given their views on equality schemes,
              section&nbsp;75, and the full implementation of all of that.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The purpose of the debate was to allow Members’
              views to be aired on this issue. This is our first opportunity to
              put motions down since we came back. It is a very important time.
              Equality schemes are out there at the moment, they are doing the
              rounds, and they are out for consultation. As
              Monica&nbsp;McWilliams pointed out, very few of them have come to
              Assembly Members for any detailed consultation, other than a quick
              response and a very limited consultation period. This was a good
              opportunity for Members to air their feelings, and there was a
              broad degree of dissatisfaction. I hope that is reflected through
              the junior Minister to the Executive and into the Departments —
              those were some of the most disappointing equality schemes — and
              also into all the public bodies. I hope that the views, the
              general sense of this debate and the contributions made today are
              reflected back. That was the purpose of putting this motion on the
              agenda; there was no other purpose. If that is reflected back and
              comes back out in a much improved sense of intent and commitment
              to the proper implementation of equality, as required under
              section&nbsp;75 of the Act, this will have been a beneficial
              debate.</p>
