    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="1"></a>Assembly Business</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">New Assembly Members: Mr Conall McDevitt and Mr  Jonathan Bell</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have been informed by the Chief Electoral Officer that Mr Conall McDevitt has  been returned as a Member for the South Belfast constituency to fill the  vacancy resulting from the resignation of Mrs Carmel Hanna and that Mr Jonathan  Bell has been returned as a Member for the Strangford constituency to fill the  vacancy resulting from the resignation of Mrs Iris Robinson.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McDevitt signed the Roll of Membership in my presence  and that of the Clerk to the Assembly/Director General in the Speaker&rsquo;s Office  on Thursday 21 January 2010. Mr Bell signed the Roll of Membership earlier  today. Both Members have entered their designations and have now taken their  seats.</p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading"><a name="2"></a>Assembly Commission</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I wish to inform the Assembly that a vacancy exists on the Assembly Commission.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As with other similar motions, the motion to appoint a  Member to fill that vacancy will be treated as a business motion, and, therefore,  there will be no debate. Before I proceed to the Question, I advise Members  that the motion requires cross-community support.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved (with cross-community support):</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That, in accordance with Standing Order 79(4), Mr Alex  Attwood be appointed to fill a vacancy on the Assembly Commission &mdash; &nbsp;<span class="Italic">[Mr P Ramsey.]</span></p>
    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="3"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Economic Development Policy</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice from the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment that she  wishes to make a statement.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (Mrs Foster)</strong>: I wish  to make a statement on how I propose to take forward economic development  policy in Northern Ireland.  My decisions are based on the independent review of economic policy, the  outcome of the consultation exercise on that review and my discussions with key  stakeholders on the report and its recommendations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Members will be aware, I commissioned the independent  review in December 2008. Its overarching aim was to assess the policy of the  Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI) and Invest NI to  determine whether it was sufficient to help to deliver the productivity goal  contained in the Programme for Government. In light of that, I asked for a root  and branch review of economic development policy. I am grateful to the panel  for its report, which was published on 29 September 2009, and for its detailed  and wide-ranging recommendations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Given the strategic importance of the review, not least  because the economy is the Executive&rsquo;s top priority, I issued the report for a  short six-week period of public consultation, which ended on 16 November 2009.  I am grateful to the 69 respondents, and, as part of today&rsquo;s statement, I will  publish a consultation report containing a summary of what was said during the  consultation and provide access to the more detailed responses. Those responses  added to the review and helped to shape the actions that I will outline.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Aside from responding to the recommendations, which I will  detail shortly, I must say that the timing of the report is of immense  significance. It comes at a time when we are working to rebuild the local  economy, which, in common with that of other parts of the United Kingdom  and beyond, has suffered and continues to suffer as a result of the global  downturn. Since December 2008, the number of unemployment claimants has  increased by almost 18,000, and many businesses have been forced to cut back or  cease operations. Compared with the previous year, those factors contributed to  a 63% increase in the number of redundancies notified to my Department.  Moreover, the construction sector has been significantly hit by the downturn,  and there have also been marked declines over the year in the output of other  sectors, including manufacturing and services.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the fact that many economic commentators are  beginning to forecast some improvements in the local, national and global  economies in 2010. There are some signs that the impact of the downturn may be  starting to ease in Northern    Ireland. For example, the latest increase in  the claimant count is significantly below the average monthly increase  experienced over the past year. As we work to implement the findings of the  review, my aim is to improve further the prospects for economic growth and  higher living standards throughout Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Turning to the independent review, I warmly welcome the  report and its recommendations. The report recognises the need to provide  short-term support for companies along the lines of what we have being doing to  ease pressures resulting from the recession. However, for the medium to long  term, the review also endorses the policy ambitions of the Executive, namely to  build a more value-added and productive economy. As I will describe later, many  of the recommendations will be implemented by my Department and Invest NI as  soon as practicable. Others, by their very nature, will require further  analysis and discussion, which is to be expected given the strategic nature and  importance of the issues that they cover.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A vital aspect of the review is that it clearly states that  efforts to raise living standards and productivity in Northern Ireland  cannot lie solely at the door of DETI or Invest NI. Other Departments also have  important roles to play, particularly in terms of skills, planning and  investment in infrastructure. Furthermore, as the review highlights, it is  ultimately the responsibility of companies in the private sector to invest in  areas such as skills, exports, R&amp;D and innovation to boost competiveness. I  will return to how I intend to handle the cross-departmental proposals later in  my statement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Notwithstanding those issues, the report of Professor Barnett  and his colleagues represents a significant piece of work that will help to shape  economic development policy in Northern    Ireland, particularly as we enter the new  decade with its challenges and opportunities. Today&rsquo;s statement outlines my  position on the recommendations, and I have asked my Department&rsquo;s permanent  secretary to establish, with immediate effect, a steering group to implement  the actions that I wish to take forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The group will include representatives from Invest Northern  Ireland,  and I will look to the group to report regularly to me on progress towards  implementation. To add a degree of independence, Dr Ian McMorris, who is an  independent board member of my Department, and Dr Bill McGinnis, who is the Northern Ireland  skills adviser, have agreed to join the steering group. They will each add an  important external voice, particularly in respect of their considerable  experience in the business community.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The steering group will be supported by four implementation  groups, which will be chaired at a senior level and will include, where  appropriate, officials from other Executive Departments. Each of those groups  will oversee the implementation of recommendations that fall within the areas  of the co-ordination of economic policy in Northern Ireland; DETI and Invest  Northern Ireland&rsquo;s assistance to industry; autonomy, flexibility and  decision-making; and policy development and monitoring.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will now outline my response to the major recommendations  of the independent report, and I will do so in the four areas that I have just  mentioned. I will begin with some comments on the recommendations that were  made on strengthening the co-ordination of economic policy in Northern Ireland.  The most significant is that the core economic functions that cover existing  DETI and Department for Employment and Learning (DEL) areas of responsibility  should be brought together under a single Department of the economy. As I have  mentioned previously in this House, that is something that I support strongly.  It is imperative that we work to reduce the number of Government Departments in  Northern Ireland, and the  rationale for bringing together the responsibilities of DETI and DEL is very strong and  clear. Without doubt, skills are a critical factor in economic development, not  just for businesses locally but as a means of attracting value-added and internationally  mobile companies to locate and develop their business operations here in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, DETI and DEL  already work together closely in order to align policy and match the demand and  supply of skills. That has been acknowledged in the report, but the panel has  stated rightly that we can and should go further. It has argued that bringing  together the responsibilities under a single Department would ensure the  maximum possible flexibility and respons&shy;iveness to business needs, both for  local companies and to attract and retain international businesses.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I have indicated, the merits of the proposal are very  clear. I support the recommendation to create a Department that has a much  broader policy remit than either DETI or DEL. However, as I indicated earlier,  a number of the panel&rsquo;s recommendations will inevitably require further  analysis and discussion. In some instances, they will also require agreement  with Executive colleagues. This is clearly one such recommendation. Therefore,  I have today issued a paper to my Executive colleagues seeking their agreement  to consider the creation of a Department of the economy as part of the planned  review of strand-one institutions. However, I also recognise fully, as the  review panel did, that getting agreement and implementing new departmental  structures is something that presents its own challenges and will inevitably  take some time. That is why I also advocate in the Executive paper that we take  the interim steps that were suggested by the panel to improve the structures  that are currently in place.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Central to that is the establishment of a subcommittee of  the Executive to prioritise cross-departmental action on the economy and to  address not only the recommendations that fall to my Department but those that  cover issues such as skills, planning and infrastructure. I welcome the  proposals that Minister Poots put forward as part of his Executive paper on  planning reform. I welcome particularly the fact that a number of the proposals  in the Executive paper on planning are aligned with the recommendations that  were made in the independent report.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In reaching Executive agreement on the establishment of a  subcommittee, it will, of course, be imperative that we are clear on its  membership and remit, and discussions will need to be held about those matters.  However, while recognising that developing the economy cuts across all  Departments, I envisage that, initially, the subcommittee should comprise  Ministers who are currently responsible for the delivery of the Programme for  Government goal of improving private sector productivity. That embraces DETI, DEL,  and the Department for Regional Development (DRD), but it should also include  the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister (OFMDFM) and the  Department of Finance and Personnel (DFP), given their central role. I expect  that other Ministers will be involved as specific issues arise.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The panel suggested that the subcommittee should take  forward the development of an economic strategy for Northern Ireland that builds on the  findings of the review. Given that Northern Ireland is a small region,  we should work to produce a single overarching economic strategy that aligns  with and helps to shape other Executive strategies. It is vital to have that  strategy in place to grow the economy as Northern Ireland emerges from the  recession to ensure that we are able to compete more effectively, regionally  and globally and to help to prioritise resources. I further suggest that such a  new economic strategy should be at the heart of the next Programme for  Government. Therefore, my paper to the Executive proposes that the subcommittee  should begin to work on the development of an economic strategy, which should  be completed well before the end of this calendar year in time to inform the  Executive&rsquo;s next Programme for Government and Budget, which will take effect  from April 2011.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I look forward to discussing those important issues with my  Executive colleagues and to agreeing on how we take them forward as a matter of  urgency. I stress that I am not relying solely on the new measures that I have  outlined. To that end, I today welcome two important and significant  initiatives on skills. First, as part of the incentive to attract new  investments and expansions in Northern Ireland,  DEL and Invest Northern Ireland will take forward a pilot project  designed to offer an assured provision of a skilled workforce tailored to  companies&rsquo; specific needs, based on a successful model of support in North Carolina. The details  will soon be announced by the Minister for Employment and Learning. Secondly, DEL and Invest Northern Ireland are collaborating in the  development of an integrated framework for management and leadership to improve  support in that important area, as highlighted in the independent report.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members are also aware that the independent panel made  recommendations about how we might better tailor the assistance that DETI and  Invest Northern Ireland  offer business. Before I turn to those recommendations, I will touch briefly on  the range of businesses that we assist.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The review panel highlighted a concern that Invest Northern  Ireland support is not available for a large section of businesses in Northern  Ireland that fail to meet eligibility criteria. In particular, it has been  recommended that the concept of Invest Northern Ireland  &ldquo;clients&rdquo; should be removed to allow Invest Northern Ireland to work through the entire  business base to provide support for innovation, research and development, and  export growth.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In reflecting on that recommendation, I acknowledge that  Invest Northern Ireland currently supports the wider business base through many  initiatives, including export programmes, which are available to any company in  Northern Ireland that wishes to explore new markets; new schemes, such as  innovation vouchers and the growth programme, which target small and micro  businesses; advisory support, such as the credit crunch initiatives that I  launched in 2008; and, of course, nibusinessinfo.co.uk, an online business  advice service.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to recognise the need to maintain an  ongoing relationship with businesses in which many of our investments span a  number of years. It is also imperative that Invest NI can fully monitor the  performance of individual companies through the various stages of financial  assistance. In that light, I have asked Invest NI&rsquo;s chief executive to review  how the organisation could develop a tiered portfolio of support across the  wider business base to accelerate innovation and export growth. As part of that  review, I have also asked for the development of a small business unit to be  considered. It could fit within the model to provide a more dedicated resource  to supporting small businesses throughout Northern Ireland, in particular to  open up supply chain opportunities similar to those that have already been  developed for the aerospace sector. Invest NI will bring forward its proposals  by September 2010.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">An important aspect of the review will be to examine how  small business support is co-ordinated with district councils in the context of  the review of public administration. It is evident today that, although I am  keen that support be offered as widely as possible, it must be stressed that we  are in a much tighter public expenditure environment than we have ever been  before. That inevitably means that difficult decisions must be taken to  prioritise our limited resources in favour of businesses and projects that  offer the greatest potential for raising living standards and private sector productivity  in Northern Ireland.  In doing so, we must focus on projects that offer the greatest return to the  economy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to recognise the fact that support is not  just about financial assistance. The companies that I meet often comment on the  real benefit of the practical, advisory help that they receive from Invest NI  on a diverse range of issues, such as researching new markets, intellectual  property or the strategic direction of a business.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That leads me to comment on the assistance that DETI and  Invest NI provide to industry. A fundamental issue at the heart of the  independent report is the view that there needs to be an accelerated shift  towards support for innovation and R&amp;D from employment-based schemes, such  as selective financial assistance (SFA). First, the report highlights the very  real prospect that regional aid limits for the support that we offer to  projects through SFA will be reduced significantly. That process has already  started, and we will see major changes from the end of 2010. Secondly, the  panel drew on a substantial body of evidence that suggests that innovation  should be considered as the primary productivity driver for a regional economy  such as Northern Ireland.  In particular, innovation is critical if local firms are to maintain and  improve their competitive&shy;ness in export markets. Together, those factors  provide both a push and a pull in the direction of increasing support for  innovation and R&amp;D. I fully accept that analysis, and, indeed, it must be  recognised that, in recent years, Invest NI has already taken action to skew  more resources towards innovation and R&amp;D support.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For example, the independent panel acknowledged that, in  2008-09, compared with the previous six-year period, assistance for innovation  and R&amp;D increased by 20% in real terms. In the current financial year, that  level of assistance accelerated as a result of Invest NI increasing its budget  allocation for innovation and R&amp;D by a further 30%, which represents a  shift of more than 60% in the past two years. Expenditure on innovation and  R&amp;D now accounts for 38% of programme spend. I have asked my officials to  continue to look for ways to maintain that trend.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The independent panel made a number of specific recommendations  in relation to the portfolio of innovation policies and support programmes that  are currently on offer. In particular, the panel suggested that the innovation system  in Finland  is an example of best practice and should be explored further. My Department  has already started a thorough and comprehensive review of best practice in  economic development policy in other small, open economies throughout the  world, including Finland,  aimed at identifying transferrable lessons for Northern Ireland. The report on  that work is due in late spring, and it will be used to inform the development  of future policies and programmes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The independent panel further recommended that additional  support for innovation and R&amp;D should not involve new public expenditure.  Instead, it should be financed from savings in other areas, particularly grant  support, in respect of which there were concerns about the low value-added  nature of some of the projects that were supported, and, most notably, business  expansions, in which there was lower additionality in certain areas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That touches on the key issue of DETI and Invest NI  assistance to industry. I shall, therefore, highlight a number of points on the  use of financial assistance. First, I repeat my firm belief that there is no  evidence in the report that resources have been wasted. Indeed, the review  panel recognised that Invest NI has made a significant contribution to economic  and employment growth in Northern    Ireland. Furthermore, the panel reported  that, per capita, Northern Ireland  has the most successful record in the UK for attracting foreign direct  investment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, the review report makes specific recommendations  about the assistance that is offered to business expansion projects. However,  it is important to recognise the realities of business investment, whereby  companies often test the market with an initial investment before building an  operation to a critical mass using a series of subsequent investments, often by  adding new and other mobile functions. On occasion, those subsequent  investments may require support from Invest NI.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Thirdly, the panel rightly recognised that we are entering  a period when the availability of public expenditure is tightening and, against  that backdrop, it did not wish to present a set of proposals that would,  unrealistically, require significant sums of additional moneys. However, in  recognising that reality, it is also important to reassure Members about the  existence of the industrial development guarantee, which is designed to ensure:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;that no worthwhile proposal for eligible support to  investment in industry or tradable service will be lost&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I mentioned earlier, we are entering a new policy  framework in which changes to state-aid limits from the end of this calendar  year mean that, going forward, we will not be able to support business using  SFA in either the way that we have done to date or to the same extent.  Therefore, we must look to increase support for businesses using other existing  or newly developed instruments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The critical issue is how we should be deploying SFA now  and in the run up to 2013 when we may lose it as a policy instrument. My view  is that we should continue to use SFA for as long as we can, particularly as we  seek to rebuild the economy in the aftermath of the recession. However, going  forward in non-recessionary years, we also need to consider how we best deploy  SFA effectively to improve productivity. That was a key point in the report. My  view is that SFA should be used in the future to support investment in  indigenous companies and to help to attract new and potential follow-on  investments to Northern    Ireland. That must be the key to improving  relative living standards here.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I accept that it is a challenging area and one on which  there are a number of views. During the consultation process, concerns were  raised, principally from business organisations, about increasing the level of  support for innovation and R&amp;D at the expense of SFA. In that light, I have  asked the implementation group covering DETI and Invest Northern Ireland  assistance to industry to bring forward recommendations on when and where we  should be using SFA. That could potentially involve setting higher job-quality  thresholds than those that are currently in place. It may also improve  supporting certain strategically important projects and those that are in areas  of particular economic need. However, I stress that given the nature of our  work, where multi-year financial support packages are agreed with businesses,  it should be recognised that there will be limited scope to change Invest NI  spending in 2010-11. It is, therefore, about preparing for change for the new  Programme for Government period starting in 2011-12, although we will, of  course, need to ensure that we are careful not to take any actions now or to  enter into new commitments that would unduly compromise our room to manoeuvre  in the future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Moreover, looking forward to 2013, with the very real  prospect of significant reductions to regional aid, I reassure Members that I  and my Executive colleagues will be doing all that we can to secure the best  deal for Northern Ireland.  I have, therefore, asked my officials to begin preparing a case with other  relevant bodies to seek to maximise state-aid cover for any future SFA-type  programmes post-December 2013 and for other programmes that are designed to  support business competitiveness, particularly in the areas of innovation and  R&amp;D.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My comments so far have focused on SFA. That is  appropriate, given that the programme accounts for around 40% of Invest NI  support and given that it was also the subject of much of the panel&rsquo;s analysis.  However, Invest Northern    Ireland also offers a wide range of other  programmes to assist businesses; indeed, the independent report also commented  on those. In fact, the report suggests that Invest Northern Ireland&rsquo;s offering  is unnecessarily complex, and it proposes that the number of programmes be  reduced. I know that Invest Northern Ireland has made good progress in  rationalising its programmes, but I believe that further progress could be  made. Therefore, I have asked the chief executive of Invest Northern Ireland to review the number and breadth of  Invest NI programmes with a view to producing a consolidated suite of offerings  in a business-friendly format that will support the growth of export and  innovation in Northern    Ireland businesses. I have asked Invest NI  to complete the review by June 2010.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The panel also commented on Invest NI export assistance,  suggesting the adoption of a more professional and fee-charging model. Entering  new markets outside Northern    Ireland is an important way for local  businesses to realise their growth potential. I have seen at first hand the  real value that Northern    Ireland companies get when they take part in  market visits, and I am encouraged that Invest Northern Ireland is committed to  further developing its export assistance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Obviously, the merits of the proposal need to be given more  detailed consideration, and, when introducing or revising any fee-changing  structure, we need to be careful to ensure that it does not become prohibitive.  However, I am aware that Invest NI has already carried out some work in this  area and will be bringing forward new proposals in March 2010 for the next  financial year.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, the Department had already planned to evaluate  Invest NI&rsquo;s export assistance. Work is due to be completed towards the end of  2010. Clearly, the implementation group that covers DETI and Invest NI  assistance will need to reflect on the findings of the evaluation when it  becomes available to ensure that we offer the best-quality exporting support to  Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  businesses.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The review panel also made proposals on assistance for  training; financing of businesses; industrial land provision; exploiting  telecommunications infrastructure; and the social economy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The review panel recommended that Invest Northern Ireland  should further reduce its support for company training and concentrate support  mainly to small firms and projects with a high innovative content. Unsurp&shy;risingly,  concern was expressed, principally from business organisations, about the  impact of that recommendation. I understand that evidence that underpins that  recommendation was drawn from an evaluation of the company development  programme, which has been superseded by the business improvement training  programme. That new programme is the subject of an evaluation that is scheduled  for completion by autumn 2010. That will help to inform company training.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As regards financing of businesses, I recognise that  high-growth businesses are a key driver of economic growth, not only because  they develop themselves and generate significant employment growth but because  their dynamism stimulates competition and innovation throughout the economy as  a whole. In many instances, equity funding is the most appropriate type of  financing for such companies. Recent evaluations demonstrate that an equity gap  still persists in Northern    Ireland, particularly covering the seed,  early, and development stages for deals of up to &pound;2 million. Therefore, my view  is that Invest Northern Ireland continues to intervene to support development  of the venture capital market in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Today is not the time to respond in specific detail to the  full list of recommendations. However, my position on all of them and, indeed,  on all the other proposals that are contained in the independent report are set  out in the detailed paper that I have included with my statement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The third area on which the panel made recomm&shy;endations was  autonomy, flexibility and decision-making. The panel&rsquo;s review of global best  practice suggested that successful development agencies benefit from having  freedom to operate in a way that allows them to be entrepreneurial and  responsive to business needs. I fully support that sentiment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Indeed, a key element of the original rationale behind the  establishment of Invest NI in 2002 was the desire to create a development  agency that was more businesslike in its operations. However, a criticism that  is often levelled at DETI and Invest Northern Ireland  is that the governance system remains too complex and time-consuming and that  that impedes Invest Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  responsiveness.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I can indicate to Members that my officials have already  held discussions with the Department of Finance and Personnel (DFP) to explore  how current delegated limits might be extended. I have asked that the relevant  implementation group conclude on that issue as soon as possible. My aim is to  try to establish new departmental governance arrangements by April 2010.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, where major projects require DETI and DFP  approval, I accept the panel&rsquo;s recommendation that those cases should be  considered in parallel by a central project review group. Again, I have asked  that officials from my Department and DFP agree the mechanisms that need to be  established for that group to be operational from April 2010.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The panel&rsquo;s report also contains a number of  recommendations that relate to the organisation of Invest Northern Ireland. In  accepting the principle of greater autonomy, those are, for the most part,  internal issues for the agency to consider. I have asked Invest NI&rsquo;s chief  executive to reflect on those recommendations and to advise the implementation  group of any steps that he plans to take. That will cover areas such as the  structure of Invest NI and training of its staff.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, with regard to decision-making, the independent  report recommended that all ex post assessments of value for money should be  taken on a portfolio basis. I support that strongly. My long-held view is that  we must manage risk better. However, in doing so, we cannot afford to be  risk-averse. I have asked the permanent secretary in my Department to engage with  DFP and the Northern Ireland Audit Office to explore how best that balance can  be struck in practice.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Before I conclude, I turn to the independent panel&rsquo;s  recommendations on the roles of DETI and Invest NI in policy development and  performance monitoring. I agree that it is right that the Department have lead  responsibility for policy development and performance monitoring and that it is  important to have appropriate resources in place to deliver that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The permanent secretary has begun to review the DETI structures,  and I have asked him to look for ways to strengthen the Department&rsquo;s policy  analysis and development function. The panel also recommended that DETI should  assume responsibility for reporting on Invest NI&rsquo;s performance, and I can  confirm that that will be the case for the next Invest NI performance report,  which will be published at the end of the current corporate plan period. I can  also confirm that Invest NI&rsquo;s operating plan for 2010-11 will include targets  specifically for investments new to Northern Ireland, as per the  panel&rsquo;s recommendation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also agree that it is important that my senior officials  and I have access to top quality and timely economic and business advice. The  panel has made a number of recommendations in that regard, particularly in  relation to the future of the Economic Development Forum (EDF).</p>
    <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Since its establishment in 1999, the forum has played a  very important role in advising on the direction of economic development in Northern Ireland.  During my tenure as chairperson, I have found the engagement with members to be  beneficial. Of particular benefit is the work that has been undertaken by the  forum&rsquo;s subgroups on various issues, including recent work on such areas as the  economic downturn, manufacturing and exports. However, as Members will be  aware, the review panel suggested that the current mechanism for the delivery  of independent economic advice, through the EDF, was not optimal. A  recommendation was made to stand down the forum and replace it with a new,  smaller advisory unit, comprising representatives from the business and  economics sectors. In making that recommendation, the panel also stressed the  importance of continuing to engage with stakeholders on a bilateral basis.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have given those recommendations very serious  consideration, and I believe that the time is right to change the way in which  I receive independent advice on the economy. I have, therefore, written to EDF  members advising them that the forum will be stood down and replaced with a new  advisory unit, which is to be established by April 2010. That unit will include  representatives from Invest NI and the business, skills and economics sectors.  The unit will also address a further recommendation that was made by the panel,  namely the appointment of an independent economic adviser. I will continue to  meet with stakeholders on the economy, bilaterally, as and when necessary.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I have set out my position on the  independent report and the steps that I plan to take to promote economic  development in Northern    Ireland. There is no doubting the fact that  the challenges are even greater now, given the impact of the recession on the Northern Ireland  economy. Invest Northern    Ireland uses the appropriate phrase,  &ldquo;Building locally, competing globally&rdquo;. The course that I have outlined today  will help Invest NI continue to do that in order to strengthen our competitive  position &mdash; regionally and globally.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment (Mr A Maginness)</strong>: I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s detailed  statement on Professor Barnett&rsquo;s report. The Enterprise, Trade and Investment Committee,  in general terms, supports the Minister&rsquo;s position. I particularly welcome two  things. First, I welcome her intention to set up an implementation group. I  hope that that group will produce an operational plan as soon as possible so  that the report can be implemented as quickly as possible. Secondly, I welcome  the Minister&rsquo;s intention to pursue the establishment of an Executive  subcommittee for economic policy, which is important in light of our present  economic difficulties.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, may I say that  Invest Northern Ireland should be given as much freedom as it can to get on  with the job of regenerating our economy? I believe that the Minister is  dedicated to that. Will the Minister assure the House that she will do all that  she can to bring about a more flexible, robust and independent Invest Northern Ireland to deal  with the specific difficulties of our economy and the development of a robust  and worthwhile economy in the future?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: I thank the  Chairperson for his comments and for highlighting the implementation group, the  Executive subcommittee and the issue of more flexibility for Invest Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to make the purpose of the implementation group very  clear. Along with my statement, Members will have received my responses to each  of the recommendations. The recommendations have all been answered with regard  to whether we agree or disagree with them, and we disagree with a very small proportion,  as we agree with most of Professor Barnett&rsquo;s report. However, I recognise that  some proposals will take longer to implement than others. Therefore, to ensure  that they are implemented in a timely fashion, I felt that there was a need for  the implementation group, which will report to me directly, and I can ask it  how the implementation is going. The Member is right to point out the  importance of the implementation group in ensuring that we do not lose the  momentum of what we have achieved so far with regard to the Barnett report.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive subcommittee is also a key factor. If the  current recession teaches us anything, it teaches us that it is felt right  across Government and not just in one Department. If we develop an economic  strategy in that way, we will get buy-in from the other Departments, and it  will not be seen as being in a departmental silo, as it never should have been  in the first place.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">More flexibility for Invest Northern Ireland is also  a key factor. Invest Northern Ireland was set up in 2002 with the aim of being  flexible, so that it could meet the needs of business in a more meaningful way  than that which Government could achieve directly. This approach is a way of  doing that, and it will allow Invest Northern Ireland to become even more  flexible and fleet of foot. There is a need to get answers quickly in today&rsquo;s  business world.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise that we are dealing with public money and,  therefore, we have to strike a balance between having the flexibility that I  want for Invest Northern Ireland  and, at the same time, taking account of the use of the large amounts of money  that the Government instruct us to look after. There has been ongoing good  engagement with the Department of Finance and Personnel, and we will be able to  deal with that issue quickly. By April this year, those issues should be dealt  with, and we will then be able to move forward.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  I warmly welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. It is unfortunate that a significant  section of the press draws massive attention to an issue over which we do not  currently have any control, while matters such as this, over which we do have  control and which could make a significant difference to the wider population,  do not attract the same attention.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has outlined comprehensively her suggestions  for a new Department of the economy that would be sufficiently flexible to  offer the skills training that is needed in the downturn &mdash; a need that we have  seen, unfortunately, in some of our constituencies, for example, in Limavady,  where 1,000 people lost their jobs in one go &mdash; and the flexibility of  introducing help and assistance for the small-business sector in times of  recovery. What would be the dramatic difference between any new Department of  the economy and what we have at present?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: It is fair to say the Department for Learning and Employment  (DEL), DETI and Invest NI are working well together. However, a new Department  would allow us to align our policies more closely and to take action quickly  when necessary. Although I have put in place various measures to help to deal  with the current economic downturn, such as the credit-crunch seminars or the  short-term assistance scheme, Sir Reg Empey introduced a programme for skills,  and those two schemes would have had more of an impact had we been able to wrap  them together and deliver them from one Department. Moving forward and having a  single Department of the economy would send out a clear message to other  Administrations that we see the economy at the top of the Programme for  Government and that we want to drive it ahead.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. F&aacute;ilt&iacute;m roimh r&aacute;iteas an Aire. I  also welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement to the House today. My two questions  follow on from what Gregory Campbell said about reassuring the business  community. A potential merger between the Minister&rsquo;s Department and the  Department for Employment and Leaning was mentioned. In the interim, will the  Minister ensure that economic policy is kept in line and that it will go hand  in hand with a skills and training strategy to meet the future needs of  businesses?</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Invest NI has accepted the need for performance measures,  but there does not seem to be much evidence that it is an ongoing feature of  its work. At the end of her statement to the House, the Minister said that her  Department would take on that responsibility, but will Invest NI continue to  analyse performance measures and assess how far it has gone in attracting  business? Go raibh maith agat.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: The answer to the Member&rsquo;s last question is yes, absolutely. In  my statement, I said that specific targets will be included in the new  operating plan for Invest Northern Ireland. That will allow the  Department to determine whether those targets have been met, and it will help  to counter some of the allegations that are made against Invest Northern Ireland, which  bear no relation to what I see on the ground. As my Department does not  currently have such a responsibility, it is unable to produce a report. That  change will add significantly to future transparency and openness.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the interim, and as I said in response to a question  from the Chairperson of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, the  subcommittee on the economy will be crucial in tying up the skills agenda with  my Department&rsquo;s agenda. All large companies, whether indigenous or new foreign  companies, want to be assured that the appropriate skills base is available  here for any business expansion they wish to take forward. To my knowledge, to  date no company has been unable to expand or invest in Northern Ireland  because of a lack of appropriate skills, and we must ensure that that continues  to be the case.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: I  also thank the Minister for her thorough and detailed statement to the House. I  have two questions, the first of which relates to the proposed phasing out of  support for business expansion. Will that action place Northern Ireland  at a competitive disadvantage in attempting to attract inward investment and be  to the detriment of future growth?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, businesses and trade unions disagreed with the  panel&rsquo;s view that high energy costs have been addressed, and they suggested  that more action is needed to bring down relative energy prices in Northern Ireland.  Does the Minister share that view?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: Conflicting evidence was heard on financial assistance.  Professor Barnett felt that there was a need to move away from that quite  quickly and to support research and development and innovation instead.  However, in his original report to me he stated that:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the severity of the ongoing recession highlights an  important policy consideration, namely that financial assistance to industry  will vary depending on the economic cycle.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We must take into account the short-term difficulties that  we face and retain all of the tools, including selective financial assistance,  that are available to us. Why should we throw away that tool when other regions  of the United Kingdom  are retaining it? I understand the panel&rsquo;s point about research and  development, and we are keen to move into that area in the medium to longer  term. In the shorter term, however, DETI and Invest Northern Ireland must  take cognisance of the fact that we are in the midst of an economic downturn.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As a member of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, the Member  will also be aware that money has already been indicatively offered for 2010-11  and that the financial assistance that has already been offered to companies  cannot be removed simply to satisfy the report. The retention of selective  financial assistance (SFA) is the right way to proceed in the shorter term. It  will be up to the implementation group to consider whether SFA should be used  in the future when, for example, companies offer jobs of higher value. There is  a lot of work to be carried out in that area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to the Member&rsquo;s second point about high energy  costs, regrettably, a lot of large business users have seen an increase in  their energy bills, particularly over the last couple of months. The Member  will be aware that the Utility Regulator is carrying out a review into energy  costs. I met the regulator briefly just last week to establish how that review  is going, and at that meeting it was indicated that all the energy companies  have been working very closely with the regulator and that the review is being  carried out as expeditiously as possible. I know that the cost of energy is a  big worry for a lot of large firms here, and the Member has my commitment that  we will do everything that we can to deal with those issues.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her statement and for the speed with which she and her  Department dealt with Professor Barnett&rsquo;s report. That report states that  Invest Northern Ireland should concentrate more on small firms and projects  with high innovative content. Does the Minister believe that the small business  unit that she proposes to establish will deal with that?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In her speech the Minister said that the new economic  strategy will form the heart of the next Programme for Government. Surely  something can be done within the present Programme for Government to deal with  the issues that have been raised.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment: The Member will know that a lot of small businesses have  for many years expressed the opinion that Invest Northern Ireland was not for  them. Today, I have tried to highlight the fact that Invest NI actually did  work with small businesses &mdash;<em> [Interruption.]</em></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: However, there is a need to be more focused in helping our  small businesses. The Member will know that our economy overwhelmingly consists  of small and micro businesses.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I looked closely at what had happened in the aerospace  industry. I know that it is a very specific sector, but that sector has been  able to operate with a supply chain that works, involving companies such as  Bombardier right down to small precision engineering companies that may have a  couple of people working for them. Instead of having a large business unit and  a small business unit, I want to see an integrated approach to business right  across Northern Ireland, so that businesses in a particular sector can work  through that sector without being labelled as a small business and not really  being an Invest NI client. It is right to move away from Invest NI client  status to a more integrated approach for small businesses.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to the Member&rsquo;s second point, I referred to the  economic strategy forming part of our Programme for Government in the next  term. It is absolutely key that we do that, but I hope that the Member can take  from the rest of today&rsquo;s statement that I do not want to sit around and wait  until then to move the economy forward. I have set out a number of ways that we  can move forward quickly. I hope that the delegated limits and all the  initiatives to make Invest NI more flexible will be in place by April 2010.  Programmes have already been rationalised; I think immediately of the grant for  R&amp;D and the way in which it rationalised all the research and development  programmes. A lot of practical work will happen before then, but I do realise  that money has been committed for 2010-11. We are setting the economic strategy  for the medium to longer term while dealing with the short-term challenges that  are before us now in the most effective way that we can.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Moutray</strong>:  Like others, I welcome the fact that the Minister has brought this important  and timely statement to the House so speedily. Will the Minister indicate  whether the role of the Invest NI board will change as a result of her  statement?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: The members of the Invest NI board have worked very well  together. The board provides a good challenge to the work of Invest NI and its  chief executive. It has always fulfilled an important role in the work of  Invest NI; for example, it sits on the case-work committees and helps to fulfil  a challenge role. However, the precise role and remit of the board will be  reviewed in the context of dealing with the revision of delegated limits. I  have already said that I hope that that piece of work will be completed by  April 2010.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, a slight change may be made to the role of the  Invest Northern Ireland board. I thank the people who sit on the Invest  Northern Ireland board, many of whom run successful businesses. They give much  of their time and energy to Invest Northern Ireland. I pay tribute to the  public service that they contribute to Northern Ireland, and I hope that  they continue to provide that service.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her statement. She said that today is not the day for  her to respond to questions on specific details in the recommendations.  However, I am disappointed that, when she mentioned that the report says that  there is no evidence of resources having been wasted, she did not take the  opportunity to demonstrate that the political will exists to develop and grow  the social economy sector and to recognise the contribution of that sector to  the economy and to the creation of employment in areas of disadvantage and  need. Will the Minister recommend that adequate financial investment be given  to the social economy sector to enable it to develop and grow?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: The Member has asked  me questions about the social economy before, and it is important to recognise  the role that that sector plays in Northern Ireland. When many other  parts of the economy were not growing, the social economy grew, and I  appreciate the work that is carried out in the sector.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I take issue with the Member&rsquo;s mention of money being  wasted. The report recognises that Invest Northern Ireland has made a  significant contribution to economic growth and growth in employment in Northern Ireland.  At the time of the Barnett report&rsquo;s publication, scare stories, hype and noise  were going around about money that had been wasted. The evidence of that is  simply not there, and I urge people to reread the Barnett report on that issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member mentioned the need to deal with regional  disparity. I asked that the report address that issue, and it does so. It says  that companies should be allowed the scope to locate where they can operate most  profitably. For external investors with increasingly tradable services, that  means &mdash; unfortunately for me and my constituency &mdash; locating in large urban  areas. I urge people to look at what the report has tried to do; it has tried  to bring a step change to the Northern    Ireland economy. That is what it is about,  and it provides a good basis for moving forward.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I will resist the temptation to engage in a discussion on the impact that  regional disparity has on the Strangford constituency. The Minister talked  about a consolidated suite of programmes. Can she outline what those programmes  might be and any rationalisation that has taken place already?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: I have already referred to the fact that Invest Northern  Ireland has looked at its suite of programmes and decided to rationalise in the  research and development field. In December 2008, I launched the grant for  R&amp;D, which brought together all of the R&amp;D and innovation programmes  and allowed a single application to take place. That allows companies not to  waste time giving consideration to what is the most appropriate programme for  them to apply to but allows them to apply and get through the process more  quickly. Business groups have told me that they found that that worked well,  and they hoped that that would happen with other Invest NI programmes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McFarland</strong>:  I thank the Minister for the report and for her courage in pushing through  much-needed reform to our economic policy. Many local authorities have  expressed concern that Invest Northern Ireland has bought up property in prime  locations that has not then been used and is denied to other businesses. Is the  Minister minded to review Invest Northern Ireland&rsquo;s operation of its property  strategy?</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">1.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: I accept what the Member said. Paragraph 3.29 of the analysis  of responses to the consultation exercise states that:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Many local councils expressed their concern that  Invest NI had purchased property in prime locations to hold for clients, which  has then remained vacant and prevented other businesses from using the land.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I presume that that is what the Member was  referring to. However, contrary to that, a number of councils indicated that  they would like Invest Northern Ireland  to purchase more land as a means of attracting investment to their areas.  Therefore, there are conflicting views on that issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to look at our land acquisition strategy.  The Member is right about that. An evaluation of Land and Property Services is  under way, and I am due to receive a report on that in spring 2010. I hope that  that means March 2010 as opposed to later in spring 2010 &mdash; I think that it  does. That report will then go to the implementation group to take the matter  forward. As I said, there are conflicting messages about the land acquisition  strategy, and clarification is required.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her extensive reply to the report on the independent  review of economic policy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although it may not have been specifically mentioned in the  report, the Minister mentioned some fairly radical changes, including a closer  relationship between DETI and DEL. However, it strikes me &mdash; we have discussed  this before &mdash; that the missing link is a functioning postgraduate business  school in Belfast  that would embrace components of the universities. Has the Minister considered  that as part of the radical restructuring, or has it been put on the long  finger?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. It is not a matter of me  putting it on the long finger. The Member is right that that specific issue was  not addressed in the Barnett report. The review was, from a strategic point of  view, more about considering the need for a Department of the economy. At  present, such issues reside with my Executive colleague Sir Reg Empey and are  to do with the skills and training agendas. However, I am happy to pass on the  Member&rsquo;s comments to my colleague and, indeed, have a discussion with him about  that issue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her statement. I know that many businesses across Northern Ireland  will support the establishment of a Department of the economy. Will Invest  Northern Ireland  continue to offer financial support to relatively low-paid tradable service  projects, including call centres?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: The key to all this is that Barnett was considering selective  financial assistance in the medium to longer term. I made that clear today. I  said that there was a push and a pull factor. There is a need to do that  because we want to progress Northern    Ireland through research and development. I  nearly said Vorsprung durch Technik; I was thinking of that old Audi ad.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At the other end of the scale, Europe  is looking at us and saying that regional aid may come to an end in 2013.  Therefore, there is a need to consider the whole issue of selective financial  assistance. However, given that we are in the midst of a recession, in the  shorter term, we need all the tools that are available to us. Therefore, given  the present circumstances, I firmly believe that selective financial assistance  should remain available to us.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A lot of FDI companies come to Northern Ireland and  initially place perhaps 15 to 20 employees here, do some research and  development and, by doing so, attain Invest Northern Ireland&rsquo;s support. However,  75% of those companies then invest for a second time, and they grow what they  have in Northern Ireland.  It would be a retrograde step if we were not able to assist such firms with  greater expansion in Northern    Ireland. It would be detrimental to the  economy. Therefore, I firmly believe that we may need to keep SFA available to  us in the short term.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  commend the Minister for what she is trying to do. I agree with her that  simplistic criticisms about wasted millions or billions do not make any useful  contribution to improvement. The amalgamation of DEL and DETI is an interesting proposal.  That would be a major change, the full implications of which would have to be  thought through, including how it might be done.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister reconcile the need for innovation and  sharp focus in the support systems for business with her very complex  statement, which included a large number of specific initiatives? We want to  encourage innovation and sharp focus in the business community. If they are not  present in the support mechanisms, they will not be encouraged in that  community.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: I am not sure that I follow the Member. Is he asking whether  there is a need to rationalise Invest NI programmes? That is certainly what we  will do. I have asked the chief executive to bring forward that review to the  date specified in my statement; I cannot recall that date just now. There is a  pressing need to crunch down on the myriad of programmes available. It is too  much to expect managers of small businesses to go through them all and see  which ones apply to them. If the Member is asking whether I am talking about  rationalisation, the answer is that I am.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her lengthy statement, which lasted 40 minutes. At one  stage, I was going to pass her my throat lozenges to help massage and soothe  her throat.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are clearly in an economic recession &mdash; I hate to use  those words &mdash; and jobs are being lost. Will the Minister confirm that it is  right to continue to focus on improving productivity?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: I thank the Member for his ex post facto sympathy. I did not  see any sweets coming forward as I read my statement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is right that we continue to focus on productivity,  particularly in the medium-to-longer term. If we want to produce a step change  in Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  economy, we must focus on it. However, Barnett and his colleagues on the review  team recognised that there was a need to take the current economic cycle into  account, and I have already referred to that in comments addressed to another  Member. We must recognise where we are at the moment. Everything I have said  about selective financial assistance should be understood in that context, and  I know that the Member appreciates that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McHugh</strong>:  Thank you, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Almost every aspect of the Minister&rsquo;s statement has been  covered, but there was a lot in it. I welcome the statement and the Minister&rsquo;s  intent to look at Invest NI&rsquo;s delivery and try to leave us in a more  competitive situation worldwide. It is important that industries become more  R&amp;D-focused to allow us to stay in the high salary bracket. We have to  approach the problem from that angle.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My question has a local focus, and the Minister is aware of  my position. We are moving forward to a new position and taking the new  approach of R&amp;D and innovation. Will the new Department reposition, and  will mindsets change? All the innovations may take place, but it seems from all  the Minister&rsquo;s answers that the Department is still adopting a Belfast-only position.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: I do not know how the Member infers that we have a Belfast-only  position. No one can accuse me of looking solely at Belfast in anything that is done in relation  to DETI&rsquo;s policies. The Member knows that only too well, as Fermanagh will be  the recipient of much telecommunications infrastructure in the near future.  Advancing innovation and research and development can help any number of firms,  regardless of location or size. With our excellent and growing  telecommunications infrastructure, I envisage that many firms across the  country will take advantage of research and development and innovation  assistance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Research and development and innovation are not just about  people wearing white coats; they are about new products, developments and  processes, in whatever sector people work. I urge the Member not to see  bogeymen where none exists and instead to work through the process and grasp  what we are trying to do for the whole economy. Let me be clear: this is about  the whole Northern Ireland  economy, certainly not just about Belfast.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  The Minister has said that there is no waste in Invest Northern Ireland. Does  she draw a distinction between waste and inefficiency, bearing in mind that,  relative to other jurisdictions and compared with other inward investments, our  job creation costs are high? Does she think that opportunity costs will arise  from that?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister also spoke about the importance of dealing  with the current economic cycle. I had hoped that the report would have looked  more to the future by focusing on restructuring the economy. Will the Minister  speculate on how the recommendations will contribute to addressing the  structural difficulties in the economy, which has a high dependency on the  public sector, and the low level of productivity?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: I will answer the last question first. The report is about a  new economic focus for Northern    Ireland by moving forward with higher  productivity. That is why we are examining research and development and  innovation, and it is why we are encouraging more private sector companies to  be export-focused. We have seen many companies become more export-focused out  of necessity over the past 18 months, and we want to support those companies in  moving forward. Many smaller firms have grown from family structures, and they,  therefore, do not have the necessary management structures to move ahead and  make a difference through productivity.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Dr Farry also raised the issue of waste. I understand his  point about additionality and about SFA having a lower additionality for  research and development. However, when I visit different locations around the  country for job opportunities, very few MLAs say to me that they do not want  Invest Northern Ireland  to give those companies assistance because they are providing low-value jobs.  Members have choices to make. If they do not want Invest Northern Ireland to become involved in the so-called call  centre phenomenon, much more work remains to be done to get foreign direct  investment of that nature into Northern Ireland,  because many of the firms that currently come here receive assistance from  Invest Northern Ireland.  Therefore, we have big choices to make about the sort of economy that we want  for Northern Ireland.  For my part, I want an innovative economy that is based on research and  development. I have seen the difference that research and development has made  to the economies of countries such as Israel, and I think that it can do  the same for our economy and do it very well.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as  an tuairisc seo a chur faoi bhr&aacute;id an Tion&oacute;il inniu. T&aacute; ceist agam ar an Aire  faoi fhorbairt eacnama&iacute;och ar bhonn fo-r&eacute;igi&uacute;nach.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister assure the House that future economic  development policy will ensure that subregional disparities will be addressed  through the use of Invest Northern Ireland resources to produce a more  balanced programme of economic growth throughout the North?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: As I said in  response to a question about regional disparity from Ms McCann of West Belfast, I specifically asked the Barnett review  group to consider regional disparity. It has said that companies should be  allowed the scope to locate their premises wherever they feel that they can  operate most profitably. That in itself presents a challenge for MLAs, because  they must consider what they can give to their regions to mark them as out  areas where companies will want to invest.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Through its regional offices, Invest Northern Ireland will  continue to work with all the companies that come to it for assistance. In  fact, given that Invest Northern Ireland&rsquo;s client status will now go into the  history books, many companies have the opportunity to move forward in  partnership with Invest Northern Ireland and put themselves on the  map, whether it be in research and development and innovation or in new export  markets.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her lengthy statement. Paragraph 90 states that the  permanent secretary will engage with the Audit Office to present a balanced way  forward. Will the Minister assure us that the independence of the Audit Office  will not be undermined in any way and that it will continue to evaluate the  work of all Departments to ensure that taxpayers&rsquo; money is accounted for in  every way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: I am not responsible for the Audit Office, and I think that it  would take unkindly to the suggestion that a conversation with my permanent  secretary would, in some way, damage its independence.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have long said that, if we want Invest Northern Ireland to  manage its risk better, there must be an understanding across the Chamber, the  press and the Audit Office about what we are trying to achieve, and that is the  reason for the engagement between the permanent secretary and the Audit Office.  We are trying to achieve a situation in which that body can act more flexibly  when faced with entrepreneurial business people. However, in doing so, that  body must recognise that it is dealing with public money. That is why I asked  my permanent secretary to have discussions with the Audit Office. I am quite  sure that the Audit Office will remain independent at all times.</p>

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30  minutes for the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes in  which to propose and 10 minutes in which to make a winding-up speech. All other  Members who are called to speak will have five minutes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>: I  beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls on the Minister for Employment and  Learning to bring forward measures to ensure that more students from a  Protestant background are encouraged to opt for universities in Northern  Ireland as their first choice.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The motion concerns what must be one of the most  critical matters for education in our time and, if we fail to act, an issue  that has long-term consequences for Northern Ireland and its economy. I  refer, of course, to the number of Protestant students attending universities  in Northern Ireland.  The issue is not being raised to upset any political party or to attack the  Minister. I hope that the debate will be taken in the spirit in which it is  intended, which is to raise awareness and, hopefully, to address the serious  situation before us.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Such a serious problem in our education system demands an  urgent response from the Minister for Employment and Learning. The motion tells  the Minister of the necessity for a strategic course of action that can  realistically tackle, through a step-by-step approach, the serious imbalance in  the number of Protestant students attending universities in Northern Ireland.  The motion asks the Minister to go beyond a matter-of-fact response, because a  deadpan restatement of the status quo is inadequate to current needs. There is  restlessness in the Protestant community, and we need accountability and real  answers from the Minister on how we are going to tackle the serious problem of  low numbers of Protestant students attending Northern Ireland universities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The challenge for our universities is to look to their figures,  which have alerted us to the fact that Protestant students are not opting for  those institutions as their first choice, and to ask why that is. Set against  the background of the variety of choices that other parts of the United Kingdom offer, we would be pleased to see  Northern Ireland  universities encouraging Protestant students to elect them as their first  choice. Let us take action to make Northern Ireland universities,  which are a valuable resource, the first option and best alternative from what  is available.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Given the scary statistics, which I will present, a valiant  effort is required from the Minister and our universities to address the raw  fact of the low number of Protestant students attending our universities. The  Minister will understand that we have to chivvy him along on that matter. I  will set out evidence detailing the imbalance in the number of Protestant students  and demonstrate to the House why it is necessary to bring forward measures for Northern Ireland  universities to attract more Protestant students.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will lay out the cold, clinical statistics on the state  which we are currently in. For instance, at Queen&rsquo;s University in 2007 and  2008, there were 6,735 people from a Protestant background and 8,245 from the  Roman Catholic community. At the Magee campus of the University of Ulster,  530 students were from the Protestant community, and 2,090 students were from the  Roman Catholic community. At the Belfast campus  of the University   of Ulster, 450 students  were from the Protestant community, and 545 students were from a Roman Catholic  background. At the Jordanstown campus of the University of Ulster,  3,685 students were from the Protestant community, and 6,105 students were from  the Roman Catholic community. At St Mary&rsquo;s University College,  10 students were from a Protestant background, and 910 students were from the  Roman Catholic community. The statistics also show that students from a Roman  Catholic background receive more information on funding than those from the  Protestant community: 69% to 55%.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Equality Commission published an expert paper titled  &lsquo;Educational Migration and Non-Return in Northern Ireland&rsquo;. That paper  highlighted the stark fact that students from the Protestant community are more  likely than their counterparts from the Roman Catholic community to migrate  from Northern Ireland to Great Britain  for higher education and stay without returning. Those are not my words but  words used in the expert report, the findings of which will shock all  right-thinking people.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let me go further and look at the 2005-06 period, in which  some 2,736 school leavers were tracked. A staggering 29% of our students migrated  to Great Britain  in that period, and Protestant school leavers were 11% more likely to migrate  to study in GB than their Roman Catholic counterparts.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although statistics can be dry, the following should excite  and animate the House to action: two thirds of Northern   Ireland school leavers who studied in Great Britain did not return to Northern Ireland  in the short to medium term. An examination of community backgrounds shows the  reality that more Roman Catholics studied in Northern Ireland than Protestants:  77% to 66%.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The picture becomes bleaker still when it is realised that,  in absolute terms, 59% of all school leavers &mdash; 3,852 &mdash; are from a Roman  Catholic background while those from a Protestant background make up 36%. I put  it to the Minister that, despite increasing enrolment to the Northern Ireland  institutions, the proportion of Roman Catholic students to Protestant students  in our universities has not changed for a number of years. When I refer to the  Protestant exodus from our universities, the word &ldquo;exodus&rdquo; refers to the  departure or, as some may rightly say, exit of Protestants from Northern Ireland universities and, indeed, Northern Ireland  in the short to medium term.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The facts that I have outlined speak for themselves and ask  the Minister why Protestant students are retreating from the courses available  in our Northern Ireland  universities. What do we need to do at home to ensure that our Protestant  students do not withdraw and take flight to GB universities? How can we ensure  that they do not refrain from going to university? Having established that  there is a problem, let us apply ourselves in a hopeful way to the measures  that the Minister needs to take to tackle it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Will the Member clarify why, as a self-proclaimed unionist, he views a person  from Northern Ireland who  wishes to study in another part of the United   Kingdom as any more of a problem than someone from London who wishes to study in Newcastle?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  If the Member had been listening properly, he would have heard me say that  people have the right to go to whatever university they want to. I am  complaining about the lack of Protestants attending universities in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">No longer is it acceptable to export our home-grown talent  or not to take measures to encourage attendance at our universities. No longer  will we stand idly by while our society and our economy suffer from a lack of  Protestant students.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I challenge the universities to conduct detailed research  into why Protestant students are looking elsewhere for their education or are  not going to university at all. They should apply their brains and resources to  the problem and produce an action plan on how to address the issue. That action  plan should be able to be audited for success.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the past, Protestant students found the atmosphere at  universities here to be that of a cold house, and that encouraged them to look  elsewhere. Terrorism also played a significant part in that, but thankfully we  have moved on from the evil and ultimate futility of that, so let us try to  ensure that the cold house is a thing of the past.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Research also informs us that teachers are a key influence  in assisting and guiding students on where they undertake their studies. Should  we look to teacher training and see how, as a key influence in providing  guidance, teachers can promote and sell the benefits of what we have here?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will return briefly to the circumstances or, more  accurately, the plight of Stranmillis   University College.  Will the Minister give his detailed attention to Stranmillis and reprioritise  so that its future can be taken into account? That future has a direct  correlation to the future availability of places at an institution that has  attracted high-quality students. Such reprioritisation should involve educating  students here so that society in Northern Ireland can benefit. In  many ways, Stranmillis has bucked the trend and helped to prevent the further  deterioration of the already critical and severe calamity of a Protestant  student exodus. However, even here we see changes, and the proposed merger of  Stranmillis and Queen&rsquo;s may make the situation even worse.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister must address himself to the access and equality  issue. In fact, a significant 14&middot;1% of Protestants acknowledge and have the  limited perception that St Mary&rsquo;s is not welcoming to people from their community,  whereas only 3&middot;1% of the Roman Catholic community perceive that Stranmillis is  not welcoming to them. If the Minister were to adopt an ostrich approach to  Stranmillis&rsquo;s plight by sticking his head in the sand and letting it be, the  Protestant student numbers would only be distressed further. That prospect is  too awful to contemplate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is vital to tackle and stop the discrimination against  Protestants that the Catholic certificate of education causes. The Catholic  Church and the Minister have a duty to end that discrimination against  Protestant student teachers. In order to address the unfair advantage that the  Catholic certificate of education offers, dare I suggest that we do away with  that certificate or create a controlled sector certificate to correct that  imbalance?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The evidence base highlights the quality and quantity of  what we can offer students. We must realise that students are in the  marketplace. Are courses elsewhere in GB more attractive? If so, why? Given  that the Internet has been identified as the key source of information to  potential student applicants, should universities in Northern Ireland use the Internet  more to promote themselves? Should we set targets for our universities so that  the serious imbalance in student numbers can be corrected? Furthermore,  researchers have said that government should do more to encourage Protestant  students to apply and must take action to inform Protestant students of the  financial support that is available to them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The deteriorating situation for Protestants in our  secondary schools compared with their Catholic counterparts merits further  attention and the creation of an adequately resourced action plan. We must  reverse the laissez-faire approach that allows proportionately fewer Protestant  students from secondary education to progress to further education and  university.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have laid out in stark terms the position that we are in.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should bring his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  Nothing less than a robust action plan with built-in criteria is required to  address the serious imbalance in numbers.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The Member who moved the motion  raised a number of issues. I agree on one point: there is a need for an action  plan but not one that is based on this motion. I will elaborate on that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am disappointed that we did not have this debate in  October. At that time, I was interested to hear the Minister&rsquo;s views. In  fairness to the Minister &mdash; I welcome him to the debate &mdash; I had the opportunity  to read his press release, and it is important that we read some of it into the  record. The press release gave a number of figures stating that we are losing  fewer students today than 20 years ago. It also gave a breakdown of Protestant  and Catholic numbers. Moreover, it showed that, in general, it is likely that  more students from a Catholic tradition leave the North to study in the South  or in Britain.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In saying that, I do not want to get into the issue of  Protestant and Catholic numbers. There is a problem with student numbers from  poor, working-class areas and with the number of women students. When talking  about personal choice, we must realise that people choose to study in  universities in Asia, America,  England, Scotland or the  Twenty-six Counties for a number of reasons. We should not, on the one hand,  tell students that the world is their oyster but, on the other hand, criticise  them for studying elsewhere to find the best education. Personal choice must be  taken into consideration. The other reality is that some people do not achieve  the relevant qualifications to study at our top-class institutions here, and  others just want to see a bit of the world.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The research documents that the Member who moved the motion  mentioned are very important.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to note that the Equality Commission&rsquo;s  research showed that more Catholics than Protestants &mdash; 40% and 34% respectively  &mdash; went on to higher education. However, that research also stated:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;This was influenced by a number of factors, including  &hellip; aspirations and culture.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is the key to the issue. We need to examine  that research; that is where the action plan comes in.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">1.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Equality Commission&rsquo;s research also suggested that:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;there may be cultural barriers to continuing in  education facing boys from poorer Protestant communities &hellip; many disadvantaged  Protestant communities were still adjusting to the fact that there were no  longer the same opportunities available to school leavers&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">and</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;that there was less support from parents &hellip; regarding  continuing their education.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That is also a key factor. Fifteen or 20 years ago, boys  from Protestant communities always had a job waiting for them. We must change  the mindset of people from poorer working-class areas. We also need to consider  the gender issue; the percentage of girls going on to university was much  higher than that for boys, and that is before we even consider the numbers of  Catholic girls and Protestant girls. We must tackle that issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am conscious that we should not highlight figures when  the statistics show that they are not true and that the situation has improved  in recent years. I am keen to hear what the Minister says. However, if we are  going to draw up an action plan, let us examine why more women than men and  more people from affluent areas are going on to further and higher education.  Let us ensure that people who want to go on to further and higher education  have equality of opportunity and access.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Alex Easton will have gathered that we will oppose the  motion. It does not make sense, and the figures do not add up. If he is going  to quote research, he must be careful about what comes after it. It is all  right to quote figures, but the research shows that there are issues in  Protestant communities that prevent boys in particular from going on to further  and higher education.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>:  It is important to begin by stating that it is a fundamental right of all  students to choose freely where they go to study. In a liberal democracy, it is  not for the state to dictate where people should study. It is certainly not the  role of a Department to take steps to ensure that students do not leave their  region.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is, of course, for a Government to create the conditions  whereby people do not want to leave, but that is a very different prospect  indeed. The Government should ensure that the quality of education in Northern Ireland  is such that no one who wants to stay is forced to leave. The Government should  also ensure that there are sufficient jobs in a range of sectors and at a range  of levels so that no one is forced to leave for work purposes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Very few students are forced to leave Northern Ireland.  Veterinary medicine is one of the few subjects for which Northern Ireland  cannot cater. However, in virtually the entire spectrum of subjects, Queen&rsquo;s  University and the University of Ulster have the capacity and quality of provision to  cater for any school leaver in Northern    Ireland who wants to stay here. The vast  majority of school leavers who go to the Republic  of Ireland, Great Britain or further afield are  doing so because they are determined to do so. That is their right.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many students leave for lifestyle reasons, simply because  they want a change and the independence that moving away from Northern Ireland  brings. Are we really saying to those people that that option should not be  open to them? We must also remember that there are educational reasons why  people may want to move. Queen&rsquo;s University and the University  of Ulster are excellent institutions,  and in fields such as medicine and law they are among the best in the United Kingdom.  However, universities such as Cambridge, Oxford and Trinity  College Dublin provide a tremendous draw for some of our brightest students;  indeed, some Members have those institutions as their alma mater. Are we really  to close that avenue to our brightest students?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The number of Protestant and Catholic students who leave Northern Ireland  is roughly equal. The brain drain exists to some extent, but the Minister is  addressing that through the &ldquo;Come on Over&rdquo; campaign. However, it is not true to  say that there is a sectarian problem or that it is more of an issue for  Protestants than for anyone else.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We must, therefore, put more effort into making Northern Ireland  an attractive place for business. We must grow the private sector and provide a  wider range of opportunities in Northern    Ireland for our graduates, so that those who  do leave for universities in other places have the opportunity to come back.  That is the real issue, and that is what I want to be addressed.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  In the lead-up to the debate, the SDLP gave careful consideration to any  qualitative or quantitative evidence that would support the motion.  Unfortunately, insufficient evidence exists to enable us to support it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Going by comments made by some unionist representatives to  the media, the motion seems to be predicated on the argument that there is a  chill factor for Protestant students. We are not convinced that that is the  case or that more Protestants migrate than any other group. Our assertion is,  however, that more investment is required to increase the number of student  places here and stop the overall brain drain from Northern Ireland. I will deal with  those three points in turn, starting with the chill factor argument.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As a social democrat, if there was a chill factor for  Protestants or any other group in society, I would be concerned, and my party  and I would demand that action be taken. When I discussed claims about the  chill factor with those in university management, they strenuously made the  point that their organisations are professional, inclusive and diverse. Their  universities are internationally renowned institutions that do not tolerate  sectarianism, and they reject any claim to the contrary. I also met Protestant  students in my constituency and officials from the students&rsquo; union, and they  also reject any such claim.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, I know of no rigorous study that shows that  there is a chill factor. The Osborne study into secondary school leavers found  that only about 2% of respondents felt that they would feel uncomfortable in a  particular institution for religious reasons.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To provide confidence in that regard, and I say this in  good faith to the Member who proposed the motion, I am prepared to request that  Sir Graeme Davies, as part of his review of higher education, include a study  on the question of a chill factor for any group in our universities. I will do  that with the support of the Committee for Employment and Learning and the  Minister&rsquo;s endorsement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I take on board the point made by the Chairperson of the  Committee for Employment and Learning about the attitude of young men differing  from their female counterparts. There are several reasons for the migration of  students and the historical religious imbalance. The University of Ulster&rsquo;s  seven-year review states:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Those who obtained their university education  elsewhere may be broadly divided into two groups of roughly equal size.  Firstly, there were the so-called &lsquo;determined leavers`: in the main they had  very good A-level results, came from the larger Protestant grammar schools and  from better-off families, and proceeded to the older universities in Scotland  and northern England. The second group were commonly characterised as  &lsquo;reluctant leavers&rsquo;: they had lower A-level results, were evenly divided  between the two communities in Northern Ireland, and tended to go to the  post-1992 universities in Britain. A key factor in regard to this second group  was that the points scores required for entry to the University of Ulster  (And Queen&rsquo;s) were significantly higher than those required by comparable  institutions. The net outcome of the situation was that most emigrants were  Protestants and that both universities in Northern Ireland had a clear  majority of Catholic students.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On the second point, I would like to deal with the  migration figures. In October 2009, the Minister for Employment and Learning,  Sir Reg Empey, said that:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The total numbers of school leavers from Protestant  and Catholic communities leaving to study in Great Britain are very similar. In  2006-07 there were 1,137 Protestant and 1,105 Catholic school leavers and in  2007-08 there were 1,142 Protestant and 1,060 Catholic school leavers choosing  to study at GB universities. If we examine the total number of Northern Ireland domiciled students studying in Republic of Ireland  and Great Britain, it is  likely that there are now more students from a Catholic background, rather than  a Protestant background, choosing to study outside Northern Ireland.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A fair analysis of the studies from which I have quoted and  other studies would be that Protestants from higher-income backgrounds and  grammar schools choose universities in Britain because they see it as a  matter of aspiration and perceived quality. They also see Britain and Scotland in particular as natural  places to move to.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member bring his remarks to a close?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  Catholics are more likely to opt to go to universities in Northern Ireland.  We should not suggest that students should not opt for universities outside Northern Ireland.  It is a personal and family choice.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: The  Alliance Party opposes the motion. We believe that it has a sectarian undertone  that we cannot support. All our young people, regardless of community  background or social class, should be encouraged to go to further or higher  education colleges to reach their full educational potential here or elsewhere  if they so wish. However, we acknowledge the need to enable Protestant working  class pupils to achieve better in school.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We do not believe that the motion stands up to scrutiny.  The figures, which some Members have quoted, speak for themselves. The total  number of school leavers from the two major sections of our community who go to  study in Great Britain  are very similar. In 2007-08, 1,142 Protestant compared with 1,060 Catholic  school leavers chose to leave to study in Great Britain. There is very little  difference. As Sue Ramsey said, if one were to add to those figures the number  of students going to the Republic of Ireland to study, it is likely that there are now  more young people from a Catholic rather than a Protestant background leaving Northern Ireland  to study elsewhere.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion also mentions choice. It is a matter of personal  choice for the undergraduate to select the university in which they want to  study, depending on that institution&rsquo;s reputation. We in Northern Ireland  produce a large number of high flyers each year who achieve outstanding results  at GCSE and A-level. There is nothing wrong with their wanting to choose the  top universities in the UK  or the Republic   of Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although our home-grown universities offer quality  teaching, Queen&rsquo;s University ranked only forty-second in the &lsquo;Sunday Times&rsquo;  university league table, and the University   of Ulster was a few  places behind at fifty-fith place. One may argue the merits of such tables, but  teachers and parents take notice of them. If your son or daughter finds  themselves armed with four A grades at A-levels, should they not aspire to spend  three or more wonderful years at Oxford, Cambridge, University   of London or other  institutions of a similar standing in our neighbouring jurisdictions? I am the  proud mother of two sons who benefited from an excellent education in England, each  attending the top university for their degree course.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Alternatively, those who do not make the grade to go to  Queen&rsquo;s University or the University   of Ulster, which have  only 40,000 places between them, have to go somewhere else. What is the problem  with that? Let us not be so parochial.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: No, I  am sorry.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We should be grateful that our students have so many  options compared with students from other countries. After all, it is not a bad  thing for a young person to leave Northern Ireland to live in  societies that are more tolerant, diverse and progressive than ours. It will  open their minds.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">1.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We need to make Northern Ireland an attractive place that  will entice people back once they have graduated. We need to be able to offer  them a shared and better future in a place where there are job opportunities  and where they can enjoy a quality lifestyle, free from instability, bigotry,  segregation and division. I still hope that my two sons will return some day.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: I  support the motion, and I look forward to addressing the issues that it raises.  Although I agree fully with the argument about choice, we cannot ignore the  fact that two thirds of students who leave Northern Ireland do not return in  the short to medium term. Three quarters of those who choose to study at higher  education institutions on the mainland are Protestants, whereas more Catholics  opt to say in Northern    Ireland. There is no getting away from the  religious imbalance in the make-up of the student populations at both Queen&rsquo;s  University and the University   of Ulster, where I  studied.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is vital that we try to retain students in Northern Ireland,  not only for our education system. Something is driving Protestants away from  universities in Northern    Ireland. We can stick our heads in the sand  and ignore that issue if we want to. Indeed, I get the distinct feeling that  that is what is going to happen today. However, there is a religious imbalance.  There is a lot of talk about equality in the Chamber, but where is the equality  of choice for students here today, especially those from a Protestant or  unionist background? Are those students really welcome in universities in Northern Ireland?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is a long time since I was at university; it is 25  years, in fact. However, I know from my own experience that it was a cold house  for anyone from a unionist background. The year before I started studying at  Jordanstown &mdash; it later became the University   of Ulster &mdash; members of  our security forces were murdered in the vicinity. Unionists did not raise  their heads above the parapet; if they did, they would have had them shot off,  literally.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with other Members, including the Minister, who  said that things have moved on politically and socially since that period.  However, we need to address certain issues to correct the religious and  political imbalance in the numbers who attend Northern Ireland universities. What  is driving students away? What makes them more willing to go to the mainland?  Is it all down to choice? Why do more unionists, or pro-British people, choose  to go to universities in England,  Scotland or Wales, or, as was mentioned, to the very good  universities in Dublin?  I suggest that there is more to it than choice.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Students have approached me to point out the imbalance in  the teaching in our universities. For example, why has there been a long series  of lectures on history from a nationalist perspective at Queen&rsquo;s? Why was the  system not balanced to reflect the unionist tradition in Northern Ireland?  It is divisive that not one of that series of ten history lectures at Queen&rsquo;s  reflected the unionist background. It creates the impression that students from  a Protestant or unionist background are not wanted at that university and that  their history does not count. We need to address the culture that has developed  in our universities. I appeal to the Minister to examine those issues to see  what is making our universities cold houses for Protestants and unionists.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Leonard</strong>:  Does the Member accept that he is possibly accusing some very professional  people of creating an imbalance? Unionist advisers have taught in universities  and continue to do so. There have been examples of university lecturers saying  that collusion should not be talked about because it did not exist. Does the  Member realise that there are two sides to the argument, and that he may well  be engaging in quite a lot of professional negativism?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member has an extra minute in which to speak.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: I  find the comments from our friend about collusion interesting. I was taught  Irish history at school from a nationalist and a unionist background. The  choice of what one believed was left up to the individual. I suggest that that  is part of the problem in our universities. Students are given a one-sided  story and one opinion. The opinions of people from a unionist background do not  seem to count any longer. Until those issues are addressed, there is nothing to  attract Protestants and unionists to our universities in Northern Ireland.  Unfortunately, the religious imbalance in our universities in Northern Ireland  will continue to grow.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should draw his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: I  support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>:  It is unfortunate that the motion asks the Minister to take measures to attract  students of one particular background. The motion reflects more the state of  unionism rather than what the Minister can do. There is no question about it:  we live in a divided society. Our kids are educated separately in primary and  post-primary schools. When the University  of Ulster was created, it was located  in Coleraine rather than Derry. We had all  sorts of problems at Queen&rsquo;s University with the flying of the Union Jack, the  anthem and fair employment. Even the very backgrounds of our universities ran  along religious and political lines.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I think that one of the Minister&rsquo;s statements referred to  the piece of research that was done by Professor Osborne. The issue of why the  majority of students at the University   of Ulster and Queen&rsquo;s  University are Catholic is much more complex than the DUP is trying to portray  it as today. David McClarty touched on the issue of determined leavers, who are  probably from more middle-class, Protestant backgrounds. They choose to go to  places like Scotland and the  north of England  because they think that they will receive a better education. The reluctant  leavers go to universities elsewhere because of the grades and standards that  are sought here.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If we look at more of Professor Osborne&rsquo;s research, we see  that in maintained schools &mdash; this is not Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s argument &mdash; there seems to  be much more provision for, and focus on, kids going into further education.  There is better post-16 provision than there is in the controlled sector. It is  not the fault of the universities that the majority of students in both universities  are Catholic; there are much deeper problems with which we have to deal. I  recognise that Protestant underachievement in the Belfast  area, for example, is far worse than it is in somewhere like Glasgow. There are also other factors. A lot  of Protestant kids would have looked to the traditional manufacturing firms,  such as the shipyard and Mackie&rsquo;s, for employment. There is a changing economic  situation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The last time that this motion was due to be put to the  House, Sinn F&eacute;in tried to table an amendment that called on the Minister to  bring forward proposals to encourage students from all backgrounds to take up  further or higher education in both of our universities. However, the amendment  was rejected.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am uncomfortable about the unfair language used by the  DUP about both our universities. I understand that in the past there were  issues around the Irish language and republicanism. However, that is unfair  today. If asked, the students&rsquo; union would confirm that people of any  background &mdash; Protestant, unionist and republican included &mdash; can set up any  society that they want. Both the University   of Ulster and Queen&rsquo;s  deliver activities and courses in a neutral environment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The most recent evidence quoted by the Minister is that we  are losing students from both Protestant and Catholic backgrounds. It is not a  question of from one or the other. Some issues must be separated to assess  whether our further and higher education sectors are becoming sectarianised. We  must look at how to deal with the underachievement of Protestants, particularly  in the controlled sector in Belfast.  The motion is presented in a way that tries to claim that somehow there is discrimination  in further and higher education against Protestant students. I totally reject  that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Politically, we must try to ensure that the Assembly works,  and that we can share power. That sends a message to people that there is a  future here.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:  The Member must bring his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>: I  believe that many students in the Protestant community are registering a vote  of no confidence in the political dispensation. We have to reject the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Irwin</strong>: I  thank my colleagues for bringing this important issue to the Floor of the  Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The &lsquo;Educational Migration and Non-Return in Northern Ireland&rsquo; report states clearly that  students from a Protestant community background are more likely that those from  a Catholic background to pursue higher education in mainland Britain. It  also concluded that:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Around two-thirds of Northern   Ireland students who studied in Great Britain do not return to Northern Ireland  in the short-to-medium term.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Those two conclusions present their own problems  for our learning and employment sectors. I believe that, as the motion states,  measures should be brought forward to try to reverse that trend, and, in so  doing, to increase our graduate base and stem the brain drain about which we  have recently heard so much.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The wide-reaching effects on Northern Ireland of non-return and  educational migration have already been stated. Many speeches have been made in  the Chamber on the brain drain. Our bright young graduates are not choosing to  return to Northern Ireland.  The fact that one section of the community seems to be most affected by student  migration and non-return should strengthen our resolve to try to address the  11% difference between Catholics and Protestants, as publicised by the Equality  Commission.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In looking at some of the reasons for the situation, the  research paper lists possibilities such as personal choice, aspirations,  widening access to places and competition for places in local universities.  Although we cannot and will not demand that students remain in Northern Ireland to study, the Minister can look  at reasons for educational migration and non-return, and make some improvements  to our higher education system to encourage students to study, and then seek  work, in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is stiff competition for further and higher education  places here. The report mentions that the Department for Employment and  Learning (DEL) has made available some 600 additional places in the further  education sector, which, at the time of the report&rsquo;s publication, had not been  filled. I am keen to know how that situation stands a year on.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The common perception may be that affluence plays a large  part in a student&rsquo;s decision to study outside Northern Ireland. Although the  report lists affluence as a cause, it is not the sole driving factor behind a  student&rsquo;s decision. The courses and degrees that students choose to pursue  shape their lives, but the report makes clear that where they study also has an  influence on where they gain employment. We must look carefully at the reasons  for educational migration. The Department must do more to improve the situation  for our students, with the emphasis on those from a Protestant background, to  ensure that Northern Ireland  has the graduates to sustain its economy in the longer term. I support the  motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert  Coulter</strong>: I am concerned by the motion&rsquo;s overtones.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">First, I believe that it strikes at the very heart  of what we call democracy. I have said before and I make no apology for stating  again that it would be wrong for the Assembly to interfere with the human  rights of young people who apply to universities or higher education  institutions throughout the United Kingdom,  especially since we are part of the United Kingdom. One&rsquo;s right to  freedom of movement and to choose where one completes one&rsquo;s education are part  and parcel of the union.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It would be an intolerable and unsupportable situation if  we sought to influence students from a Protestant background to opt merely for  the two local universities, rather than universities in other parts of the United Kingdom.  We must remember that the United    Kingdom is our country, and such measures  would restrict and inhibit Protestant students&rsquo; freedom of action and choice.  At the very least, that is the presumption and thinking behind the motion. If  not, the motion is meaningless. What is it: empty words or an attempt to  restrict the lives and career choices of Protestant students? Any attempt to  restrict the freedom of choice of students and school leavers is simply not supportable.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The other factor that turns me against the motion is that,  in my experience of education &mdash; first in the Republic of Ireland, then in a  university in Northern Ireland and then across the water doing research and  studying law &mdash; not once at any of the institutions in which I studied did  sectarianism ever raise its head. I object to anything that attacks the very  heart of education by bringing sectarianism into it. Education is for the  benefit of individuals, not for any particular denomination or section of  society.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Economic factors play a big part for young teachers who  have gone through university and are applying for a job in our schools. Given  that there are nine applications for every vacancy, is it any wonder that  students who want to go into education look at the overall situation and decide  that the best way to get a job is to go to a university near to where jobs are  available? Economic factors apply no matter where young people are educated.  Nevertheless, even when young people go across the water to study at  universities in other parts of the United Kingdom,  it is great that they are as well educated there as they would have been if  they had gone to a university in Northern Ireland. For those  reasons, I cannot support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  welcome the debate, because it provides me with an opportunity to counter some  of the myths surrounding this issue. The motion is based to some degree on  fact, but the wording of and thoughts behind the motion and the remedies that  have been suggested are not well founded. To the extent that the motion has  some validity, it is not clear whether the Department for Employment and  Learning bears sole responsibility. The issue is broadly situated in several  policy areas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is a reality that the proportion of Protestant students  entering higher education who migrate to Great Britain is significantly  higher than that for Catholics: 34% compared to 23%.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>:  Does the Member agree that, rather than generating something positive, today&rsquo;s  motion will send out a very negative message to young prospective Protestant  students considering going to university in Northern Ireland? Rather than  achieving something positive and useful, the motion will do the very opposite.  It is also highly offensive to our two universities, which, year after year,  are on record as addressing problems of equality, including sectarianism.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  agree. Indeed, I was going to make a similar point. I think that the Minister,  when he commented on the motion which was not debated in October, did not  present the full picture. He emphasised the actual numbers, which are roughly  equal, of Catholics and Protestants going to Great Britain, but I think that the  proportions are more important. The proportion of &ldquo;what&rdquo; is also very  important. I quoted the percentages of people entering higher education, but  equally important is the proportion of the age group that is eligible to enter  higher education. I believe that that presents a very different picture, and I  will return to that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Equality Commission, as has been noted, tells us that  around two thirds of students who study in Great Britain do not return in the  short to medium term, but even that simple statement needs to be qualified. Not  enough is really known about the long-term patterns, and it depends very much  on the economic climate pertaining at the time. In fact, one author writing in  the CRC research journal said that, on the basis of stated intentions at aged  16, overall Protestants are more likely to come back if they leave, and there  is very little evidence of the actual returnee figures.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We need to take seriously the research evidence from the  Equality Commission on the actual factors influencing student migration to Great Britain.  Those include personal choice and aspirations; socio-economic status and  affluence; student funding; and the availability of places. There is little or  no evidence that chill factors have an impact on the composition of Queen&rsquo;s  University and the University   of Ulster. It is  important to state and recognise that fact.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is also important not to perpetuate myths around the  issue. That is potentially damaging to the universities, as John Dallat said,  and it might contribute to the problem that the proposers fear. If credit were  given to them, they would be in danger of creating a self-fulfilling prophecy.  However, I hope that that credit will not be given to them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let us analyse what is going on: there is a shortage of  higher education places in Northern    Ireland; the number of places is capped by  the Executive; and 29% of our higher education students leave, and very few  come back. That is a major issue for us. Those who leave Northern Ireland  must be split into two groups: those who want to leave and those who have no  choice but to move. Incidentally, as some Members have pointed out, we should  welcome the opportunity offered for experience outside Northern Ireland.  On the whole, that is very healthy. Because of the scarcity of places, the  grades required are higher than for equivalent courses in many GB universities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Everything that I quote here is from established research. DEL research from 2008  states that Protestants are not getting as good A-level results as Catholics.  There is no difference in the grammar schools, but there is a big difference in  the secondary schools. The Equality Commission&rsquo;s figures confirm that Catholics  are more likely to have the required entry grades: 47% of Catholic school  leavers in 2005-06 had two or more A levels compared to 42% of Protestant  school leavers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is competition for university places, and, as a  result, many young Protestants may have to look across the water to get a  place. Also, there is evidence that, although young Catholics have their eyes  set on university, many young Protestants only look to further education.  Therefore, it is important to identify the problem. Does anything need to be  done, or can anything be done?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Far more Catholics than Protestants are going into higher  education in any case: 40% against 34% in 2005-06. That is a remarkably stark  and serious statistic. Therefore, the real task is to bring up the educational  standards in Protestant secondary schools and to change the culture in  Protestant working-class areas, so that there is a much greater aspiration to  higher levels of education.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We know that our future here is in a knowledge-based  economy, and we need to prepare for that. The party from which the proposer  comes might need to think what can be done to address the real problem as I  have presented it. That might make him and his party consider their education  policies, particularly around the area of academic selection.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I oppose the motion. However, I  listened to Mr Easton and Mr Craig, and I took Mr Easton at his word when he  said that they did not table the motion as a means to get at anyone. He  articulated his party&rsquo;s stance, which is well intentioned, and that is welcome.  If any group faces barriers to accessing higher education, I fully support the  raising of that issue in the Chamber and elsewhere. The debate is about  widening access to higher education.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If, in the past, there were situations and contexts, either  real or perceived, that barred young people or made them feel as though they  were not welcome in higher education institutions, that was, clearly,  unacceptable. However, evidence shows that society has moved on from that  situation, if it existed. If there is migration to Britain by young people who  want to study at universities there, research by Osborne, Smith and Gallagher  supports the view that they go for complex and nuanced reasons, as my colleague  Paul Butler mentioned. One such reason is cost. Certainly, it is difficult for  young people from socially deprived backgrounds to go elsewhere to study. Other  Members have raised that point. Perhaps, work needs to be done on another front  to widen access and remove barriers to higher education.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As regards the chill factor, I refer again to the research  that was carried out by Professor Osborne and others. As part of that research,  a cohort of year-12 pupils were asked whether they were aware of any  determining factors that would bar them from or make them not want to go to a  particular university. Sixty-three per cent said that they were not aware of  any factors that would bar them from or make them feel unwelcome at a  particular university. The range of factors included ethnicity, disability and  religion. Of the cohort, 4% said that there were determining factors. Of that  4%, I believe that 15 pupils said that they would consider religion to be a  factor. That is a very small minority. Those figures came from asking young  people.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members mentioned the Equality Commission&rsquo;s research,  which points out that, although Protestants are more likely to go to higher  education institutions in Britain,  that is possibly a matter of choice for some young people who do not consider  that they will need a grant to study. Many of them considered that they would  simply ask their parents to help them out. However, a young person from a  socially deprived background cannot do that. Those issues must be examined.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to go back to the chill factor.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member draw her remarks to a close?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  I will finish on this point, Mr Deputy Speaker. The Equality Commission has  stated that there is little recent evidence of political chill factors on this  matter.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I look at this matter from a slightly different angle to that of the Member who  has just spoken. The motion was tabled after recent figures showed that three  quarters of Ulster  students who choose further education institutions on the mainland are  Protestants. That is the issue that is before the House. We are asking why that  is the case. On 25 May 2006, the &lsquo;News Letter&rsquo; stated that that phenomenon was  due to the Province&rsquo;s higher fees and student loans. The newspaper stated that  a study that it carried out found that fewer Protestants were applying for any  higher education, and it found that one of the compelling reasons for that was  that students were concerned about getting into debt. Many Members are aware of  that. The fear of debt is deterring some students at secondary schools from  going to university.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Any time that I speak on an issue in the Chamber, I speak  from experiences that I have become aware of in my constituency office; it  comes from the people whom I represent. That is where I am coming from in addressing  this motion. Many boys from Protestant or controlled schools cannot see an  advantage in investing in education, if it means getting into debt. Instead,  they plump for a trade, especially in the construction industry, where there is  a potential to earn big money relatively early in their career. Of course, the  big money in the construction industry is long gone. We hope that it will  return, but that will be some time in the future. Those same fears about debt  were expressed by Roman Catholic male pupils but at significantly lower levels.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This haes men&rsquo;t that less warkin cless bakgroon Protestan  maels hae pit in fer univarsitie wi&rsquo; mony bein a majer kinsarn, en this wus a  real feer whun univarsitie fees pit alang sied wi&rsquo; an ennin o&rsquo; grants an tha  stert o&rsquo; studen loans. Shairly this is sumthin whuch tha Meinstar must tak a  closer luk at. Ther is wae in whuch maer woarkin cless studens wull stae oan in  further leer an that is by gien mare help en suppoart.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That has meant that fewer working-class Protestant males  apply for university, with money a major factor. That is a real fear when one  considers the level of university fees, coupled with the end of grants and the  beginning of student loans. Surely the Minister must closely review that  situation. More working-class students will stay on in further education if  they are given more help and practical support. The criteria for help and aid  must be looked at again to encourage more people to consider staying at home to  go to university.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister and his Department must take that into account  if we are to induce the working class to go into third-level education. The  idea of going to university is too daunting for young people from many  struggling families. Those young people feel that to bring in money in the  short term is better than a long-term investment in their future. That is the  issue for many people. They weigh up the options of making money in the short  term or making a long-term commitment to university.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are left with the middle classes believing that they can  get a taste of the so-called high life on the mainland at very little extra  cost. They might as well go there than apply to universities in Northern Ireland,  stay here, live at home and continue to struggle as much as they would on the  mainland. The phrase &ldquo;the grass is always greener&rdquo; certainly applies to many  young people who make such decisions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The majority of students who study on the mainland do not  come home. Therefore, they do not bring home their expertise, which would  better Northern Ireland.  We benefit from their work in the form of taxes that are paid to the UK  Treasury and, subsequently, in the distribution to Northern Ireland of the  block grant, but we would benefit more if we kept our bright minds in Northern  Ireland to offer all that they had to move Northern Ireland forward. I have a  simple question for the Minister: how best can we achieve that? That is where  we are coming from in approaching this motion. Some Members who have spoken  have grasped what we are trying to achieve.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The majority of school leavers from the Catholic community  prefer to continue their education at home. Subsequently, they get jobs at  home, and their expertise remains in the Province. That is great. They make a  valuable contribution; that is what I am saying, and that is what my party is  saying.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">What can be done to ensure that the best of all sectors of  the community contribute directly to the Province? That is the issue. I am not  asking for restriction on freedom of movement, not by any stretch of the  imagination. I am asking the Minister what can be done to encourage those who  have, for the most part owing to financial constraints, decided that they may  as well go to the mainland rather than stay at home. We are looking for a plan  of action and a method to address the problems.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has always been responsive to any issues that  I have raised, and I know that he has acted similarly in respect of other  Members who have asked questions. I ask the Minister to ensure that the matter  is not left to worsen as the years go by and that we encourage our students to  get the best education possible.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Can the Member draw his remarks to a close?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I support all the young people in the Province, especially those asking for  help and change.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  I support the motion. I congratulate my colleagues on securing this debate,  which highlights the great loss of potential and talent that Northern Ireland  has experienced over the years. We must try to ensure that students who are considering  going to universities outside Northern Ireland  are encouraged as much as possible to attend the high-quality universities in Northern Ireland.  It is disturbing to note that three quarters &mdash; 74% &mdash; of the students who  expressed a wish to study at universities in other parts of the United Kingdom  were deemed to be from a Protestant/unionist background.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">All Members are aware that pupils in Northern Ireland outperform every other area of  the UK at GCSE,  AS and A level, due to the best education  system in Europe and despite some people&rsquo;s  determination to wreck that system. How can we sit back and watch that talent  and potential walk away from Northern    Ireland? We can no longer allow that  situation to continue; otherwise we will end up with universities that will be  perceived to be Catholic-only institutions. From experiences in my constituency  office, I am aware that some young Protestants have that perception already.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As far as possible, we need our young people to stay in Northern Ireland.  We need their skills in IT, business and bioscience research. The economic  downturn will, eventually, turn into an economic upturn. If our young people do  not gain those skills at our universities, we will not have the skills base in  place to attract the employers who wish to set up business in Northern Ireland, and we risk having a skills  base that is not truly or fairly representative of the Northern Ireland  population.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many people in my East Londonderry constituency have  attended the University of Ulster at the Coleraine campus and the campuses at  Magee and Belfast, and Queen&rsquo;s University &mdash; all excellent universities &mdash; to  attain skills that can be used for the betterment of individuals in Northern  Ireland. I welcome that, but I want to see the Protestant exodus of students  addressed proactively to ensure that we have equality of opportunity for all in  Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I urge the Minister to look at the situation urgently. I  believe that Northern    Ireland has a positive and bright future,  but that future must be based on the inclusion of all in our society. Perhaps  the Minister could look at the courses that students have left their homeland  to study and encourage our native universities to offer those courses. That  could encourage part of the exodus to stay at home. Can the Minister also  examine the financial help that could be given to students, especially those  from socio-economic backgrounds where finance is of particular concern? The  issue will not go away and, if young Protestants feel that local universities  are becoming Catholic-only institutions, it will continue to grow.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>:  On this day of political uncertainly, it is a matter of regret that this motion  is before the Assembly. It is not building on the cornerstone of the Good  Friday Agreement, which is the promotion of partnership between the two  sections of our community. My initial temptation was to ignore the motion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If Mr Campbell wishes me to give way, I am more than happy  to do so.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. According to Mr Dallat&rsquo;s premise, rights,  demands and equality are OK when nationalists are making the demands, but he  seems to have a problem when unionists have a problem that needs to be  addressed. He cannot simply look at the merits of the case.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member has an extra minute.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I  understand Mr Campbell&rsquo;s enthusiasm for asking questions. However, if he had  waited until I had finished my speech, I would have dealt with his issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Rather than ignore the matter, I pay tribute to the two  universities and the other colleges of further education for their outstanding  efforts to promote equality in all its forms. I served on the Committee for  Employment and Learning for some time, and I know just how seriously the  universities take the issue of equality. I also know that they have  courageously attempted to address the underrepresentation of the Protestant  community in the past. The universities have acted decisively on that issue, as  they have on others.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have personal knowledge of the issue: my son Diarmuid  attends the Magee campus of the University   of Ulster. Most of his  friends there are from the Protestant community, and they have never expressed  any concerns, which makes me conclude that he and they are enriched by studying  and working together in a mixed environment. My daughter Helena was not so  lucky and had to go Aberystwyth University in Wales to study. As the father of an  only daughter, I can tell the House that the anguish of losing her was much  greater than the financial problems. However, for her, time abroad was good in  other ways.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>: Wales? Abroad?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I  know that Danny Kennedy has been somewhat confused in recent times. His geography  is not up to what I thought it was, and he has been wandering all over the  place. However, perhaps I will present him with an atlas when I have finished  speaking.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Rather than doing anything to assist the young people in  the Protestant community who are sitting their A levels this year and who are  making the most important decision of their life, the motion will perhaps put  some of them off going to our local universities. I listened to Mr George  Robinson in particular, and God grant that he has no influence. Young people  from the Protestant community in the past unfortunately listened to politicians  and took their advice, which of course was all wrong. Thankfully, the new  generation does not listen as much, does not accept that it is defeated or persecuted  and is working closely together with young people from different communities.  That is happening in Coleraine, for example, where the university is  responsible not just for academic education but for research, in the medium and  long term, which will hopefully generate hundreds if not thousands of jobs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As other contributors to the debate have said, the real  issues are why there is a cap on university numbers here; why many more young  people from the Protestant, Catholic and other communities do not have the  opportunity to stay at home to study; and why, due to our economic problems,  many are not going to university at all. We have a background here of talking a  lot about education, but we also ignore the absolute need to improve our  standards across the entire spectrum. Rather than dwelling on that issue, we  should speak positively and encourage more of our young people to take up the  challenge of going to university so that future generations will have job  security and will not be forced to emigrate to Wales or anywhere else.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I call Ms Dawn Purvis. I think you have about a minute in which to  speak.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Purvis</strong>: I  appreciate your letting me in, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The real question in the debate is not whether our young  people are leaving Northern Ireland to study elsewhere but whether those young  people &mdash; whatever their background &mdash; look to Northern Ireland as a place worth  coming back to following that experience. Sadly, for many the answer is no, and  there is a tragedy in that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland is a relatively small place, and we  will not be able to cater for the ambitions and aspirations of all the young  people who are born here; we understand that. However, what disturbed me most  in reviewing the research on the issue were the suggestions that young people  from integrated education and those who are gay, lesbian and bisexual are the  most determined not to return to Northern Ireland if they leave.  That is a clear indictment of our society as one that does not offer a future  for all.</p>
    <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Speaker in the Chair)</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As other contributors to the debate have said, the figures  indicate only a marginal difference between the number of Protestants and  Catholics leaving to study elsewhere. Whatever the figures are, it is good news  that a healthy proportion of our young people have the chance to study away  from home, experience new things and be exposed to different societies,  cultures and ideas. We will benefit from their experience but only if we can  offer them a place to return to that is inclusive and embraces the broad  spectrum of ideas and innovations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Instead of focusing on ways to chain young people,  Protestant or otherwise, to the Province, the authors of the motion would have  done better to focus their efforts and the motion on creating the type of  society that our young people would choose to live in and choose to come back  to after living, studying or travelling elsewhere. Instead, they focus on  propping up a system of compulsory education that discriminates  disproportionately against working class Protestant boys. I do not support the  motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The debate will continue after Question Time, when the next Member to speak  will be Minister Empey.</p>

    <p class="H4StageHeading">Transfer 2010</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr  Kennedy </strong>asked the Minister of Education for an update on transfer 2010.&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 619/10)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education (Ms Ruane)</strong>: Cuireadh t&uacute;s le haistri&uacute; 2010 cheana f&eacute;in, leis an  mb&eacute;im at&aacute; anois &aacute; cur ar chomhionannas rochtana chuig an iarbhunscoil. Cuireadh  cuid mh&oacute;r eolais ar f&aacute;il do thuismitheoir&iacute; agus do scoileanna lena chinnti&uacute; go  mbeidh p&aacute;ist&iacute; &aacute;balta aistri&uacute; chuig an iarbhunscoil ar bhealach ord&uacute;il faoi na  socruithe do aistri&uacute; 2010 at&aacute; anois i bhfeidhm.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Transfer 2010, with its emphasis on equality for all  children in post-primary education, is now well under way. A significant volume  of information has been provided to parents and schools to help ensure that  children are able to transfer in an orderly fashion, with equality at its core,  under the transfer 2010 arrangements that have been put in place.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My Department published two advice leaflets for parents of  P7 children in September and December 2009, and it also issued detailed  operational guidance to schools in September 2009 initially, with an updated  version issued in December 2009. That was supplemented with separate and  detailed advice on the issues of setting workable admissions criteria that  abide by the law and the obligations of primary school principals facing  demands for information to assist breakaway schools with the application of  academic admissions criteria. That will be kept under review, and further  advice will be issued as necessary.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier this month, education and library boards published  transfer booklets containing details of all schools&rsquo; admissions criteria. Those  booklets, along with school open nights, which are currently happening, will  inform the process of parents completing a transfer form at a meeting with the  primary school principal in February. Boards, or the education and skills  authority, if it is established in time, will process transfer forms to reflect  parental preference and the availability of places over the ensuing weeks, with  equality at the core &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-size:10.0pt; ">[Interruption.]</span></span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: That will lead to the issuing of placement letters at the end of  May 2010. Parents who are unhappy with school placement decisions may submit an  appeal to an independent appeals tribunal.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Before I call Mr Kennedy for a supplementary question, I remind Members that it  is important that they continually rise in their place if they wish to ask a  supplementary question &mdash; &ldquo;continually&rdquo; is the important word.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  In light of the clear fact that the vast majority of schools are ignoring the  Minister&rsquo;s transfer 2010 policy, does she not now, even at this late stage,  accept that her vision has failed? Will she join with other parties in entering  talks on the issue of post-primary transfer without preconditions and with her  mind open to the wishes of not only the House, but the vast majority of  parents?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Unlike Members on the opposite Benches, who claim to represent  the unionist community, I do not hide my head in the sand. I do not ignore the  numbers of young people leaving our schools with inadequate literacy and  numeracy. Neither I nor my party has ignored the number of young people who  have been failed by our education system. The past distortion of the primary  school curriculum has been a major factor in leading to the numbers of young  people who are leaving the system without the levels of literacy and numeracy  that we would like them to have.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Members opposite can continue to ignore that and  pretend that there is no impact, or they can join with the rest of us in understanding  the impact of the selective system in the past on our primary curriculum and on  our young people as they move on.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have had the talks and the discussions. I think that  there are questions that the SDLP must answer to its constituency. Is that  party departing from a 40-year policy of saying that it is opposed to academic  selection and inequality?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My party is totally and utterly opposed to academic  selection and to inequality in the education system, and we will not continue  with a system that discriminates against children, whether they are from the  Catholic community, the Protestant community or any ethnic minority community.  We are putting equality &mdash; comhionannas &mdash; as the cornerstone of the education  system, and we are proud that we are doing that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Does the Minister have any plans or  proposals to introduce a regulated transfer system for current P6 pupils?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: B&rsquo;fhearr liom c&oacute;ras rialaithe aistrithe a bheith i bhfeidhm,  agus t&aacute; m&eacute; r&eacute;idh le hoibri&uacute; chun sin a bhaint amach.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I would prefer that a regulated system of transfer were put  in place, and I am ready to work towards that. We cannot move forward on the  issue until there is a common understanding that testing children at age 10 or  11 is unnecessary and detrimental to their educational development. Children  should be entitled to education; it is theirs by right, not because they failed  or passed a test.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  The Minister says repeatedly that equality is at the heart of all she does, so  will she explain how, as shown by the publication of the education and library  boards&rsquo; prospectuses for schools, hardly any schools have taken her advice on  equality in regard to free school meals? One of the schools that have ignored  the Minister happens to be that of a senior bishop of a religious order in Northern Ireland  of which I am not a member. Why has the controlled sector been ignored yet  again, and why have councillors not been appointed to the transitional  arrangements leading to the reconstitution of the education and library boards?  Can the Minister explain that, and, for the first time, give the House an  answer?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Thankfully, the vast majority of schools in the system have  operated fair admissions criteria. Only a small number of schools have departed  and operated breakaway admissions criteria. I am glad that the Member has noted  what the Catholic Church is doing, and I hope that he will join me in  commending the Catholic Church at the highest level, as expressed by Cardinal  Brady, on telling all schools in the Catholic sector that they should abide by  transfer 2010 and that they should not operate breakaway tests.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. How many schools have adopted the  transfer 2010 guidelines? Will the Minister agree that the schools that will  use the guidelines are already doing so in any case and that the majority of  schools have ignored them, rendering them ineffectual? Will she further agree  with me and with her colleague Jennifer McCann that the problem of transfer  continues because nothing has been put in its place?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I certainly agree with Jennifer McCann that equality needs to be  the cornerstone of the education system. <em>[Interruption.]</em></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I listened carefully to what Jennifer McCann said, and I pay  tribute to her for her stance in opposition to academic selection and for her  support for equality to be at the core of the education system. Jennifer, like  me and every Member on the Sinn F&eacute;in Benches, understands the importance of not  failing children. I urge Members on the other Benches, who have their heads in  the sand, to get a transcript of Jennifer&rsquo;s interviews and listen to and take  advice from her. <em>[Interruption.]</em></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Jennifer and I agree on the matter. As the Member said, the vast  majority of schools have been operating a fair system in relation to free  school meals. Members will know that the secondary sector has a higher  proportion of children who receive free school meals. That is not fair, and it  will not continue, because we need more equality in the system.</p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading">Special Educational Needs &nbsp;and Inclusion Review</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr  Boylan </strong>asked the Minister of Education why the consultation period for the  review of special educational needs and inclusion has been extended.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 620/10)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Eis&iacute;odh an ch&aacute;ip&eacute;is chomhairli&uacute;ch&aacute;in &lsquo;Gach Scoil ina Scoil  Mhaith &mdash; an Bealach chun Tosaigh do Riachtanais Speisialta Oideachais agus  Chuimsi&uacute;&rsquo; le haghaidh comhairli&uacute;ch&aacute;in ar an 10 L&uacute;nasa 2009, agus ba &eacute; an 31  Deireadh F&oacute;mhair 2009 an ch&eacute;ad d&aacute;ta deiridh do fhreagra&iacute;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The consultation document &lsquo;Every School a Good School: The  Way Forward for Special Educational Needs and Inclusion&rsquo; was issued for  consultation on 10 August 2009 with an initial closing date for responses of 31  October 2009. As there had been a delay of more than one year while the  Executive considered the draft consultation document, and following their  approval in July 2009, I agreed to issue the document for consultation as soon  as possible to avoid further delay and to enable the public, schools and other  stakeholders to begin to consider the proposals. After a number of requests  from parents, schools, MLAs and others, I agreed to extend the closing date to  30 November 2009. Then, in early December, after further consideration, I  decided to further extend the consultation period to 31 January 2010. My  decision is based upon my firm belief that provision for children with special  educational needs is of vital importance, especially to parents and schools. I  want to ensure that everyone who wishes to respond to the proposals in the  document has the time to do so.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is imperative that provision for children with special  educational needs builds upon the good practice that is already evidenced in  many schools and that it is substantially improved upon so that no child has to  experience a delay before the appropriate intervention is put in place.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The review proposals aim to build the capacity of schools  to meet more effectively the needs of pupils with special educational needs  through earlier identification of need, effective use of school-based  interventions and through the advice and support that is available to them from  a range of professionals, when necessary.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her answer. How much of the funding for special  educational needs will be spent on groups that have additional educational  needs, such as Traveller or newcomer children? Go raibh maith agat.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Chathail. N&iacute; aitreofar aon chisti&uacute; &oacute;  riachtanais speisialta oideachais chuig gr&uacute;pa&iacute; eile a aithn&iacute;odh faoi  choinceapanna riachtanais bhreise oideachais.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">No funding will be diverted from special educational needs  to the other groups that have been identified within the additional educational  needs concept. Each of the groups that have been identified has its own  specific policy and attracts its own funding streams. That will continue to be  the case.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In 2007-08, around &pound;185 million was spent on special  educational needs. In 2008-09, &pound;202 million was spent on special educational  needs; &pound;6&middot;5 million was spent on supporting newcomer children; &pound;1&middot;1 million was  spent on our Traveller children; &pound;569,000 was spent on school-aged mothers;  &pound;345,000 was spent on looked-after children; &pound;7&middot;65 million was spent on  promoting positive behaviour; and &pound;1&middot;99 million was spent on the emotional  health and well-being of pupils.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that any changes in special educational needs procedure  should not threaten the statutory rights of the children who have special needs  or those of their parents?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I absolutely agree that it is important that the money that goes  to our children with special educational needs is ring-fenced. I know that some  people have stated that that is not the case; therefore, I will clarify it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Meastar go mbeidh leithdh&aacute;ilt&iacute; a thugtar do scoileanna mar  gheall ar riachtanais speisialta oideachais so-aitheanta agus inmhonat&oacute;iri&uacute;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is envisaged that allocations that are made to schools  under any special educational needs factor that might be developed under the  local management of schools formula will be easily identifiable to schools,  and, therefore, will be able to be monitored.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During the talks that led to the St Andrews Agreement, and,  indeed, in any discussions that we have had, my party always prioritised rights  and equality. Those rights and the equality of children will continue to be  prioritised.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Does the Minister acknowledge the findings of the Lamb inquiry, which showed  that parents value a statement of special educational needs because it is  legally enforceable and that they want a new system to work better than the  present one? Will she assure the House that she will take into consideration  the findings of the Lamb inquiry? Does she think that parents have a lack of  trust in her to deliver a suitable policy?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Is &iacute; is aidhm do na togra&iacute; n&aacute; sol&aacute;thar do ph&aacute;ist&iacute; agus do  dhaoine &oacute;ga a bhfuil riachtanais speisialta oideachais acu a fheabhs&uacute; taobh  istigh den scoil.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The proposals aim to enhance the provision for children and  young people with special educational needs within their school setting, by  ensuring that they get the right support at the right time, without the need to  wait for long periods for external assessment or support when it can be  provided from within the school&rsquo;s resources. The proposals do not and will not  reduce the rights of parents as currently available to them through the appeals  mechanism of the special educational needs and disability tribunal. Depending  on the detailed outworking of the proposals, parental rights may be differently  reflected, but that detail is yet to be developed and can only be considered  following consideration of the responses to the consultation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have been to many special schools and have met with the  parents of many children with special educational needs. Our Department  consulted with a very wide range of parents and educationalists, and we have  produced for consideration a very thorough policy. We welcome anyone and  everyone making a contribution to it, and we will read the responses very carefully.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Question 3 has been withdrawn.</p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading">STEM Projects</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Rev Dr  Robert Coulter </strong>asked the Minister of Education why funds for developing  science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects have been  returned to the Department of Finance and Personnel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 622/10)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Chuir mo Roinn cisti&uacute; faoi urr&uacute;s &oacute;n gciste nu&aacute;la&iacute;ochta le  taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt d&rsquo;&aacute;bhair STEM agus d&rsquo;fh&aacute;s sainscoileanna STEM; t&aacute; m&eacute;  s&aacute;sta go bhfuil seacht scoil d&eacute;ag a bhfuil sainainmn&iacute;ochta&iacute; STEM acu. T&aacute;imid ag  d&eacute;anamh r&eacute;imse an-leathan nu&aacute;la&iacute;ochta&iacute; eile chun STEM a chur chun cinn.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My Department secured funding from the Innovation Fund Ireland to  support STEM subjects and the growth of STEM specialist schools. I am pleased  that we now have 17 schools with STEM specialist designation. We are  undertaking a wide range of other interventions to promote science, technology,  engineering and maths. A programme of professional development for teachers has  been commissioned to promote and support STEM in the primary and post-primary  sectors within the revised curriculum, as well as improving the range and  quality of resources available to teachers and pupils. We are also supporting  the Institute of Physics  in Ireland  and the establishment of a physics teacher network here. STEM-focused career  education, information, advice and guidance are other crucial elements of our  efforts to promote STEM subjects and pathways.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clearly, our work to raise standards in literacy and  numeracy also contributes to ensuring that young people have the opportunity to  develop the communication and mathematical skills they need to access STEM  subjects and STEM careers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My Department funds a number of exciting, major events  designed to encourage our young people to consider careers in STEM. Last week,  I told the Assembly about the BT Young Scientist and Technology competition.  This year, entries to that from the North had increased by 66%. I was delighted  once again to host a reception in the Long Gallery for all the students from the  North who entered the competition and to attend the award ceremony in Dublin at which two out  of four of the top awards in this island were made to schools in the North. My  Department also funds the STEM Experience, which is planned to run for three  years and aims to promote a better understanding of STEM. A total of 1,822  primary school pupils from P6 and P7, and 1,842 secondary pupils in years 8 to  10, attended the events. We also fund the very successful &pound;1&middot;2 million STEM  truck, which is a resource that benefits the entire island of Ireland  and a wide range of schools.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: It is a mobile teaching laboratory. What is happening is very  exciting, but I am not complacent, and there is lots more work to be done. We  have to find the spark &mdash; the chispa &mdash; that ignites the fire of learning in our  young people.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert  Coulter</strong>: Will the Minister tell the House whether the entire budget for  STEM subjects has been used, and how much has been returned?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: My Department secured funding from the innovation fund to  support the growth of STEM specialist schools. That funding included a &pound;3  million resource allocation that is fully committed and a capital element that  can be used only to support capital projects that are related to STEM  specialist schools. As the innovation fund is a central ring-fenced fund, it  cannot be used to support other areas of capital development, and, if it is  unused, it must be returned to the Department of Finance and Personnel (DFP).</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Funding for the innovation fund was confirmed in January  2008 when the Executive published the 2008-2011 Budget, by which time important  lessons had been learned from the experience of previous capital support grants  to specialist schools. After a review of the policy, and based on the  experience of schools in previous years, the funding arrangements were changed,  and the capital support grant was removed and replaced by a current support  grant. The same level of capital funding was not, therefore, needed, and the  additional recurrent funding was made available through the existing Budget.  The costs associated with the construction of the STEM truck fell &mdash; I am sure  that Members are glad to hear that &mdash; thereby leaving a surplus in the 2009-2010  Budget of &pound;816,000. In line with current budgeting rules, there is no  flexibility to transfer capital budget to recurrent budgets, and there is a  clear responsibility to secure value for money from all public expenditure.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Education declared other easements in  respect of funding from the innovation fund. Those were: &pound;0&middot;6 million, which  was caused by difficulties in recruiting staff, increasing the programme of  professional development in STEM areas and the lower than expected bids  received from STEM specialist schools; and &pound;51,000, &pound;40,000 of which was caused  by delays in recruiting staff to identify gaps in STEM curricular resources and  developing and disseminating such resources to promote STEM in the primary and  post-primary sectors, and &pound;11,000 of which was caused by the lower than  expected cost of the independent panel&rsquo;s assessing the STEM applications from  schools.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  I acknowledge the Minister&rsquo;s comments about the importance of access to, and  growth of, STEM subjects. Will the Minister outline her Department&rsquo;s  implementation plan for the STEM review?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: As Members know, the STEM report is a comprehensive document  that was jointly launched by Reg Empey and me. The launch was exciting and  innovative, and it took place on the same day that we launched the STEM truck,  which I was proud to be part of showcasing at the BT Young Scientist and  Technology Exhibition in Dublin.  The truck was at the exhibition all week, and students from all over the island  had the opportunity to see it. I am happy to forward a copy of the STEM report  and the Department&rsquo;s implementation plan to the Member, if he does not already  have them.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Before I call Lord Browne, I remind Members that it is important that they  continually rise in their place if they wish to ask a supplementary question.  There is no point in Members&rsquo; rising once and then thinking that they will be  called to ask a supplementary question, because that will not happen. I make  that absolutely clear. I do not know how many times the Deputy Speakers and I  have had to say that in recent weeks.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Browne</strong>:  Will the Minister tell us the rationale for reducing the capital funding of  STEM from &pound;75,000 to &pound;25,000?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I already explained in a detailed answer that the capital  funding is ring-fenced, and the rules for that. <span class="Italic"><span style="font-size:10.0pt; ">[Interruption.]</span></span> I am not going to take  the time to repeat that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Most Members will, objectively,  recognise the value of STEM subjects in rebuilding and sustaining a viable  economy here. Will the Minister give us an indication of the events that her  Department funds in promoting STEM subjects?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Go raibh maith agat as an cheist sin, agus aonta&iacute;m leat faoi  STEM. Promotion of STEM subjects is important for future economic growth, and  my Department is fully committed to playing its role. I also wish to mention  the revised curriculum, because it focuses on ensuring that all pupils have the  opportunity to develop knowledge and skills in communications, mathematics, ICT  and science, and the skills needed to succeed in life and work.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some of the best experiences that I have witnessed involved  young people in primary schools learning science through play. I watched one  class, in which the children had built a volcano and learned about volcanoes  through an interactive whiteboard. Those children did not realise that they  were learning. However, they were learning, and in a real and very stimulating  way. That is much better than the 11-plus, in which children learned about the  life cycle of the frog and, in many ways, were bored to death. <em>[Interruption.]</em></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: For the past two years, and for the first time ever, we have  been funding the BT Young Scientist and Technology exhibition in Dublin, which is an  absolutely fantastic event. I have been working very closely with BT and with  schools in the North; and, every year, there is an incredible increase in  participation in that event.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier, I mentioned the Institute  of Physics in Ireland, and  the Department has a special programme with primary school principals. On the  North/South agenda, there was a conference in Cavan on the teaching of  mathematics in primary schools, which brought together teachers from across the  island to share good practice.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department is funding a specialist schools programme,  and there are 17 schools with specialist designations in science, technology  and mathematics. Reg Empey and I, and our Departments, are working very closely  to ensure the promotion of science, technology, engineering and maths.</p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading">Educational Disadvantage</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr K  Robinson </strong>asked the Minister of Education for her assessment of whether  there is educational disadvantage among Protestant boys compared to the rest of  the population.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 623/10)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: B&iacute;onn m&iacute;bhunt&aacute;iste oideachas&uacute;il ann i measc buachaill&iacute; agus  cail&iacute;n&iacute; Protast&uacute;nacha agus Caitliceacha araon. Is minic a bh&iacute;onn baint aige seo  le m&iacute;bhunt&aacute;iste socheacnama&iacute;och agus go mb&iacute;onn s&eacute; n&iacute;os measa mar gheall ar an  easpa d&oacute;chais.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Educational disadvantage exists among Protestants and  Catholics, among boys and girls, and among our ethnic minorities. Too often, it  is related to socio-economic disadvantage and is compounded by poverty of  aspiration.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Educational underachievement can be defined as those  children who leave school without having achieved at least five good GCSEs at  grades A* to C, including maths and English or Irish. In 2007 to 2008, the  number of Catholic boys not achieving at that level was greater than the number  of Protestant boys, with almost 2,900 Catholic boys compared to just over 2,600  Protestant boys. Although that represents a greater number of Catholic boys, a  greater percentage of Protestant boys did not achieve at least five good GCSEs,  with 52% of Protestant boys versus 48% of Catholic boys not achieving at that  level.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For girls, the picture is very similar, with 38% of  Protestant girls not achieving at that level, compared to 36&middot;5% of Catholic  girls. However, at 2,200, the number of Catholic girls who do not achieve at  least five good GCSEs, including maths and English or Irish, is greater than  the number of Protestant girls, at almost 1,900.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that my answer shows the importance of us not  sectarianising the debate. We need to deal with underachievement wherever and  whenever it exists. I am fully committed to improving outcomes for all young  people whether they are Catholic or Protestant, boys or girls, or from our  newcomer communities, the children from which have so many hurdles to overcome.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am putting in place a jigsaw of interconnected policies  that put the child at the centre of the education system. For example, the  &lsquo;Every School a Good School&rsquo; policy, transfer 2010, the revised curriculum, the  literacy and numeracy strategy, the review of special educational needs and  inclusion, the Achieving Belfast and Derry programmes, and the establishment of  the ESA.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  Despite the smokescreen that the Minister has put up, she often regales the  House with her claims that she is concerned about children from the Shankill,  Rathcoole, the Waterside and other areas. Given the empirical facts in front of  her, why, since 2007, has the Minister not addressed that specific issue?</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I am looking at the empirical facts. I respectfully suggest that  every Member on the Benches opposite studies very carefully the empirical  facts. The Members opposite have hidden their heads in the sand. They are  afraid, for whatever reason, to deal with some of the deep inequalities that  affect children from the Falls, the Shankill and the Waterside.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have brought forward policies and proposals; I am not  afraid to deal with the impact of academic selection on our working-class  areas. I have shown Members the statistics for the number of children from the  Shankill and New Lodge that get access to grammar schools. I am not the one  sectarianising the debate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have brought forward policies that are based on dealing  with inequality, wherever it exists. Neither I nor my party is afraid to deal  with the difficult issues, and we will not stand by and watch as more generations  of young people are failed by the system. That is why we have a literacy and  numeracy strategy; that is why we have the review of special needs and  inclusion; that is why we have our task force on the education of Traveller  children; that is why we have our Achieving Belfast and Achieving Derry  initiatives; and that is why we have transfer 2010.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are taking on the small number of people who do not want  change in the system. Those people think that, if they operate breakaway tests,  they will stop us from continuing with our proposals. However, they will not.</p>
    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="8"></a>Employment and Learning</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Belfast   Metropolitan College</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Ms N&iacute;  Chuil&iacute;n </strong>asked the Minister for Employment and Learning why the consultants  appointed to review the efficiency of Belfast Metropolitan   College were not able to  meet with the former director. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  633/10)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning (Sir Reg Empey)</strong>: When the review was undertaken,  the college director was ill. He has subsequently retired on ill-health  grounds.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Will the Minister confirm whether the Department of Finance and Personnel will  have any involvement in the review that will take place at Belfast Metropolitan   College?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: The review has been completed, and work is ongoing  on its implementation. There is a new chief executive at the college, and she  has made it clear that the college and the board are working very closely on  the implementation of the recommendations in the review. I am confident now  that the new chief executive is in place. The chief executive post was filled  for a long period by Dr Raymond Mullan, who was acting up. He did a first-class  job under very difficult circumstances. With the new arrangements in place, the  college will be able to restore its financial position to the extent that we  can be confident that it can go forward into the future.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I note what the Minister said, and I understand the circumstances in which the  previous director was not effectively consulted. That was regrettable, but we  have a new director for the college, we have a review and we have an  opportunity to move forward. Does the Minister agree that that represents a  very important opportunity for the college to move forward in this new decade?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I agree with the honourable Member. The new  director will address the Committee for Employment and Learning in the middle  of next month, and it is my hope that we will have a meeting before that. The  financial position for the year before last was unsatisfactory but, in the  current year, although there may continue to be a deficit, it will be on a much  smaller scale, and the college will have the reserves to meet it. The combination  of those events and decisions will result in the college coming back into  balance shortly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The provision of education is the primary objective, and I  should say that I am satisfied that it is continuing and that the number of  students is continuing to grow. The college is well placed, particularly given  that the new estate is being built in the Titanic Quarter. It has a bright  future as our largest single further education college, and I am confident that  we have taken the steps that are necessary to ensure its viable future.</p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading">Holylands Area</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr  Spratt </strong>asked the Minister for Employment and Learning to outline progress  on issues affecting the Holylands area of south Belfast following the Holylands stakeholder  forum held in October 2009. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  634/10)</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">15. <strong>Mr  Cobain </strong>asked the Minister for Employment and Learning what plans he has to  promote improved student-community relations surrounding this year&rsquo;s St  Patrick&rsquo;s Day holiday, especially in the Holylands area of Belfast.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  647/10)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: With your permission, Mr Speaker, I will take  questions 2 and 15 together.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I confirm that additional community safety wardens were  deployed in the university area from 25 October 2009 to provide support during  the Halloween period. Moreover, the PSNI dedicated significant resources to the  area. Overall feedback has been positive, and it is hoped that the same  procedure will have a beneficial impact on St Patrick&rsquo;s Day 2010.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>: I  thank the Minister and his Department for their initiatives with the Holylands  stakeholder forum. I am concerned about St Patrick&rsquo;s Day this year and want to  know exactly what discussions have taken place, particularly with the PSNI, the  universities and other organisations, to put measures in place to ensure that,  compared with last year, we have a good St Patrick&rsquo;s Day this year.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I share the honourable Member&rsquo;s hope and  expectation that St Patrick&rsquo;s Day 2010 will be an enjoyable occasion for the  students and people in the Holylands area. As the Member may know, the  inter-agency group has been expanded in the past few months to include  Departments, including my own, and other relevant organisations. Moreover,  Belfast City Council has established the Holylands inter-agency group, and  planning approval is being sought to place CCTV cameras in the Holylands area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On the question of student and community relations, since  March 2009 I have been actively involved in discussions with key stakeholders,  including, as the Member will know, elected Members, residents&rsquo; groups,  landlords and the licensed trade. We have had two major meetings, and  consultants and a facilitator have worked throughout the summer to prepare a  report. We are working closely with the police and have consulted the Northern  Ireland Office, the Department for Social Development, the Department for  Regional Development and other agencies.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member will know that it is not possible to guarantee  anything. All that I can say to him is that the level of engagement has been  much higher and more intense than it has been at any previous time. After last  year&rsquo;s events, I decided that it was necessary for the Executive to take the  lead on the situation. We have done that throughout the past year, and I hope  that our actions bear fruit. We have engaged heavily with students and the  student body because, at the end of the day, their members are involved in the  problem. However, people from outside the area come into it to exploit the  situation. The PSNI has a clear role in that area. I do not want to consider it  a law and order situation, but I hope that the measures that we have taken will  help to alleviate the situation.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his progress  report. Given that virtually all respondents to the stakeholder forum&rsquo;s initial  piece of work attached high importance to the question of compulsory landlord  registration, has the Minister discussed the matter with any other Ministers,  particularly the Minister for Social Development?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: As the Member may be aware, there has been  extensive communication between the various Departments, and it is perfectly  obvious that a multi-agency and multi-Department approach has been taken to the  matter. The Member will know from his experience in other places that there has  been an underlying planning issue in that area for a long time. People ignored  local representatives&rsquo; advice year after year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That said, the whole area has been taken over by local  landlords who rent out houses for multiple occupation. The local residents feel  marginalised, pressurised and, in some cases, intimidated. I can assure the  Member that all the agencies that we could find and that have a role have been  engaged up to ministerial level.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Mr Speaker, I will take this opportunity to thank you and your staff, and colleagues  from all parties, for the warm welcome that you have given me.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Minister is no doubt aware and as Mr Spratt pointed  out, the St Patrick&rsquo;s Day celebrations are now upon us. Last week, Ms Ramsey  kindly provided me with a copy of the response from the University of Ulster.  In that response, the university advocated the extension of extra powers to the  police to deal with situations such as those that occurred in the Holylands,  and said that it would support emergency legislation for the extension of  on-the-spot fines by the police in such situations. What is the Minister&rsquo;s  opinion of that? Furthermore, does the Minister have an update on the proposed  schools outreach programme that was to be undertaken? What numbers of schools  have been contacted across this region? Has there been a positive uptake of  that programme?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: As my colleague said, that was more of a maiden  speech than a question. <span class="Italic"><span style="font-size:10.0pt; ">[Laughter.] </span></span>I suspect that the warm welcome that the Member has received in  this place will no doubt be short-lived.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I cannot be precise about the school outreach programme,  but I will write to the Member about that. We have had extensive discussions  with the police about the Holylands issue, but I do not see this as a purely  law and order situation. I was there at 11.00 pm on St Patrick&rsquo;s night last  year, and the idea of PSNI officers going around issuing spot fines did not  strike me as something that would be very successful. There were other issues,  such as the inability to go into a garden where a lot of young people were  gathered. Paul Goggins, the Northern    Ireland Office Minister of State, has been  represented in the discussions with the stakeholder forum, and I have written  to him. The police have been heavily involved, but the idea is that we should  avoid having to involve them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not want to see police Land Rovers in the Holylands at  7.00 am on St Patrick&rsquo;s Day to occupy the ground. I want people to celebrate  and have an enjoyable day; that is the way it should be. Unfortunately, some  elements from outside see an opportunity to have a bit of a rumble and to  attack the police and whatever other authority figures might be in the area.  Sadly, the people who get the real hammering are the students who want to go  about their business and the unfortunate residents who are subjected to those  disturbances all the time, not just on one day of the year.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  commend the Minister for his effort in co-ordinating the work on the issue in  south Belfast.  However, there is a need for ongoing inter-agency work, because there are so  many different issues that contribute to the bigger problem on St Patrick&rsquo;s  Day. The misuse of drink has been a big problem in the area. Has there been any  progress on licensing issues and on addressing the low cost of drink?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I know that my colleague the Minister of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety is looking at that. There is quite a lot of  evidence to suggest that the unit price of alcohol is an issue. The licensed  trade was represented on the stakeholder forum, and it is promoting a code of  practice among its membership. Some might say that such a code of practice  might be fairly weak, but I welcome any progress in this area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Nevertheless, I believe that there should be a national  decision on the price of a unit of alcohol. I am not against people having a  good time, but what I saw last St  Patrick&rsquo;s Day, and what has been seen in other situations throughout the city  on other occasions, is not about having a good time. It goes beyond that, and, unfortunately,  a lot of young people frequently get hurt, and others get criminal records. The  licensed trade must be extremely careful in its response. In certain  supermarkets, however, large amounts of alcohol can sometimes be bought for  less than water.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading">Training Programmes: East   Londonderry</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr  Campbell </strong>asked the Minister for Employment and Learning how many people who  have been made redundant in East Londonderry  in the last two years have entered retraining programmes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 635/10)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: My Department does not collect information that  identifies individuals who enrol on training programmes after being made  redundant. The Department is notified when more than 20 people are made  redundant. During 2008 and up to November 2009, there were 1,035 redundancies  in the East Londonderry constituency. The  figure for 2008 was 863, which was mainly a reflection of the closure of  Seagate Technology in Limavady. Workers who are made redundant are eligible for  early entry, on a voluntary basis, to Steps to Work, which is the Department&rsquo;s  main employment programme. From 1 April 2008 to 30 November 2009, some 2,280  people started on the Steps to Work and New Deal programmes in the East Londonderry constituency.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer. Given that most of those who undertake  those training and skills programmes are endeavouring to gain employment in the  small and medium-sized enterprise sector or wish to become self-employed, how  adaptable are those programmes in preparing people for those types of  employment?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: The Department&rsquo;s current suite of programmes is  infinitely more flexible than that of a number of years ago. As the Member will  know, someone who becomes unemployed can attempt to form his or her own  business, and he or she will retain benefits for up to 26 weeks to help with  that opportunity. That is the most flexible scheme possible. If an individual  spots a genuine opportunity to get a job, a variety of schemes is available,  and we will help as best we can. Rather than having a situation in which more  people chase fewer positions, we must concentrate on stimulating jobs. I stress  that the suite of options that we now have at our disposal is as good as we have  ever had.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. How do those recent figures for Steps  to Work compare with figures that were released last week showing that  unemployment is on the increase? Does the Minister envisage the recent Budget  statement having a negative impact on unemployment? Although that was issued  from a different Department, there are issues about reskilling and upskilling.  I am concerned because, if the Minister is saying that more people are joining  the Steps to Work programme, surely the unemployment figures should have come  down?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: It is true that the unemployment figure rose  slightly, but the rate of growth slowed significantly, as was the case  nationally. The Northern Ireland  figure remains lower than that for the rest of the UK, significantly lower than that  in the Republic and below the European average. That, of course, is no relief  to those who are currently unemployed or worried about unemployment. If I may  make a political point, sometimes the bubble within which we occupy ourselves  in this place is some distance from the worries and concerns of ordinary people  who are worried about their jobs, education and health. At times, our list of  priorities differs from theirs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I assure the Member, however, that the Department works  with the local authorities. In the East Londonderry  area we worked with Limavady Borough Council, Coleraine Borough Council and  Derry City Council on, for example, job fairs. All the help that we provide is  through partnership at a local level.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText" style="text-indent:0cm;">The Member asked why unemployment  figures are not going down. Unfortunately, the number of redundancies is  increasing in certain sectors. That is particularly true of manufacturing and  services, from which more and more people have been added to the unemployment  register. Today, approximately 47% more people are on the register than 12  months ago.. That gives some sense of the additional workload that our systems  have had to accommodate.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>:  The figures for East Derry are startling,  particularly on a day when there appears to be grave political instability.  What means does the Minister have to track training schemes to ensure that  people are not in a revolving door, joining scheme after scheme? What  opportunities are there for employers to evaluate courses? I thank the Minister  for his efforts to date in my constituency, which must be among the worst  affected.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: All levels of training are subject to quality  assessment by the Education and Training Inspectorate. Therefore, a regime is  in place to ensure quality. The Member asked whether we are going around in  circles, and the fact that that was happening was one of the criticisms of the  previous New Deal arrangements. I believe that the new arrangements are of a  higher quality.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We need to conduct what are described as longitudinal studies.  We are carrying out studies on the new contract arrangements that were entered  into. I accept that they did not start off as vigorously as they should have  done, but they are coming on. The training providers have performance  indicators for the schemes that inform the Department whether it is getting  value for money. I assure the Member that it is in our interests to ensure that  such information is at our disposal.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will consider whether a longitudinal study to evaluate  and check against the risk that the Member raised should be carried out, and I  am happy to write to the Member in that regard.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his responses and his efforts, not only in my  constituency but in other employment black spots throughout Northern Ireland.  Will the Minister briefly outline what retraining programmes are available?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: A variety of programmes is available. The  programmes depend on the individual&rsquo;s particular circumstances. We have introduced  a suite of services that has been particularly tailored to anyone with a  disability or learning disabilities. Our staff are trained to identify those  needs; that is an integral part of the process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Several programmes are available to someone who signs on.  The Member is familiar with the principal schemes, as he has joined me on at  least one occasion in visiting some of the facilities. All-age apprenticeships  are available, and we work closely with further education colleges. The Bridge  to Employment scheme is a bespoke recruitment and pre-employment training  programme designed to help people learn the skills needed to be job-ready from  day one of their employ&shy;ment. Our Training for Success scheme is well known as  the Department&rsquo;s major flagship scheme.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have a sufficient variety of facilities at our disposal.  The key factor is not just skilling unemployed people but upskilling many  people who are already in employment. We must endeavour to have the prevention  as well as the cure.</p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading">Management Skills</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Rev Dr  Robert Coulter </strong>asked the Minister for Employment and Learning what  assistance is being provided by his Department to promote investment in  management skills and development during the economic downturn.&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 636/10)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I have made available a wide range of management  and leadership programmes, which are aimed at meeting the needs of new entrants  right up to senior directors. Since March 2009, the Department has offered 100%  funding across a range of approved programmes to enhance uptake of leadership  and management development.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Almost 600 individual managers and 120 companies have been  engaged to date. The successful initiative has been complemented by a dedicated  and ongoing awareness-raising campaign across Northern Ireland. The Made Not Born  campaign aims to show small and medium-sized enterprises the benefits that  better leadership and management can bring to business.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As outlined in Minister Foster&rsquo;s earlier statement and  highlighted in the independent review of economic policy report, Members will  note that my Department has collaborated with Invest NI in the development of  an integrated framework for management and leadership to improve support in  that important area.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert  Coulter</strong>: The publication &lsquo;Management Matters in Northern   Ireland and the Republic of Ireland&rsquo;  places special emphasis on small and medium-sized enterprises. Will the  Minister outline what steps he has taken to develop management capabilities in  that area?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong><span style="font-size:11.0pt; ">The Minister for Employment and Learning: </span></strong>The Member hits on a  point that is dear to my heart. The vast majority of businesses in Northern Ireland  are small, and perhaps the greatest difficulties arise for such businesses.  Members can imagine that it is extremely difficult for a small business, in  which the proprietor may carry out multiple jobs, to allow a staff member to  spend time training away from the company. The irony is that companies that  invest in training help their long-term survival prospects by doing so. We  offer management and leadership training at nil cost to a company. I have tried  to maintain the 100% funding because I believe that that is the best way in  which we can contribute in that area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The second way in which we contribute is by trying to make  companies aware of the options that are available to them. The Department&rsquo;s  contribution has been a combination of those two measures: offering management  training at nil cost to a company and making companies aware of the  significance of receiving extra training. All the reports and evidence  throughout these islands are clear that the more effort and resources a company  puts into training, the better that company&rsquo;s survival chances will be.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  fully support the Minister&rsquo;s work on management and leadership development  programmes. In light of the significant cuts to departmental spending that were  announced in the recent budgetary review for 2010-11, is the Minister in a  position to say whether he will be able to protect those important programmes  from spending cuts?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong><span style="font-size:11.0pt; ">The Minister for Employment and Learning: </span></strong>I cannot anticipate an  announcement from my colleague the Minister of Finance and Personnel. I would  be happy to make the announcement for him, but that is not possible. However, I  can tell the Member that I have placed much emphasis on this area of activity.  The 100% funding was to be brought in only for a limited time, but I agreed to  extend the period during which it is available.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My Department&rsquo;s spending power was due to increase by more  than 6% in 2010-11. Therefore, I have directed any efficiencies and reductions  required by the Executive into areas in which growth was already due to take  place. That approach to the proposals may mean that growth is restricted rather  than any actual cuts having to be made in cash terms. I should also point out  that the Executive are considering how they can create more efficiencies across  the public sector. If they achieve further efficiencies on pay, for example,  the sums of money generated will be put back into the pot, and Departments will  have to reduce their spending by less.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>: I  also congratulate the Minister on the schemes that he has brought forward. Are  any of those schemes available to the agriculture industry?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong><span style="font-size:11.0pt; ">The Minister for Employment and Learning: </span></strong>I am sorry that my  colleague from North Belfast is not in the  Chamber because he could have prompted me in some of my responses.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The schemes are available throughout Northern Ireland.  The Department for Employment and Learning deals primarily with individuals. In  other words, the services that we provide are people-driven rather than  geographically driven.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Member knows, we also work very closely with the College of Agriculture, Food and Rural Enterprise.  I am satisfied that many of the growth industries and businesses of the future  will be based in rural areas. Therefore, if the opportunity presents itself, we  have sufficient flexibility to direct training towards any areas in which we  believe growth will take place.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, we are looking closely at what options we can  produce with the colleges of further education. In their rapid response  programme to the economic downturn, they produced a whole suite of measures  that can be rolled out. I assure the Member that the situation regarding rural  areas is kept very much at the forefront of our minds. At the very highest  level, extra PhDs were sought three years ago, and extra money was received to  do that. I assure the Member that the agriculture sector was included in that  scheme, along with other STEM subjects that were referred to earlier by the  Minister of Education. We attach the highest priority to that sector.</p>

    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Debate resumed on motion:</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls on the Minister for Employment and  Learning to bring forward measures to ensure that more students from a  Protestant background are encouraged to opt for universities in Northern  Ireland as their first choice. <span class="Italic"><span style="font-size:10.0pt; ">&mdash;  [Mr Easton]</span></span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning (Sir Reg Empey)</strong>: I welcome the opportunity to speak  on this motion and I thank all of the Members who contributed to the debate. I  recognise that we have covered a lot of ground today, but I will try to address  as many of the points that were made during the debate as possible.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This subject has attracted a good deal of interest in the  Chamber and beyond. Higher education plays a very significant role in the  recovery of our economy and in Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s continued future growth prospects.  In this country, we must seek to secure a sustainable and globally competitive  economy. Members will be aware that, to achieve that, we must move from a  position that relies on low costs to compete to one that is based on higher  value-added products and services, innovation, creativity and high workforce  skills.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Increasing workforce skills and, in particular, increasing  the proportion of the workforce with higher education and intermediate level  skills will be key to achieving the objective of a competitive economy. During  their careers, those who have a degree level qualification will, on average,  earn 30% more than those with no qualifications. However, higher education is  about much more than just getting a degree or a well-paid job: it is about  personal fulfilment, forging new relationships and friendships, and developing  skills in preparation for the rest of one&rsquo;s adult life. Above all, it is about  investing in the future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In 2008, over 9,600 Northern   Ireland school leavers entered first year in higher  education institutions throughout the United Kingdom. Of those, 2,500  students chose to leave Northern Ireland  to study in Great Britain.  It has already been stated that 1,140 were Protestant and 1,060 were Catholic,  and the rest were of no, or other, religion. In addition, 1,025 Northern  Ireland domiciled students enrolled in higher education courses in the Republic  of Ireland&rsquo;s institutions, which is a decrease of 3% from 2007-08. However,  although no breakdown of the religious composition of that group is available,  it is fair to say that, anecdotally, a very high percentage of that group was  from the Catholic community.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A number of recent studies have challenged previously held  perceptions that young people are compelled to travel to study due to a lack of  higher education places in Northern Ireland,  or that more Protestants than Catholics choose to study in GB due to a  perceived chill factor for Protestants in Northern Ireland universities. I  will spend a wee bit of time on this issue because it goes to the heart of the  debate. There are a number of misconceptions that require addressing. The  Equality Commission&rsquo;s research update of May 2008 stated that some of the  factors that influenced educational migration included personal choice, level  of affluence and higher education policy. There is little recent evidence of  political chill factors impacting on educational migration.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Further to that, one of my early decisions as Minister was  to appoint Professor Bob Osborne to carry out some work in that area. Published  in 2008, his research indicated that 1&middot;5% of respondents felt that Queen&rsquo;s  University was not welcoming to the Catholic community, while 2&middot;9% felt that it  was not welcoming to the Protestant community. The University of Ulster&rsquo;s  figure for Protestants was 2&middot;6%. To all intents and purposes, the number of  students who felt that they faced a chill factor in those two institutions was  next to negligible. I would have preferred those readings to have been nil, but,  given the background, those figures are very convincing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">People must remember a number of things. In the 1998-2003  Executive, a ministerial predecessor of mine, Sean Farren, raised the maximum  student number cap by 1,000 places, which went some way towards dealing with  the insufficient provision. In his remarks, Mr O&rsquo;Loan hit the right tone,  because different factors are at play. If we increase the number of student  places, some individuals who would leave in the current circumstances may not  do so, because entry-level standards might be lower. On the other hand, the  evidence in Bob Osborne&rsquo;s report showed that a lot of people left because they  wanted to. The Department calls such people determined leavers. Happily, the  percentage of determined leavers is lower today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not doubt that Mr Craig&rsquo;s remarks about the situation  when he was at university may well have reflected the situation at that stage.  However, folks, circumstances have changed. Regardless of their religious  persuasion, young people do not see our institutions as a cold place.  Importantly, it should be pointed out that the number of people who are not  expressing any religious identification is also growing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The big thing that is being missed in the debate, although  it was touched upon by Mr O&rsquo;Loan, is the role of the Department of Education&rsquo;s  activities. The underlying problem is the failure to get a balance in  educational achievement in the community at a much earlier stage, well before  the point at which people come to university. That is the area to which we must  draw attention.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is no doubt that, in particular, Protestants from  secondary schools are far less likely to opt for higher education. The  statistics to prove that are there. However, the fault for that lies not with  universities but with the system at a much earlier stage, and there is no  question that that must be addressed. My Department can play a role through  various schemes, such as the University of Ulster&rsquo;s absolutely excellent  Step-Up programme, which I have been asked to extend; a request that I am  considering. That first class scheme involves the university engaging with  schools much earlier, so that young people know what to expect at university.  Step-Up is designed to reduce the number of dropouts and the shock to new  students.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To Members who asked what support my Department was  offering, the answer is a broad range, financial and other. Indeed, there are  people in my Department concentrating on widening access to universities here,  because that is what it is about. We understand that we have a problem, and  departmental staff are working on it full time to bring proposals to me. I have  engaged with those staff, and they know that my very clear view is that work  has to be done.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I must take issue with Mr Craig over one of his comments,  and I cannot let the debate close without dealing with it. He said that there  was nothing to attract a person from a Protestant background into our  universities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I cannot stand over that statement, which is totally  untrue. Our universities are much improved institutions, and they have a long  tradition of success. Indeed, Queen&rsquo;s University recently became a member of  the Russell Group of universities and, just before Christmas last year, was  named entrepreneurial university of the year for the United Kingdom. In the past five or  six years, the research assessment exercise (RAE) ratings for the University of Ulster  and Queen&rsquo;s University have dramatically improved both institutions&rsquo; positions  in the United Kingdom.  Mr Craig&rsquo;s statement is simply not true.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, in 2008, the research profile that the RAE  panel produced for history at Queen&rsquo;s University graded 60% of its research  activity as world leading or internationally excellent, and 95% as  internationally recognised or above. Similarly, in 2001, history at the University of Ulster was awarded a RAE rating of 4,  with 5 being the top mark achievable, and:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;This result  reflected the high quality of the publications of History staff and their  success rate with MPhil and doctoral students. Historians at the university  have always seen a thriving community of postgraduate students, both full-time  and part-time, as contributing to the overall research culture of the subject.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is evidence that, at both those levels, our  universities are doing extremely well.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In May 2008, in &lsquo;Educational Migration and Non-return in Northern Ireland&rsquo;,  a report prepared for the Equality Commission, it was stated:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Widening access, in  particular for boys and from the less affluent Protestant communities where  there is an under-representation in the numbers progressing to HE, would  increase numbers proceeding to HE who otherwise may not have considered this as  an option. Any initiative aimed at widening access would need to be based on  equality and thus not exclude individuals from either community.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It is clear, therefore, that this is a  cross-departmental issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As a result of the research that we have carried out, I can  tell the Member that the chill factor that may have existed 20 years ago is no  longer there. People choose to go to our universities for a vast number of reasons.  Having said that, I am acutely aware that many of our brightest people do  leave, and my Department has been doing what it can to get them back. We ran  the C&rsquo;mon Over campaign, and our roadshow has been to universities in Scotland and England. Indeed, the last roadshow  that I held, in early autumn, was in Dublin,  which was the one area to which we had not gone. We had to have a gap in the  roadshow programme owing to the economic recession, and, at the moment, I am  not able to continue with them because the employers whom I brought with me and  who had real jobs to offer students who came along no longer have those jobs. I  want to get everybody back, but we cannot hermetically seal people into Northern Ireland.  At the end of the day, people from a unionist background do not consider  themselves to be leaving anywhere. In their terms, they are simply moving to  another part of the country.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to do everything that I can, and since I have been  the Minister for Employment and Learning I have put a great deal of effort into  trying to grow the amount of money that goes into research in our universities,  because I believe that that will be the source of high-quality jobs in future.  From talking to students, I get the impression that the courses that are  offered, their own potential, and their long-term economic future determine  where they want to go. In addition, we were all young once, and anyone from the  greater Belfast area will know that, for many  people, going to the University   of Ulster or Queen&rsquo;s  University is just a matter of going up the road, which does not seem like  going away to university. Many young people want to get away for the full  student experience, and we cannot deny them that experience.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Nevertheless, there are things that we can do. We can make  a case for more student places, and I am looking at a number of proposals for  raising the number of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)  places. Indeed, there is a proposal on my desk from the University  of Ulster for Magee College,  and I know that we have been putting a great deal of effort into encouraging  people to study STEM subjects. However, looking at the myriad subjects from  which people want to be able to choose, no single university, or even two  universities, can offer everything.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Academia is a colossal area. On balance, the situation  today is radically different to the one that pertained a number of years ago.  We have an excellent higher education system, and I cannot detect a chill  factor. Evidence shows that there will always be the odd anecdotal case, but  racial issues, and others, can arise in any university, and we do not want  those any more than anybody else does. Generally speaking, we are on the right  track. However, the real problem lies further down the education spectrum. The  real reason why more Protestants are not coming forward is that fewer of them  are applying to university, because fewer of them are getting the relevant  qualifications at school. That is where the problem lies, and the real solution  to the problem lies there. We are taking steps to address that, and we will  continue to do so. We are looking at our proposals for widening access and,  undoubtedly, with respect to policy, there is no case to answer. Protestant  working-class students are under&shy;performing. I will not argue for one minute  about that, but, as far as we are concerned, there are right and wrong ways of  going about addressing that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I call Thomas Buchanan to conclude and make a winding-up speech. The Member has  10 minutes in which to speak.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  I thank my colleague for bringing the motion to the House, and I thank all  those Members who took part. The issue raised a bit of debate around the  Chamber. I want to point out from the start that the motion has not been  brought forward to exclude anyone from a university place, nor has it been  brought forward to seek to exclude people from attending universities outside Northern Ireland.  That has not been the reason for it. Some people have sought to politicise the  motion, but we are simply asking the Minister to look at the issue again and  put in place some sort of mechanism to encourage young Protestant students to  stay in Northern Ireland  and study at the universities here.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It used to be that many of our sixth formers were able to  find suitable employment and build careers without going to universities, which  usually meant that they stayed in Northern Ireland. However, today  most young people feel compelled to enter third-level education if they are to  have any chance of getting a foot on the employment ladder. Therefore, universities  play a more crucial role in society than ever before. During the Troubles,  Protestant students tended to prefer to study in universities in Great Britain.  They wanted to get out of troubled Northern Ireland, and few of them  returned. I suppose at that time we wished them well, but it was not good for Northern Ireland,  and it caused many of us to despair for the future. Thankfully, the Troubles  are, hopefully, behind us, but the problem remains that the exodus of  Protestant students still continues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In answer to a question that I tabled in October 2009, the  Education Minister provided me with some figures for the 2008-09 academic year,  the latest year for which figures are available. The figures reveal that 56% of  places in higher education in Northern    Ireland were taken up by Roman Catholics,  37% were taken up by Protestants, and 7% by others. That continuing imbalance  is not good. In fact, it is simply unacceptable.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Northern    Ireland moves out of its troubled past and  we have a much more peaceful society, we have to ask why Protestants are still  going across the water. There are several answers to that question. For  example, more Protestant students live in the east of the Province, and many of  them live within travelling distance to our local universities, yet they feel  the excitement of going across the water to study and to get a different  experience from studying here at home. However, there are other more worrying  reasons why they are leaving. Sadly, our local universities are still perceived  by many Protestants as being more welcoming to the nationalist community than  they are to the unionist community. For example, Queen&rsquo;s University &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I am deeply grateful to the Member for giving way,  as I appreciate that it is unusual to make an intervention during a Member&rsquo;s  winding-up speech. However, I must point out that the evidence from the 2008  report by Professor Osborne, which I sponsored, does not provide that  information. That is the point. The difference in perceptions and chill factors  between the various religions is 1%, 2% or 3%; it is extremely small. I ask the  Member to revisit that point if he would be so kind.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his intervention. However, let us be clear: not only  is the chill factor a concern in the Democratic Unionist Party, it is a concern  in the Minister&rsquo;s own party. His party colleague Tom Elliott said that he was  shocked to discover how many more Roman Catholics stay in the Province to  study, which suggests that there is a Protestant brain drain. That difficulty  and perception exists throughout the entire unionist community; it is not  focused only in the Democratic Unionist Party. The Assembly must be realistic  and look at that matter. Since the figures speak for themselves, I do not want  to repeat those that were cited in the debate. They will be available to  everyone in the Hansard report.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although local universities are perceived to be a cold  house for Protestants, there is no doubt that many seek to improve that image  and to be seen as a warm place for students from that community. That is to be  welcomed. Universities have a responsibility to take a long, hard look at how  they promote themselves to Protestants. The Assembly and the Executive must  take a proactive role on the matter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive have, quite rightly, placed the economy at  the heart of the Programme for Government. One of its key aims is to attract  high-value-added, well-paid jobs that will provide security and stability. If Northern Ireland  is to attract such jobs, it is vital that local graduates have the required  skills that are sought by potential foreign investors. If students cannot be  kept in Northern Ireland  and choose to go elsewhere, that will create a vacuum that is detrimental to  the economy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many Protestant students focus on STEM subjects &mdash; science,  technology, engineering and maths &mdash; which are key to the economy&rsquo;s development.  Closer working relationships between universities and colleges are needed. If  they were properly funded, colleges could take in students who drop out of STEM  subjects courses at Queen&rsquo;s University. The Assembly must look at that issue if  it wants to encourage students to stay in Northern Ireland. STEM subjects  provide a strong basis on which to mount a strong stay at home campaign in  schools and universities, particularly among Protestant sixth formers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to pick up on issues that were raised in the debate.  I am aware that time is moving on quickly. The proposer of the motion, Alex  Easton, spoke of the variation in the numbers of students in each of the  universities in Northern    Ireland. The figures, which are documented,  show that many more nationalists than Protestants study at Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  universities. The Assembly must deal with those stubborn facts.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As regards funding inequalities, 69% of Catholic students  receive information about funding compared with 55% of Protestant students, and  the Assembly must look at that issue to determine what can be done to provide  that information.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Leonard</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  My time is almost up. The proposer of the motion, Alex Easton, called for a  robust action plan to address that vital issue and to stop the perceived  discrimination of Protestant students that results in their moving away from Northern Ireland.  That is an issue that we have to look at.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have not got time to go into what the other Members who  spoke said, but I think that most of them admitted that there was a difficulty  and that a lot of Protestant students were leaving Northern Ireland and going to study  elsewhere. That fact was acknowledged by almost every Member who spoke, and it  is something that we need to address.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s response, and I agree with what he  said. We need to take a step back into the education system and further back  into our schools and, subsequently, our colleges. We need to start the process  there and build on it. That will help to alleviate the problems that we face  regarding our students in Northern    Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and negatived.</p>
    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="10"></a>Private Members&rsquo; Business</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Location of Public Sector Jobs</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to two hours for the debate. The  proposer will have 10 minutes to propose the motion and 10 minutes in which to  make a winding-up speech. All other Members who wish to speak will have five  minutes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes the significant social, regional  development, economic and long-term environmental benefits of a programme of  decentralisation of public sector jobs; calls on the Minister of Finance and  Personnel to reconsider his stated position on the implementation of the  independent review of policy on the location of public sector jobs; welcomes  the Minister&rsquo;s recognition that it requires an Executive decision; and calls on  the Executive to discuss the issue at their next meeting with a view to taking  immediate action to fully implement the review&rsquo;s recommendations by assessing  options for decentralising public sector jobs within all government Departments  and public sector agencies.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Minister to this afternoon&rsquo;s debate. I hope  that he will be able to respond to the debate and, considering the concerns,  rumours and goodnight Irenes that we have been hearing all afternoon, I hope  that that it will not be his last opportunity to respond to a debate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are talking about the review of policy on the location  of public sector jobs, which I will refer to as the Bain report. It has an  impressive set of authors. They consulted widely, and they carefully considered  conclusions that should be taken seriously. The Bain report cites three main  arguments for the redistribution of jobs, which are:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;first, to enhance the delivery of public services by  improving operational efficiency and effectiveness; second, to promote more  balanced regional economic development and reduce social deprivation; and  third, to promote sustainability by achieving environmental benefits through  changing commuter patterns, operating in more energy-efficient buildings, and  helping to revitalise the economic and social infrastructure of local  communities.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText" style="text-indent:0cm;">The SDLP agrees that those are  worthy goals.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We in the SDLP are particularly concerned at the spatial  imbalance of economic development and well-being across Northern Ireland.  Decentralisation is one of a number of investments that government can make to  redress the imbalance that has historically existed in Northern Ireland.  That can be addressed only through delivering strategic regional investment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the Minister and the House to give careful  consideration to the type of Northern    Ireland that we want to develop. Are we  satisfied that a large proportion of Northern Ireland has serious  infrastructural deficits, which lead to high unemployment and low wage  employment? If we do not invest, why should, and how can, the private sector  invest? Do we want to develop the entire region or just the subregions that  give the best short-term value for money return? Or, will we ensure that every  subregion in Northern    Ireland is developed? That would ensure that  every part of Northern    Ireland works for all of its people.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The relocation of public sector jobs can create a win-win  situation from social, environmental and economic perspectives. The Bain report  makes that point. It states:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;In France,  Finland, Ireland and the UK, relocation has been used to  create jobs and encourage economic development in provincial regions, while at  the same time reducing inflationary pressures in property and labour markets  close to capital cities.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a clear imbalance in development in Northern Ireland.  The Minister will be fully aware of the figures for employment and unemployment  across the North. The Minister will also be aware that the low levels of per  capita GDP, particularly in the west, result from complex reasons and  historical decisions and actions. Some of those relate to the sustained  campaign by the Provisional IRA against the economy and jobs, when businesses  and people were attacked. Some relate to historic Government decisions on  transport and university education in particular.</p>
    <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Dallat) in the Chair)</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a strong case for decentralisation to locations in  the west. The west is the main region of high unemployment outside any  reasonable travel-to-work distance from Belfast.  Therefore, for good, sound economic and justifiable reasons, it is a natural  region to which to relocate jobs. Derry is the major hub of the north-west,  which includes Strabane, which is also a town of very high employment but is  within easy reach of the city of Derry.  The Bain report is particularly clear on Derry&rsquo;s  position as a prime candidate for the relocation of jobs. The report states  that only Derry has the capacity to sustain  large grade-A offices of the type required for large-scale relocation. It is  well outside the Belfast  travel-to-work region, and it has a university campus, which means that it  would be able to supply suitably qualified staff in that locality. The west is  also geographically suitable for the location of cross-border bodies. The SDLP  agrees with the Bain report&rsquo;s recommendation that there should be a presumption  against new bodies being located in Belfast.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP understands that there are up-front costs &mdash;  relocation is not free &mdash; and it concurs with the Bain report&rsquo;s recommendation  that:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;any business-case process should ensure that the  long-term, non-monetary benefits receive primary consideration and should not  be determined by value-for-money considerations alone.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText" style="text-indent:0cm;">Judging by his previous comments,  the Minister of Finance and Personnel is clearly concerned about the cost  implications of decentralisation. However, it is not clear whether he supports  decentralisation in principle as a means of creating better balanced economic  development, environmental benefits and a better service provision. Perhaps the  Minister will comment on those three areas later.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As with many things, timing is crucial. It is rarely the  case that decisions are made when all stars are aligned. The SDLP recognises  the difficult economic circumstances that exist. Clearly, it would be better if  we were not in recession. However, we are conscious that there is an intention  to invest in upgrading public estates. We are going through the RPA process,  and new public bodies are being created. This is a period of change and  investment, and that is why it is crucial that the right location decisions are  made now. Once new systems become embedded and refurbishments are complete,  relocation for any Government will become much more difficult.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are key social, environmental and long-term economic  reasons for decentralisation. This is the right time to carry decentralisation  forward. I appeal to the House and the Executive to give serious consideration  to the Bain report&rsquo;s recommendations. The people of Northern   Ireland are watching us closely, and they want to know  whether the Executive will provide only caretaker subsistence investment in Northern Ireland or whether they have the  vision, strength, intelligence and leadership necessary to carry this and other  long-term initiatives to develop every region across Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There was concern when the Minister put a damper on  everyone&rsquo;s enthusiasm by saying that, for financial reasons, now was not the  time for decentralisation. We want to know whether the Minister believes that  he made the right decision.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many thousands of jobs have been haemorrhaged in the  north-west in recent times, so is now not the time to invest properly and for  good social and economic reasons? It is clear from the Bain report that:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Derry should be a  primary site for the relocation to absorb a substantial number of jobs in the&hellip;  short term.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText" style="text-indent:0cm;">The areas named for the relocation  of public sector jobs in the Bain report were Derry,  Omagh, Craigavon, Newry, Ballymena and Coleraine. Those are all areas of need,  and the Members who represent those constituencies will no doubt make that  point. The criteria set out by the Bain report include regional economic balance;  labour market capacity, which involves establishing whether there is a market  and whether the regions have the capacity to support the workforce; whether  those jobs can be made sustainable &mdash; and they can; whether those regions have  the transport or public transport infrastructure to develop on a theme of  decentralisation; and whether a clustering effect will create other employment  opportunities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We must know whether the Minister and his Department will  ensure that the Executive commission an independent report that will take data  from across Northern Ireland and bring key people together in order to inform  opinion. However, there is not much point in the Executive and the Department  constructing an independent report unless the areas that need to be challenged  and brought forward are prioritised. We must ensure that that report is  delivered on and that yet another position paper is not binned.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  I welcome the motion; I support it and will be voting for it. The issue of  decentralisation is not one that can be judged solely in the here and now. I,  too, was disappointed when the Minister indicated that his intention was  effectively to bin the Bain report, because decentralisation is a key factor in  investing in recovery, which is one of the key principles that the Executive  must address. I do not have any particular prescience about how the current  situation will resolve itself. However, for the purposes of the debate, I will  assume that there will be an Executive and an opportunity for us all to work  together to address that key priority, which was correctly identified in the  Programme for Government and the Budget.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The invest to save initiative that was identified by the  Minister during the debate on the draft expenditure plans for 2010-11 in  January is very interesting and progressive. Indeed, in my contribution to that  debate, I welcomed that initiative and congratulated the Minister on its  introduction, and I feel that the same concept could also be applied to  decentralisation. There would inevitably be short-term set-up costs, but there  have been remarkable and revolutionary developments in technology, particularly  communication technology.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are well-established and road-tested techniques in  remote working, working from home, hot-desking and the establishment of  satellite offices. Indeed, there have been some very interesting experiments in  the South, where shared service centres have been established to deal with the  consequences of the peripheralisation of the towns and cities that lie outside  the Pale and the Dublin  conurbation. That principle has been established and the effectiveness of the  approach demonstrated. It would, therefore, be short-sighted of the Executive  if they did not examine and bring forward pilot projects to demonstrate the  value of addressing the need to rebuild the economy, to identify the type of  economy that will sustain itself in future and to deal with the historical  legacy of underdevelopment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I make the point repeatedly that this is a tiny  geographical entity. There are no excuses for not providing equality of  opportunity or for not dealing with the legacy of disparity and  underdevelopment. It is not the fault of any party in the Assembly that those  patterns emerged. They have emerged over many decades, and our responsibility  is to try to do something about them. The Bain report, with its modest proposals,  provides an opportunity for us all to work together to begin to address those  issues that continue to affect our community and could well continue to do so  in the future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have sound economic reasons for taking action on the  Bain report. There are allied environmental reasons for reducing the number of  people on the roads, for reducing congestion to enhance the future development  of this city and for ensuring that we deliver effective government and services  cost-effectively. That does not mean sticking, in all circumstances, with the  old system and the old patterns of government deployment. It does not mean  ignoring, in a Luddite fashion, the developments in technology and commun&shy;ication.  We can deliver those services in a way that does not require people to get up  at the crack of dawn every day to commute to Belfast, do their day&rsquo;s work and  then commute back home again, with all the consequences that that brings, such  as cost, inefficiencies and stress for commuters.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is an opportunity here, and I exhort the Minister to  reconsider his position and to consider the benefits of working with his  Executive colleagues. Let us devise the pilot programmes and bring them  forward.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  To embark on an expensive scheme to decentralise civil and public service jobs  right across Northern Ireland &mdash; conservative estimates suggest that it would  lead to additional costs of some &pound;40 million &mdash; at a time when the Finance  Minister has asked Departments for &pound;370 million of expenditure cuts is really  not on. There are many things that we would like to do and which, in the  future, I trust we will have the opportunity to do. Implementing the Bain  report, either partially or in its entirety, may well be one of those things.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, as we debate the issue today, some of the  representatives of areas that could benefit from the report are trying to bring  the House down. This is not the time to do it. We have a fiscal duty to be  prudent and an overriding duty to maintain the House. We have a duty to be good  custodians of the public purse. At a time when we face the worst recession  since the 1930s, when unemployment has doubled in the last year, when 50% more  people are claiming jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance than were claiming it a year ago,  when we have an economic inactivity rate that is 30% higher than the national  average and when the cancellation and postponement of government and school  infrastructure and development projects have led to the loss of many  construction jobs, we find that some people stand accused today of a wrecking  exercise and are failing their electorate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some people &mdash; namely, the DUP&rsquo;s republican partners &mdash; set  policing and justice as a higher priority than what is, for other people, the  struggle of putting bread on the table and keeping a roof over their head. I  understand the intentions behind the motion and the frustrations of the  proposers, but, given ongoing events elsewhere, I ask Members to look around them.  Who is listening? What is the point in bringing business to the Floor of the  House when turmoil rules instead of democracy? When are we all going to say  that there should be no more pretend business until there is an established,  reliable and stable Executive who can secure public confidence? This  dysfunctional, squabbling, two-party coalition Executive is making a laughing  stock of the rest of us, and it really cannot continue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">No one is knocking my office door down to demand the  devolution of policing and justice powers as a top priority. They would want to  identify more with a debate such as this, and those who say anything different  are reading the public mood wrongly. The public want us to activate urgently  issues that are connected to job creation and protection. They want us to  determine how we might shore up the economy, which is already alarmingly  dependent on the public sector. They also want us to establish how we might  make things better for business and to find ways to protect the people who are  most in need of our help. They want action on all fronts; they do not want  distractions, such as those that are occurring today, from the priorities.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Bain&rsquo;s committee did not invent relocation; rather, its  report was a reaction to an idea that had been around for some time.  Decentralising government jobs is a politician&rsquo;s issue. At present, we should  be spending less time on that matter and more time on dealing with the issues  that are concerning people. We must handle those issues competently.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I would welcome areas in my constituency of Strangford  benefiting from relocation. As an Assembly, however, we must take a broader  view and discharge our financial duty properly in the interests of all. We have  got to put that in front of us all at a time when cuts are the order of the  day. It is more important to direct public money into front line services.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For those reasons, I cannot support the motion, and I ask  the cavalier republicans &mdash; a contradiction in terms &mdash; to please get a grip on  themselves and to listen to what people in the community want, rather than  throwing up garbage to the House today and perhaps for the next few days.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Before I call Dr Stephen Farry, I ask Members to stick to the  subject.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, as the horse bolts.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have some sympathy for the motion, and I am open-minded  on the issue in general. However, I am not entirely uncritical of it. I agree  with Mr McNarry that it is not valid to push the issue in the current context.  Each of the report&rsquo;s individual proposals on relocation would probably fail  under Treasury green book guidance, and, even if a political decision were  taken to override that and make a leap of faith, we would have to face up to  the fact that considerable costs would be involved in any decisions on  relocation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The debate comes in the context of some difficult economic  and financial circumstances. It would be difficult to implement the report&rsquo;s  proposals in any context but, in today&rsquo;s circumstances, that is an impossible  ask. If we were to do it, it would be at the opportunity cost of doing  something else, to use an economic concept on which the Finance Minister keeps  lecturing us.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Mr McNarry also referred to the financial cost of implementing the report&rsquo;s proposals.  The review of public administration also has a cost, yet we do not hear of that  being shelved on the basis of cost.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  do not necessarily disagree with the Member&rsquo;s point.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that we seek to prioritise our economic  resources for protecting and growing the economy and for protecting and  sustaining our public services. We must also bear in mind the sheer stress that  would be put on what is currently an overstretched public sector. We must be  responsible in what we ask for. During devolution and in recent years,  Departments have been asked to undergo considerable changes, some of which have  been productive and some of which have not. We must bear in mind how the system  can take the strain that has been asked of it. An extreme example is LPS, which  has been asked to implement a huge raft of changes in rating. It has struggled  to do so and is only now coming round to dealing with those issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I can certainly understand and identify with the argument  about the poor distribution of economic activity and wealth in Northern Ireland.  To some extent, that mirrors a wider point that I and others have made about  regional imbalances across the United    Kingdom, where three out of 12 of the NUTS  regions are net contributors to the Treasury. Against that, though, we have to  acknowledge the counter-argument about the tendency for jobs and economic  activity to cluster and to concentrate. We then have to ask ourselves whether  that clustering is benign or malign. Perhaps, when talking about the long-term  future of Northern Ireland,  we need to have a debate about whether there is enough balance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At times, I become a little concerned and frustrated  because our economic debates often become more about the internal distribution  of inward investment or jobs and about how the cake is distributed rather than  about the overall size of the cake and the creation of wealth. Ultimately, as  an Assembly, that has to be our main concern, and, in some senses, we will all  benefit if we manage to make some progress on that issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It should also be borne in mind that public sector jobs  are, in themselves, a poor substitute for private sector jobs. They do not  create wealth; rather, they exist to provide an important service in helping  the public with health and education, for example.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We should be somewhat concerned when we see a UK-wide  pattern in which the British Government are shifting a lot of public sector  jobs to the north of England  and to Scotland.  That becomes almost a surrogate for trying to create alternative forms of  economic activity in areas that have suffered from deindustrialisation over the  past 30 years. Therefore, let us have a balanced approach to job creation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The issue about the distribution of public sector jobs in  the greater Belfast  area was missed in the Bain report. Relocation was deemed to be about moving  jobs from the Stormont estate or Belfast city centre to other regions of  Northern Ireland and ignoring the suburban ring, where a critical mass of  people live. Many of those people commute to Stormont or to the centre of Belfast. It would be  beneficial to move jobs to that suburban ring. There is a myth that there are a  lot of Civil Service jobs in such areas, particularly in my constituency of  North Down. However, it is worth bearing in mind that there are actually very  few Civil Service jobs in North Down. A lot of civil servants who live there  have to commute, and, as a result, they clog up the traffic in the mornings at  the expense of other economic activities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have been lobbied about the location of public sector  jobs, and I was very conscious of a suggestion that was made several years ago  to move the headquarters of the Department of Education from Rathgael House to  somewhere in Belfast.  Even though that building is in an inferior state when compared to others,  there was a clear sense from those who work in it, particularly those in lower  grades, that they wanted to stay there because that is where they built their  livelihoods and that is where their families were located. They did not want to  have to relocate because of all the disruption that would have been involved.  Therefore, the interests of workers who are well settled in their jobs should  also be borne in mind. It is not in everyone&rsquo;s interests for jobs to be moved  around like pieces on a chessboard.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Given the surrounding circumstances, there is, as some Members pointed out, a  slightly surreal aspect to this debate. Perhaps what is most surreal for me is  that, during a debate about finance and personnel issues, I find myself largely  agreeing with Mr McNarry and Dr Farry. I do not know which of them should be  more worried.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr S Wilson)</strong>: You should be worried.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Maybe I should be deeply worried. I should maybe revise my speech completely. I  may disagree with a few of Mr McNarry&rsquo;s points; however, given the current  spirit of unionist unity, I will not pick up on them.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order, please. I did ask Members to stick to the motion and not to  decentralise to other subjects.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  shall try to centralise this debate and, indeed, my concerns about the motion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is no doubt about the sensitivity of the issue. We  would all admit that there are sensitivities in all parties because this is an issue  of geography more than anything else. Indeed, people from areas that could lose  jobs will be fiercely defensive of the status quo, while people from areas that  may gain jobs will have a strong desire for that movement to take place.  Therefore, I suspect that there are nuances of positions in all parties about  this issue, because, in many ways, it is a zero-sum game. It is not an issue of  introducing new jobs; rather, it is a question of potentially shifting jobs.  That is why the analogy with the RPA is awry. Although there may be some  question marks about the overall cost of the RPA, at least it is aimed at  saving money in the long run. At most, implementing the Bain report would  create expensive dislocation costs with no particular financial gain. There may  be gains and losses for individuals but, overall, there is no net financial  gain to Northern Ireland  as a whole.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As has been indicated, there are flawed assumptions behind  both the Bain report and this motion. The idea that shifting jobs to one location  means that there is a massive economic boost for the people in that area is  highly questionable. Belfast  is in second or third place as regards the number of public sector jobs per  head of population; interestingly, Omagh has the highest number. One might  think that having those jobs would be a massive boost to the Belfast  economy, yet, of the 20 most deprived wards in Northern   Ireland, 18 are in Belfast.  Therefore, wealth does not necessarily follow the location of public sector  jobs. Additionally, there is an assumption, fuelled by a parochial attitude,  that having jobs in their area will mean that people will have only to walk a  few hundred yards to their job, whereas, in reality, a much wider net is cast.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with Mr Farry that one of the flawed aspects of the  Bain report has been the attitude to greater Belfast. In the parochial attitude that I  have described, locations such as north Down and Rathgael House are lumped in  with Belfast.  If certain plans were implemented, there would be a danger that public sector  jobs would be taken away from north Down, where there is a deficit of jobs, and  transferred to the centre of Belfast.  That is one of the flaws of this motion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In many ways, Rathgael House is a good example. Many of the  staff there have sought transfers to work there, in order to take care of local  needs such as family responsibilities, care responsibilities and so on. We need  to take a more imaginative approach, encourage flexible working and see where  transfers can occur without the massive costs of relocation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Northern Ireland  is much smaller than other jurisdictions; it is not England,  Scotland, Wales or the Republic of Ireland,  and so issues of distance are not quite so crucial. Where relocation has been  attempted on a large scale, whether in Scotland  or the Republic   of Ireland, it has not  been an unalloyed success. In the Republic, things have largely ground to a  halt; in Scotland,  relocation has created major problems. Leaving aside the merits of relocation  as a concept, the fatal flaw in this motion and in moving ahead with Bain now  is affordability, given the current economic circumstances. We now have a  situation where Departments will have to give up a total of &pound;370 million in  revenue and capital. Therefore, at this time when there is added pressure on a  range of vital services, we cannot spend &pound;40 million on a dubious plan of  relocation.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member please bring his remarks to a close?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: It  would simply produce an additional burden, and that would be foolish.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  urge Members to vote against the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  &Eacute;ir&iacute;m chun taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt don r&uacute;n. I support the motion, and I welcome  the opportunity to speak in the debate. I thank the proposers for tabling it. I  welcome the motion&rsquo;s determination that the issue of decentralisation is for  the Executive to decide. It is not for the Minister of Finance and Personnel or  anyone else to decide unilaterally. I made that point when the Minister made  his ill-advised comments in October.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister talked about the cost of implementing the Bain  report. He said that the estimated cost of relocating 5,000 public sector jobs  as recommended by Bain &mdash; &pound;40 million &mdash; was not affordable. However, as my  colleague Mitchel McLaughlin pointed out last week, the Minister talked about  the concept of invest to save, whereby we spend in the short term &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Will the Member tell us what services she will cut to get that &pound;40 million?  Choices must be made. From where will the &pound;40 million come?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  I am talking about invest to save, whereby we spend in the short term. I do not  know whether the Member was present for the Minister&rsquo;s contribution. We would  benefit from that investment in the long term. I ask the Member, where is the  value for money in maintaining an imbalanced regional development? Where is the  value for money in maintaining what many regard as an ineffective top-heavy  Civil Service?</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I stress that this debate is not, as some Members commented  earlier, about Derry versus Belfast.  A balanced economy is good for the North as a whole, and the Finance Minister  should bear that in mind. He should also remember that the decision on whether  to implement the Bain report&rsquo;s recommendations will be taken by the Executive,  not him alone.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in supports the Bain review and its endorsement of  the argument that public sector jobs should be spread evenly across the Six  Counties. I know that the review was warmly received by the many civil servants  who live in rural communities and in places such as Derry and Newry and who  have to travel to Belfast  for work every day. Obviously, those important issues must be managed in a  sensitive manner for the benefit of public sector workers who may be affected  by decentralisation. The core argument of the Bain report is that public sector  employment should be part of a broader move towards a balanced approach to  regional and economic development across the North, and it is one that Sinn  F&eacute;in has long supported and advocated.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For its part, Sinn F&eacute;in will continue to approach the issue  on the basis of equality and of addressing historic regional disparities.  Indeed, Sinn F&eacute;in Ministers are actively seeking ways to decentralise Civil  Service jobs to areas outside Belfast.  It is well recognised &mdash; this has been demonstrated internationally &mdash; that the  relocation of public sector jobs gives a significant uplift to the local  economy in which they are situated. That is particularly true of areas such as  Derry &mdash; stand up for Derry; I could not go without saying that &mdash; which Pat  Ramsey and I represent, and which has suffered decades of neglect and  underinvestment. Perhaps that explains the determination by some parties to  defend the historic pattern of locating government jobs. I refer to the earlier  comments of Mr McNarry and to the fact that the DUP and the UUP have defended  other historical patterns, such as wanting unionism to be the largest party in  the Six Counties, but &ldquo;the times they are  a-changin&rdquo;. We witnessed some of that antipathy in the debate on whether to  declare the north-west as an area of special economic need. However, we will  not allow that to derail us.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Redressing regional inequality is not just the right thing  to do, it is a Programme for Government commitment, and my party has no  intention of letting up on its demand for that to be implemented. The  relocation of government jobs is just one tangible measure that the Executive  can and should take to help redress those inequalities, and I fully endorse the  demand for immediate Executive talks with a view to implementing the Bain  report in full. I support the motion and call on other Members to do so.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  I am pleased to speak on an issue that is of direct significance to my  constituency of East Londonderry. Its two  major towns are Coleraine and Limavady, which the Bain report suggests may  benefit from the decentralisation of public sector jobs. That will be of  tremendous benefit to many people throughout my constituency who commute daily  to Belfast and  other areas. Many people who live in other areas outside Belfast  are also forced to commute long distances each day because their Civil Service  jobs are based in Belfast.  Therefore, moving public sector jobs to locations outside Belfast would reduce many of those journeys  and alleviate the traffic problems that we encounter daily on the roads.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are, however, many more details in the proposals that  must be investigated. At a time when economic pressures are at the forefront of  everyone&rsquo;s minds, a scheme that may cost upwards of &pound;50 million cannot be  entered into lightly. A value-for-money principle must be uppermost in all our  minds. We cannot throw precious financial resources at the decentralisation of  Civil Service jobs without being sure that there will be a good return for that  investment. A huge number of issues in places such as Coleraine and Limavady  would benefit from the investment of a tiny proportion of that money.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Other areas such as Scotland  and the Republic   of Ireland have already  entered into a programme of decentralisation of public sector jobs. We must  examine and learn from the problems that those schemes faced. There is no point  in blindly following the proposals. We must study examples from other  countries, learn about the problems that they encountered and ensure that we do  not repeat their mistakes. The reason for comparing examples from elsewhere is  to evaluate the benefits and pitfalls. The greatest potential benefit lies in  locating new bodies in areas outside Belfast,  and we should focus on that. The further decentralisation of public sector jobs  should be examined in the future. That is important, because we must take into  account that the current financial situation demands caution. We must also  ensure that we achieve value for money from every penny that we spend.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I urge extreme caution in supporting the  motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  thank the Members who tabled the motion for bringing the topic forward for  discussion. I agree entirely that Northern   Ireland needs and deserves a public sector that is  efficient, fair and rooted throughout Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although we are content with the many positive aspects of  the Bain report, it is not perfect, and, therefore, I do not want it to be  implemented to be in full, as intimated in the motion. The report failed to  recognise inconsistencies in the current travel-to-work areas. A huge  geographic variation exists within those areas. Is that a good judgement on  which to base relocations?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My constituency of East Antrim  is ranked as one of the lowest of the 18 parliamentary constituencies when it  comes to public sector jobs, having only 2&middot;4%, or 5,171, of the 219,000 jobs  listed. That already low figure has decreased still further, with the  Department for Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) office in Larne being  earmarked for closure and relocation, changes happening in the Department for  Social Development (DSD), centralisation in north Belfast, and a new processing office has  opened in Ballymena.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Page 58 of the Bain report states that councils in East Antrim have among the lowest number of public sector  jobs per 100 of the working age population. Larne has only 8 public sector jobs  for every 100 of the working age population, Carrickfergus has 8&middot;2, and Newtownabbey has 10&middot;3. Those figures compare with 35&middot;6  public sector jobs in Belfast for every 100 of  the working age population, 21&middot;8 in Omagh and 19&middot;2 in Londonderry.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Other areas are similarly affected. For example, the Ards  council area has 8&middot;5 public sector jobs for every 100 people. Again, the issue  of huge variations within each travel-to-work area was not addressed by the  review. It is not only an issue for areas west of the Bann, as some of the  issues also affect areas in the east of the Province.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members have failed to grasp the cost implication. It is  easy to say that we should use money from the invest to save fund. However, to  have money for that fund, a choice must be made to take it from other projects.  I would wish for money to be diverted from other projects only if the long-term  economic benefits were certain. Money should not be moved from one area merely  for the luxury of re-juggling where civil servants are located.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  I invited Members to consider an extremely worthwhile concept. I was not  talking about redeploying the budget that has already been earmarked for a  range of projects, all of which I support. I was merely recommending the concept.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  All Members ought to know the severity of the finance proposals contained  within the recent announcement. We have to save &pound;370 million, and, for the  Health Service alone, that amounts to &pound;113,000 of additional savings in the  next financial year. However, proposals to relocate Civil Service jobs would  incur an additional cost. How would that be paid for?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On Friday, I met the chief executive of the Northern Health  and Social Care Trust. I learned of the huge pressures facing that trust  because of the increasing birth rate in the area. At the same time, the elderly  population is increasing. Both place considerable demands on the Health Service  and require particular resources. In addition, hospital outpatient referrals  are up by 7% this year and attendance at accident and emergency departments is  up by 8%. A decision to relocate civil service jobs means deciding not to  provide money to front line services, and we must be careful that that does not  happen.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When the Bain report was published, the Ulster Unionist  Party gave guarded support to many of its recommendations. We noted that the  relocation of public sector jobs would help to create a better and more  balanced regional economy, encourage wealth creation and reduce economic  disparity. However, we also stipulated that the Executive would have to ensure  that value for money was at the forefront of any decisions that they took.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  It strikes me that that has not been the practice thus far. For example, how  can the Member explain away the appointment of four victims&rsquo; commissioners?  Where will the &pound;118 million cost of the review of public administration be  found?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: It  is for others to argue why there are four victims&rsquo; commissioners instead of  one.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The review of public administration and the reviews of  other Departments and organisations present an opportunity to look at  relocation where there are minimal set-up costs and where efficiencies can be  shown. We must take great care when moving entire Departments and structures en  masse. We must be careful to make sure that such moves will produce savings and  that a new work arrangement will kick in at the same time. Such moves must be  carefully planned so that savings are made, thus enabling reinvestment for the  future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We ought to learn from the Republic of Ireland&rsquo;s  painful experiences of job relocation: huge expense and considerable upheaval  of services. As other Members said, the Scottish Executive have had virtually  to reverse their decentralisation policy and give increased weight to value for  money.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The last thing that the Assembly should be doing is wasting  taxpayers&rsquo; money or heaping any more pressure on our already creaking public  services. We must ensure that any changes are carefully thought out and bring  short-term financial rewards.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  This is the second time that the location of public sector jobs has been  debated in the Chamber. After the Bain report was first published a couple of  years ago, I proposed a motion on the location of public sector jobs. I am  delighted that there is an opportunity to remind the Executive of the  importance of taking the initiative forward. The previous SDLP motion was  inspired by our desire to see equal opportunity and fair treatment for people  everywhere in Northern    Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not want to go over history, but the clear evidence of  the economic neglect of the west has not been properly identified. Everyone  would agree that economic neglect leads to a lack of economic opportunity,  which can cause social deprivation and other problems. We all have a  responsibility to address those problems.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I agreed with David McNarry when he talked about the mood  and atmosphere in the Chamber. The topic that we are discussing is crucial to  people everywhere, who want to see the Executive deliver. The number of empty  seats in the Chamber is a statement in itself.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I did not agree with David McNarry and other Members who  asked where the money will come from for the decentralisation of public sector  jobs. The failure to tackle social deprivation and all the resultant issues,  and their effect on our society, means that we simply cannot afford to do  nothing. As Members know, six towns were identified in the Bain report, and I  welcome its recommendations for those towns. However, three other towns &mdash;  Cookstown, Downpatrick and Enniskillen &mdash; were mentioned in the Bain report as  having the potential to share in the relocation of public sector jobs; they  should not be forgotten.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those places had problems with infrastructure, which Bain  recommended should be tackled first. The infrastructure in those three towns,  spread out as they are, should be addressed. The infrastructure was said to be  weak, and I forget the exact wording that was used about Enniskillen, which is  in my constituency. It is the most westerly town that is identified and should  not be set aside or allowed to fall out of the Bain recommendations.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Various Departments have responsibilities for Enniskillen.  The roads infrastructure must be improved because there is no railway system.  It seems that the small airport there will never be developed because no  investment has been provided. Therefore, it is important that the Executive not  only take on board the importance of implementing proposals in the six towns  that are mentioned in Bain but take responsibility to tackle the  infrastructural shortcomings in the other three towns, for which investment  will be required.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I mentioned the importance of investment in roads in the  west. However, the Department of Finance and Personnel is currently consulting  on a massive cut to the roads budget. It is not good enough that people in the  west are not included in the recommendations of the Bain report, and it will  certainly not be good enough if the Executive fail to provide the investment to  improve the infrastructure, as was highlighted in the report and on many  previous occasions. The Department of Finance and Personnel and the Department  for Regional Development have responsibilities.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should bring his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  All our government bodies and the Executive face challenges. They should be  taken seriously, and we need some action to address the shortcomings.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I support the motion, which is  important at this time. We have been told that the cost of around &pound;40 million  is causing problems. We must consider how the business case is put together and  on what it is based. What questions do we need to ask to get an answer?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Professor Bain issued an explicit health warning and  explained the limitations of the indicative costs modelling that was undertaken  as part of the review. He pointed out that significant political will is  required to implement relocation because of the acute cost benefits that were  forecast. Moreover, he considered the issues around long-term social and  economic benefits, which must be factored in and will form an important part of  the consideration of relocation. Cost is not the only issue. The current  structure works within certain parameters, which may need to be reviewed and  changed as we progress.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">People in public sector jobs have been surveyed. Stephen  Farry said that people in those jobs do not want to move. However, other people  want to move into such jobs but cannot do so because they are not available in  their area. They do not want to travel on the M1 or M2 every morning to work in  Belfast. They  want to work in local towns and villages. Relocation to rural areas is an  important part of that process and will ensure that those people have the opportunity  to take up some of those jobs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It does not make sense that the Department of Agriculture  and Rural Development is based in Dundonald House in east Belfast. It could be relocated to the Loughry  campus of CAFRE, where there are many empty buildings and many acres of ground  to build on. Moreover, a section of the Forest Service could be relocated.  People from Enniskillen travel to Dundonald House to make decisions about  forestry around the country.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I support the Member on that issue. In whose gift is it to make the decision to  relocate those jobs? Can the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development make  that decision, or would she have to rely on money from the Minister of Finance  and Personnel?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>: I  will repeat what my colleague Martina Anderson said; it is an Executive  decision. The Minister has said in the past that she would be interested in  relocating jobs if the Executive made the decision and provided the necessary  resources. During and after her pregnancy, she worked from an office at  Loughry, so she was able to decentralise in that way. Parts of Departments  could be relocated, creating new employment and new opportunities, instead of  being based in expensive rented Belfast  city centre offices that are owned by developers and Departments alike.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Look at what happens on the M1 every morning and every  evening to people who commute in and out of Belfast. We should look at other  opportunities. Members ask where the savings would be made. Why not wind up a  lot of the quangos and bring their functions under direct ministerial control  where they would be more accountable? Services such as roads and water have  been centralised, and health is being centralised in the Royal  Victoria Hospital  in Belfast  while local areas are losing out on hospitals. We must look at that situation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Discrimination west of the Bann was a very blunt instrument  that affected everyone. I heard George Robinson say that his constituency could  do with jobs being relocated there. Everyone west of the Bann was discriminated  against because they were denied services, infrastructure, businesses and  industry. All those issues must be rectified if the Assembly is going to  deliver anything for the people. Let us bring the quangos back under the  control of Departments, promote the idea that we are interested in preserving  our social fabric, and deal with the community cost of providing jobs in places  to which people do not have to travel long distances every morning. We must  deal with the perception that discrimination still exists west of the Bann.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  I welcome the thrust of the motion and the debate, although, given the wording  of the motion, there are issues to which I take exception. I know that, having  spoken privately to the Minister of Finance and Personnel, he is very excited  and very positively disposed towards the issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">People would be mad not to recognise that, as constituency  representatives, we want as many good opportunities as possible to flow to our  areas. The motion allows for a genuine and detailed debate on that issue. The  debate is not and should not be seen as a whinging session during which Members  make demands for their constituencies and ignore everyone else. There is merit  in the motion and the debate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We should remember that the Bain review was commissioned by  the then Minister of Finance and Personnel, now the First Minister, Peter  Robinson, who encouraged out-of-the-box thinking whereby people would be tasked  to examine opportunities to develop the location of public sector jobs outside  the main cities of our Province. Those of us who represent largely rural  constituencies see great vitality and opportunity for such projects to go  forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, we would be kidding ourselves if we were not alive  to the economic climate in which the new Minister of Finance and Personnel  finds himself. That economic climate has, to a degree, unfortunately curtailed  the ambition of the Bain proposals, largely because the money is not there to  relocate many of those posts; neither is there the opportunity, given that  public sector jobs will be put under significant pressure over the next year.  If there is a new Government at Westminster,  that pressure will be greater than people here have given proper thought to. Therefore,  we have to recognise the tightening-of-the-belt situation that we are in.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, opportunities still exist that should not be lost.  It has been proposed that opportunities be developed in Ballymena, which is in  my constituency. I would like to see that happen. Ballymena acts as a hub for  Coleraine at one end of the constituency and as an employment hub for Larne and  Carrickfergus at the other. The areas that were identified in the Bain report  should be considered whenever an opportunity for such hubs to be built arises  or for public sector jobs to be located or created.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The previous Member to speak, Mr Molloy, who is a Member  for Mid Ulster, made valid points about DARD. Most people from the rural  community who have to interface with DARD would like to see people in that  Department employed in the rural community and in parts of Northern Ireland  that are much more accessible than east Belfast. That does not do violence to  anyone&rsquo;s current position or to the standing of the Department. Dundonald House  is a building that is, quite frankly, not fit for purpose, and if the Minister  of Agriculture and Rural Development found that she wanted to close it, or if  the Executive wanted to remodel or rebuild it, there would be considerable merit  in locating what is one of the largest Departments to an area that is easier to  access by those who use it most, namely, the rural community and farming  sector. Therefore, various opportunities exist.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Opportunities also exist through the creation of, for  example, the new Charity Commission and the Commission for Victims and  Survivors. Those bodies provide opportunities for people in public sector  employment to be relocated or newly located. I hope that those issues are not  lost on the Minister or the Department when they look at the motion, and I hope  that they see it as promoting a concept that could, under better economic  circumstances, be given a fair wind and some encouragement.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>: I  welcome the debate, and I congratulate the Members for securing it. Given that  I will talk about the Craigavon Borough Council area, I declare an interest as  a member of that council.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The decentralisation of public sector jobs has a role to  play in securing the economic stability of our Province. Understandably, Belfast is the central  location for public sector jobs. However, that means that many people have to  travel far and wide to maintain their employment. There is no real call for  that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I accept the assertion in the motion that the  implementation of the Bain report would, in some shape or form, have  significant social, regional and economic benefits now and in the future. Take,  for example, Craigavon, which is in the centre of my Upper   Bann constituency. As many people know, Craigavon was planned as a  large urban and suburban conurbation that was designed to encourage people to  move away from Belfast,  ensuring a more even distribution of development. Many people also know that  difficulties ensued, with the major employers in the area, such as Goodyear,  failing to make regular profits. Those companies had to close, making many in  the area redundant. That situation was compounded by the Troubles, which served  only to stunt Craigavon&rsquo;s growth.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Craigavon still remains, and it is an important area that  is thriving. The Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency classifies  Craigavon as a large town, and the 2001 census showed that there were 81,000  people in the area. With a census due next year, I would suggest that there are  many more than 90,000 people in Craigavon. Lurgan and Portadown are the main  towns in the Craigavon urban area, and the area now extends to Banbridge and  Lisburn on one side and to Dungannon on the other. Bearing that in mind, I  contend that the Craigavon area is ripe for an influx of public sector jobs.  That said, however, I can hope, wish and lobby for jobs to come to the  Craigavon area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The reality is that it will not happen in the current  financial climate. With the public purse pinched like never before, it is  abundantly clear that the finances and other necessary instruments are not  there to allow the Bain report to progress to the implementation stage. We must  ensure value for money at all times, and that does not currently seem to be  apparent. I hope that the situation will change.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am unable to support the motion but call on the Executive  to maintain a watching brief on the matter. The Craigavon area is ripe for  growth. We can only hope that the Executive can distribute those jobs in a more  even fashion, which would help stimulate what we intended to do in Craigavon a  number of years ago.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McHugh</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. There appears to be a fairly  normal divide on this issue, which is to be expected: people are picking their  spots. I support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Rural constituencies sometimes suffer a double whammy of  decentralisation in the wrong direction. We see jobs going to Belfast and  Omagh, for example, because some people cannot look further than the border of  Fermanagh and see it as land&rsquo;s end from a Northern point of view. There is  duplication of many jobs, from Carrick-on-Shannon back to Enniskillen and  Omagh. The loss of revenue and the cost of that has not been looked at on a  cross-border basis, and that is also part of the debate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During the debate, many Members, some of whom support the  motion, have explained the cost of implementing the review and said that that  is the reason why we cannot look at this now. It is more about mindsets than  about whether it can be done. This is at least the second time that we have  debated the subject.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I know about Rathgael House. Stephen Farry said that people  from the greater Belfast  area are defending their positions in the sometimes cosseted comfort zone of  Belfast. When they look to the outback, which to them is anywhere beyond the M1,  there is the belief that they would need a work visa to go to somewhere like  Fermanagh. That is where we are with the Civil Service, and it leaves us in a  difficult situation that is made more difficult through the new phenomenon of  equality of service, let alone equality of jobs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have to deal with call centres that offer the option of  pressing 1, 2, 3, or 4 to answer a call. One cannot deal with actual people  unless one gets in the car and drives to Belfast.  People in Belfast  can go directly to those offices and meet people to discuss issues; we do not  have that benefit. Anyone in rural areas will find that those services are not  as good as they have been, and that they cannot talk to a real person in order  to resolve various issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The issue of equality of jobs is a big one, and there is no  balance. If someone were to be promoted in Fermanagh, in agriculture for  example, a person offered a grade three position must take it up in Belfast. If they do not,  they will never see that promotion go beyond the paper stage in their working  life. If they want to live in Fermanagh, they will never be promoted beyond  grade two. There is dislocation from areas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members have agreed that the concept should be  agreeable to everyone. It is ironic that this same debate has taken place in  the D&aacute;il, and the cross-party divide on the issue is exactly the same as in  this place. Only one of every two MLAs represents a rural area. We are  outnumbered, and we will always lose the debate, however long it goes on. It is  about propping up Belfast or Dublin. All the buildings occupied by the  Civil Service will be kept, because it feels comfortable. Similarly, the six  major hospitals are in and around Belfast.  Members from cities such as Derry have argued  in favour of the motion. It is ironic that people who should agree are arguing  the same points but only from their own positions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">People from rural areas will always have difficulty getting  through to those in ivory towers. People in the Civil Service have built up  their ivory towers over long periods of time. Agriculture and education have  been mentioned in the debate. Indeed, it was too much to ask even for the  Department of Education to move its headquarters from Rathgael House in Bangor to Belfast  city centre.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to draw his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McHugh</strong>: I  hope that progress will be made over time, because cost is not the only issue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The Member for North Antrim Mr Paisley Jnr, who has  now left the Chamber, started his speech by saying that I was excited by the  prospect of the debate. I must say that I am neither excited nor not excited,  but, given the attendance, it seems quite clear that the House is not excited  by the debate. Of course, we all know why that is the case.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member for Strangford made the point that some of the  Members who have talked most vociferously about the importance of addressing  this issue are far more interested in grandstanding and creating instability in  Northern Ireland  through their tactics in the discussions on the devolution of policing and  justice. I do not think that the Northern Ireland population is  overly excited about that issue either, yet it seems to have become an  obsession for some Members, to the extent that it may well put what we have  here at considerable risk.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members have asked me to be straightforward and honest and  to give clear answers. The proposer of the motion was one of those who made  that request, but, as he well knows, I never do anything else. I will look at  some of the issues that have been raised and address them in a straightforward  way.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many Members, mostly those on the other side of the House,  expressed the view that economic benefits need to be spread across Northern Ireland.  Neither I nor the Executive disagree with that. However, the impression has  been given here today that the Bain report&rsquo;s modest proposals for the  relocation, not creation, of some 3,000 jobs will somehow dramatically change  the distribution of economic activity in Northern Ireland. If the Members  who put forward that argument thought about it, they would realise just how  shallow and paper-thin it is.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The main driver for the spread of economic benefit is the  massive programme of investment &mdash; &pound;1&middot;7 billion of capital investment, for  example &mdash; that is undertaken every year as a result of Executive decisions.  Consider, for example, the amount of money that DRD is spending to improve  infrastructure in the north-west. Over the next 10 years, &pound;800 million will be  invested in infrastructure to the benefit of the north-west. That kind of  investment is likely to draw even more investment from the private sector and  elsewhere. If we want to deal with the problem of economic inequality across Northern Ireland,  perhaps we should focus attention on that rather than on the Bain report.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It struck me as odd that Members call for more public  sector jobs to be relocated to rather than created in their areas. I do not  know whether they have ever listened to anything that I have said in this House  or whether they ever read the newspapers, but the jobs that will be under  threat in the forthcoming years are the very ones that they are asking to have  relocated to their areas. For the next 10 years in the United Kingdom,  we will face economic pressures that will be directed increasingly towards the  public sector as we try to reduce its debt and borrowing. If ever there were a  loser to be backed, it is investing in public sector jobs in the areas about  which Members have spoken.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There have been some very odd allies in this debate,  particularly Mr McNarry and Mr Farry. I begin to get worried when I find that I  am lined up with those people. Mr Farry made a very important point: if we have  &pound;40 million to spend, we ought to spend it on jobs that will create wealth and  have spin-off effects, not on the area of the economy that is relocating.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Molloy and members of the SDLP made great play of the  commitment of their parties to spreading economic benefits across Northern Ireland.  I will talk about their Ministers in a minute or two, but what do their parties  do? Do we find that, in the interest of spreading economic benefits, they  locate their party headquarters in Londonderry,  Enniskillen or Omagh? Not at all. The SDLP&rsquo;s party headquarters is in rich  south Belfast.  It is right in the city centre, presumably because that is handy. Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s  party headquarters is in west Belfast.  It is significant that, even though this is an SDLP motion that is supported by  Sinn F&eacute;in, those parties have kept their Belfast  representatives and their greater Belfast  representatives strangely silent. It is because they know that there is an  inconsistency in the approach. Their parties make decisions in certain ways  that are reflected in where they locate their headquarters and, therefore, in  the staff who are associated with those headquarters.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Molloy and other Sinn F&eacute;in Members talked about their  party&rsquo;s commitment to spreading economic benefits, yet he mentioned the  Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD). Mr Beggs from East Antrim pointed out that, when the Agriculture  Minister looked for efficiencies, she centralised DARD jobs. My constituency  and the town of Larne  lost jobs because of DARD&rsquo;s centralisation. Dundonald House was mentioned. If  the Minister wishes to relocate those jobs, it is up to her to bring forward  proposals and to present a business case. As far as I am aware, no such  business case has been made. No such decision has been made because she knows  that she has to live within a certain budget and, to do that, there are certain  realities that she has to face.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A row has been going on around the countryside because the  Social Development Minister has looked at benefit offices and decided to  relocate jobs. Indeed, the decentralising Minister from that decentralising  party has moved those jobs from Larne to Corporation Street in Belfast. The parties opposite say that they  are all for decentralisation, but, when it comes down to the nitty-gritty of  making the economic decisions, their stance is no different to the stance that  I have adopted.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, we are told that there are vast economic  benefits. I am glad that some Members have said that they welcome my important  proposals for an invest to save fund that will enable us to save money in the  future. However, to think that the invest to save proposals are applicable to  the relocation of public sector jobs indicates that the Members who talk about  the fund either do not understand what it is for or have not read Bain.  Investing to save means that we spend money now in order to make savings in the  future. Bain said the following about the relocation of jobs:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Accurate cost benefit and value-for-money assessments  will be difficult&rdquo;,</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">if not impossible, to prove. Therefore, when it comes to an  invest to save proposal, Professor Bain has said that it would be impossible to  generate those figures. In fact, he indicated that:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;relocations require up-front investment and are  unlikely to produce financial benefits in the short term.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When I announced invest to save, Members asked me what my  criteria would be. The aim was to ensure that savings were maximised and made  as quickly as possible. So, even on the basis of the report that Members want  to debate in the House today, applying invest to save proposals is very  unlikely.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members on this side of the House have pointed out that no  Member has indicated how to find the money to be spent on relocating jobs. The  closest we got to it was Mr Gallagher. He did not identify where the money  might come from, but his answer was &mdash; I am growing sick and tired of these kind  of answers in the House &mdash; that we simply cannot afford not to do something.  What kind of an answer is that? It is all about a challenge, and the challenge  is this: if he wants to spend &pound;40 million, tell us where it will be taken from.  That is the harsh reality.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not want to prattle on about opportunity costs,  because I mention it nearly every time I speak in the House. However, it seems  that Members still wilfully ignore the fact that money cannot be spent on one thing  without taking it off something else. Choices must be made. That is not a  value-for-money consideration. That is why Professor Bain couched it in terms  of there having to be a political will. In other words, one must look beyond  the economics to a political decision.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At this time of tight constraints on finance, we do not  have the money to meet all the demands being made by Ministers and Members and  to be made when we debate the Budget in a month&rsquo;s time, if we ever get that  far. Are Members seriously telling me to ignore value-for-money considerations  and throw aside the Government green book on public spending in favour of  spending on this because it is good for us to have a debate and to tell our  constituents that we are fighting to get public sector jobs relocated to their  town? That is what is being asked.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Other jurisdictions that started with the high ideals of  wanting to relocate public sector jobs have, in the face of the hard economic  reality that they have encountered in public finances, shelved their projects or  gone back to value-for-money considerations. Indeed, when the matter was last  debated, the Assembly&rsquo;s wish was that the decision should be based on  value-for-money considerations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members asked about some of the other things that the  Executive are spending money on, including RPA. There are up-front costs  associated with RPA, but there are also quantifiable benefits, which are well  in excess of the costs. I accept that many of the Executive&rsquo;s past decisions  probably did not produce value for money, and I will not try to defend them on  that basis. With hindsight, perhaps we should not have made those decisions,  but, in the current economic circumstances, does that mean that we should go on  making wrong decisions?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The next argument was for the environmental benefits;  people will travel less. The truth of the matter is &mdash; even Professor Bain  pointed this out &mdash; only 264 people travel every day from Londonderry.  If we relocated an office to Londonderry, is  it likely that all those 264 people would be employed in it? The answer is no,  because their skills and qualifications, the Department in which they work and  their ability to move from one job to another would not allow 100% of them to  move to whatever office may be located in Londonderry. Indeed, you would  probably find that just as many people who currently live in Belfast  would simply travel to Londonderry. I must  inform Members that burning petrol coming from Londonderry to Belfast produces  the same carbon footprint &mdash; something with which everyone in the House knows I  am well acquainted &mdash; as coming from Belfast to Londonderry, so there would be  no environmental advantage. Likewise, sitting in a line of traffic in one  direction is the same as sitting in congestion in the other. Let us not  presume, therefore, that there would be environmental benefits.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The next point that was made was that it is an Executive  decision. I am not passing the buck: at the end of the day, it is an Executive  decision, and it will not be made by me as the Finance Minister. I just happen  to have stuck my neck out and given my view on the matter, but do not forget  that the Members who protested that it is an Executive decision all have  Ministers from their parties in the Executive. Within a couple of months of the  matter first being debated in the Assembly, Nigel Dodds took a report to the  Executive. In October 2009, I again took a report to the Executive. Neither of  those reports has been acted on, so maybe the Members who said that it is an  Executive decision should ask their respective Executive Ministers why they  have not acted on the reports from two DUP Finance Ministers, one of whom is a  sceptic. I suspect that it is because they know that the underlying economic  reality would present difficulties. Why have Executive Ministers whose parties  we are told are so tied to the principle not brought forward proposals for  decentralisation? Indeed, as I said, some of those Members&rsquo; proposals would  actually entail centralisation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many people will recognise that there is a myth around this  subject. I listened to Mr McHugh, who spoke about a mindset of protecting Belfast. If he had taken  the time to read the Bain report, he would have found that 60% of public sector  jobs are located in the greater Belfast  area. That is not totally out of sync with the proportion of the Northern Ireland population in the greater Belfast area, which is  52%. Therefore, the idea that there is massive skewing is wrong.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There were allegations that the west of the Province is  badly done by, but, if one looks at the distribution of public sector jobs per  100 of the working population, the highest proportion is not in Belfast; it is in Omagh.  The last time that I looked at a map, Omagh was west of the Bann. Furthermore,  Londonderry has the third-highest proportion, at 17&middot;2%, and, as far as I know,  Londonderry is located in the west of Northern Ireland. Therefore, of the  top three locations, two are located west of the Bann.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Please draw your remarks to a close, Minister.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I believe that this debate will go on. I have sought  honestly today to look at the arguments that have been made, but I believe that  many of them are shallow. Therefore, I ask Members to reject the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  Two lines of poetry by Wilfred Owen have kept recurring to me all afternoon:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;O what made fatuous sunbeams toil</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">To break earth&rsquo;s sleep at all?&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Those words were written amid the carnage and  mayhem of the First World War, and it is almost sacrilegious to quote them in  relation to the more minor mayhem that is going on around us. Nonetheless, they  kept recurring to me because they seemed appropriate. As some of us try to do  something workmanlike inside the Chamber, there are others outside it who,  without good reason, are quite prepared to pull down the structures by which we  are governed. I even find elements of mayhem around the motion and the issues  that it addresses. What is the point of commissioning, at considerable expense,  a 200-page report on an issue and then, as one Member put it, binning it? I do  not think that that indicates a strategic direction on the part of the  Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">David McNarry talked about the Assembly doing real things.  I tried to intervene, but he would not take an intervention. Nevertheless, I  wanted to ask him whether he rejects the issue of parades and the Parades  Commission being brought into a discussion of how we are governed here. Does he  reject that absolutely and say that we should concentrate on the things that  are actually of some importance?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the wholehearted support from some Members and  the more guarded support from others. Throughout my contribution, I may omit  many comments that Members made, but I will try to do justice to most of them,  because valuable comments were made. I thank Mitchel McLaughlin, Martina  Anderson, George Robinson to some degree, Ian Paisley Jnr, Gerry McHugh and  others who supported the motion. At one point, I was going to include George  Savage in that list, but he and Roy Beggs seemed to be saying that the delivery  of the Bain report is absolutely essential but then saying that it cannot and  should not be done. That is not an example of great political leadership.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The chairman&rsquo;s foreword to the report states:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;We were established in December 2007 as an  independent review to put forward &lsquo;an agenda for action&rsquo; and &lsquo;a set of  practical recommendations for the longer-term approach to the location of  public sector jobs&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">They were given the instruction to put forward an  agenda for action, and it was the former Minister of Finance, Peter Robinson,  who issued that instruction. I still think that Peter Robinson is committed to  the issue. I note an answer that he gave to my colleague Pat Ramsey on 21  January 2008:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;There are real advantages for Northern Ireland if we  can have a fair distribution of jobs around the Province, with reduced pressure  on our infrastructure if jobs are close to people rather than bringing people  along our roads to jobs. If we can grow the economy, particularly in the areas  that we are pressing for &mdash; financial services, business services, and computer  technology &mdash; those jobs are more likely to come to the greater Belfast area.  Therefore, it becomes all the more important that we look at the jobs where we  have a greater control of location and consider their displacement to other  areas of the Province.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; ">I thank Peter  Robinson for his support.</span></p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I could quote at length the report&rsquo;s actual contents and  recommendations, which are not given enough consideration. Often, quite a few  of its early recommend&shy;ations are not even discussed, such as flexible working;  a network of regional satellite offices; an information and communications  technology strategy for flexible working; a network of touchdown office space  on the Stormont estate for flexible use by officials; policies on remote  working and homeworking as a matter of urgency; and wider use of telephone,  video and web conferencing. Those are not grand, dramatic proposals, which the  report has avoided. It suggests phasing them in over a five-year period.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members are aware that six hub towns were identified, with  the possibility of three others being added in the longer term. The report  proposes that there should be a presumption against locating in Belfast when establishing  new public sector bodies. It states that new bodies should be candidates for  relocation, which should be considered with regard to operational/processing  units, common services organisations and cross-border bodies. Another  recommendation is that relocation should be considered in the event of restructuring  of Departments, lease breaks and where opportunities exist to enhance service  delivery. I commented on the Minister&rsquo;s remarks because he was unfair to those  proposals, as though they would involve dramatic dislocation of existing job  positioning.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The report is specific in its proposal to use  opportunities. It names 13 bodies that are either new or significantly  restructured, where considerable change is necessary and inevitable. The  Minister was not fair to that proposal from the Bain committee at all. The  report also proposes how that will be delivered by the Executive and a  secretariat, none of which, sadly, has been introduced by the Minister.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The issue of cost was dwelt on at some length. Peter Weir  told us that affordability is the fatal flaw. Roy Beggs supported that  position. Perhaps the figure of &pound;40 million is in the report somewhere.  However, I read quite a bit of the financial information yet struggled to find  it. If one reads the contents of the text and the appendices, it is clear that the  matter is much more complex. The cost is variable and depends, according to the  report, on many assumptions. It is uncertain and depends on which particular  project is being taken forward. It certainly cannot be pitched simply by  creating a worst-case-scenario figure of &pound;40 million and then saying that it is  not doable. That is not constructive and is unlike the Minister, who is capable  of original thinking and is willing to get on with tackling problems. I am  disappointed that he continues to take the approach that he is taking.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Stephen Farry told the House that if particular cases were  analysed, opportunities sought, and cost-benefit analyses carried out, they  would all fail the green book. That depends on what values they have, on which  I will comment further, and to what degree and how the benefits that have been  discussed are costed, which may or may not be capable of financial realisation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are, of course, living in difficult financial times.  However, rather than say that we cannot touch the &pound;40 million, and thereby do  nothing, I suggest that it is the Minister&rsquo;s job to sort that out. To dump the  problem on the Executive, as he did, and to tell other Ministers to bring him  their proposals is not what the Assembly expects from the lead Minister. It expects  that Minister to produce the beginnings of proposals.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bain committee&rsquo;s overall proposal is modest.  Nonetheless, he wants it to be delivered strategically. Although I accept that  it is more difficult to do that strategically if it is done piecemeal, it is  much better than doing nothing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to mention the collapse of Workplace 2010. There is  a huge need to upgrade the Civil Service estate. That is an opportunity to be  used. It must be remembered that modern office buildings are much cheaper to run.  That argument has been made for investment in buildings. I praise the Minister  for his openness to the invest to save concept. I would like to think that he  is listening to me. Why does he not apply his invest to save thinking to that  issue? The simple fact that office rentals are much cheaper outside of Belfast must also be  remembered. The report provides evidence of that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Last week, I attended a conference on spatial planning and  economic development. Of course, that particular discussion is part of a wider  debate on spatial planning. Bain considered the regional development strategy  when he was devising his proposals. If our regional development strategy is to  go anywhere, the spatial planning element needs to be thought of in the context  of the whole island.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to make an important point relating to Stephen  Farry&rsquo;s concerns about distributing the cake versus baking more cakes and his  remarkable comment about public sector jobs being a poor substitute for private  sector jobs. I do not think that that is a proper analysis of the value to  society of public sector jobs vis-&agrave;-vis private sector jobs. It is not a  competition in that sense. However, it raises the point that all spatial  planning has a value base.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am told that Scotland has embraced a culture of  spatial planning more strongly than we have done. It has been embraced by the  political elite there to the extent that spatial planning sits within the  Department of Finance and Sustainable Growth. We need to decide where we want  to go. We must not be put off by the first obstacle. The current financial  obstacle before us is major, but we need to decide where we want to go, what  our values are and what our political decision is.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  am not permitted more time, and I have only a few seconds left. Therefore, with  respect, Mr Campbell, I cannot give way.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to repeat an analogy that was used: use a garryowen,  and do not forever stay stuck in the scrum.</p>
