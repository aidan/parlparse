                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment (Sir Reg Empey):</p>
                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From Tuesday 30 January to Friday 2 February
                2001, Northern Ireland had more doors open to it in mainland
                Europe than at any time in the last decades of the twentieth
                century. We were warmly received, we broke new ground and our
                economic message reached a wide and influential audience.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two simple themes dominated our four-day
                tour. The first was that Northern Ireland, through its new
                institutions, is steering a course to a new era of economic
                well-being and prosperity. The second was the straightforward
                and attractive business case for inward investment, strategic
                and trade opportunities, and what our academic institutions can
                contribute in the fields of research and cutting-edge
                technologies. Tourism also featured prominently in our
                presentations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We embarked on the European marketing
                campaign to tell audiences in France and Germany that in this
                Assembly the potential exists to put conflict behind us and that
                together we are building a new and inclusive society for all our
                people. I have great pleasure in reporting to the Assembly that
                we achieved all three objectives. I will attempt to put some
                meat on the bones of each of those points.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the first instance, the campaign was given
                a political focus through the active participation of our First
                and Deputy First Ministers. Without them, the venture would not
                have been as successful. History was made on the first leg of
                the tour in Paris when, for the first time, the leaders of the
                new Administration met with a European head of state, President
                Jacques Chirac.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They briefed President&nbsp;Chirac on
                devolution, told him how we are now managing our affairs and how
                our economy is performing and set out our many advantages as a
                business partner and business location. The First Minister
                described their meeting at the Elysée Palace as &quot;a
                milestone&quot;, an assessment wholeheartedly endorsed by the
                Deputy First Minister. For his part, President&nbsp;Chirac was
                fulsome in his praise for what we are trying to achieve here.
                Mr&nbsp;Trimble and Mr&nbsp;Mallon found a willing ally, but
                without them this high-profile meeting would not have taken
                place.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following the meeting with President Chirac,
                both the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister met the
                European Minister in the French Government, Mr&nbsp;Moscovici,
                to brief him on the position in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before their courtesy call on President
                Chirac, an audience of over 200 business people heard at first
                hand what the Northern Ireland of today has to offer Europe.
                This lunchtime event was organised by the Mouvement des
                Entreprises de France (MEDEF), the French equivalent of the CBI,
                and took place in the ornate surroundings of Le&nbsp;Grand
                Hôtel.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Seven subsidiaries of French companies have a
                presence in Northern Ireland and, between them, employ more than
                3,000 people. France is the leading European investor in the
                Province, and its approval and endorsement are significant. For
                example, the French Ambassador to the United Kingdom,
                M&nbsp;Daniel&nbsp;Bernard, made our task all the easier when he
                told the gathering that &quot;Northern Ireland is a good bet.
                Northern Ireland is good for business&quot;.
                M&nbsp;François&nbsp;Périgot, who is the Chairman of MEDEF,
                talked about the &quot;remarkable economic dynamism in Northern
                Ireland&quot;, adding later in his speech that the region is
                &quot;a safe investment&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Not too long ago, such glowing accolades
                would have been unthinkable. They are happening now in national
                capitals because we are coming out from under the cloud of
                violence and hopelessness — some would say more slowly than we
                should — into an era in which hope and confidence can
                flourish.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That event on its own was a resounding
                success. Executives from French industry and business were
                impressed with the presentations delivered by Mr&nbsp;Trimble
                and Mr&nbsp;Mallon, and many stayed behind to ask follow-up
                questions and establish contact with IDB personnel, who were on
                hand to maximise the opportunities. Later,
                Sir&nbsp;Michael&nbsp;Jay, the British Ambassador, and
                Mr&nbsp;Patrick O’Connor, the Irish Ambassador, hosted a
                dinner in the British residence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From Paris, our European marketing campaign
                headed to Düsseldorf, the capital of North Rhine-Westphalia.
                Ongoing political discussions at home meant that this leg of the
                tour had to be conducted without the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister. At this point, my ministerial Colleague,
                Dr&nbsp;Sean&nbsp;Farren, joined the party. Together we paid
                courtesy calls on civic leaders and had a very worthwhile and
                productive meeting with the region’s Economy Minister,
                Herr&nbsp;Ernst&nbsp;Schwannhold. Our discussion was
                wide-ranging, taking in the desirability of establishing closer
                links between our academic institutions and the scope that
                exists for strategic alliances in the areas of biotechnology,
                avionics, informatics and textiles.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was clear from this wide-ranging
                discussion that considerable scope exists for meaningful and
                very practical co-operation. Our hosts heard of the
                ground-breaking research being conducted here, and it seemed to
                us to be logical to explore the feasibility of involving
                institutions from Düsseldorf in the work. Both Dr&nbsp;Farren’s
                office and the IDB are undertaking follow-up work in that
                regard.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our visit to Düsseldorf culminated in a very
                successful dinner, attended by business people and key
                influencers, at which a multi-media presentation was made on the
                Northern Ireland business opportunity. Furthermore, we were
                delighted to announce that the German company, M&amp;M Software
                GmbH, is setting up a new software development operation in
                Northern Ireland. This announcement sent a strong message to
                other German companies that Northern Ireland is a cost-effective
                location with high-quality software engineers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The dinner was followed by a musical finale,
                led by Belfast soprano Angela&nbsp;Feeney and her Laganside
                group of young musicians. I have to say that if Members had been
                present, they would have been very proud of Angela’s
                performance and that of the young musicians from Northern
                Ireland who were with her. They were absolutely superb and had
                the audience captivated. IDB’s Düsseldorf office is actively
                following up the business contacts generated by the event.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We arrived in Berlin the following day. As in
                Paris, there was considerable media and press interest. The
                First Minister and Dr Farren paid a courtesy call on the Federal
                Foreign Minister, Joschka Fischer, and briefed him on political
                and economic developments before returning to the British
                Embassy for a lunch that was jointly hosted by the British and
                Irish Ambassadors, Sir Paul Lever and Noel Fahey. The guest of
                honour was Dr Manfred Stolpe, Ministerpräsident of Brandenburg.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All of this would not have been possible
                without the organisational skills and contacts that have been
                carefully nurtured by IDB. The work done by IDB personnel and
                others paved the way for this historic visit, and I place on
                record my thanks and the thanks of my ministerial Colleagues,
                for the superb way IDB managed the tour.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thanks are also due to the ambassadors and
                staff at the British embassies in Paris and Berlin,
                Sir&nbsp;Michael&nbsp;Jay and Sir&nbsp;Paul&nbsp;Lever, and to
                their Irish counterparts Mr&nbsp;Patrick&nbsp;O’Connor and
                Mr&nbsp;Noel&nbsp;Fahey. Thanks are due also to Her Majesty’s
                Consul General in Düsseldorf, Northern Ireland-born diplomat
                Boyd&nbsp;McCleary. Their enthusiasm to assist was matched by
                our own eagerness to deliver our confident and up-beat economic
                messages to very receptive French and German audiences.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The four-day tour was not about going to
                Europe to ask for help. It was not about meeting senior
                politicians, important although that is. It was about telling
                our story, our way, with honesty, conviction and some pride. It
                is a good story; one that gets better as each week goes by. We
                have the youngest and most highly talented workforce in the
                United Kingdom. Our manufacturing output is up 35% in the last
                decade. Overseas investment last year has more than doubled on
                that in the previous year. Eight out of every 10 new jobs
                promoted by IDB are with high-tech, knowledge-based companies.
                Tourism, which has long been in the doldrums, has bounced back
                with record levels of visitors. Our education system and
                comprehensive training programmes are the envy of many other
                regions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In France, our sixth-largest export market,
                and in Germany, in fourth place, our mission was to explain that
                Northern Ireland is good for business, and has attractions few
                other regions can boast.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We want trade to grow, we want businesses to
                flourish, and collectively we will do all that we can to
                position Northern Ireland at the top of every political and
                business leader’s agenda. The initiatives are invaluable and
                do bear fruit. There is no instant panacea, no magic formula,
                just careful contact-building and meticulous follow-up. That is
                the job we are now undertaking, but it is made easier by having
                the support and endorsement of the House and the Executive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is now greater awareness in France and
                Germany of what we are creating here. In those countries there
                is a willingness to support our efforts to build a vibrant and
                successful economy. In France and Germany, there are European
                partners who want to see us achieve the goal of long-term peace
                and stability.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The IDB will continue to pursue the many
                business leads resulting from this visit. I have no doubt that
                increased business will follow, and for those industrialists
                seeking to expand, they will find the right partner and the
                right business environment in Northern Ireland. When we open our
                representative office in Brussels later this year I hope we will
                have a firm platform upon which to build our message to mainland
                Europe.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend the statement to the House.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Enterprise,
                Trade and Investment Committee (Mr Neeson):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for his comprehensive
                report and congratulate him and his Colleagues for taking this
                initiative. Are there any special areas of interest shown by
                people in France and Germany? What plans do he and his
                Department have as a follow-up? Looking further ahead, and
                bearing in mind the forthcoming enlargement of the European
                Union, what plans do he and his Department have to help Northern
                Ireland take advantage of the situation?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There were special areas of interest. When in
                North Rhine-Westphalia I was accompanied by Dr Farren at a
                meeting with the Economics Minister. To put the North
                Rhine-Westphalia area into context, the gross domestic product
                of that state is equivalent to 25% of the gross domestic product
                of Germany.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.45 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are therefore talking about a very
                significant area. There was clear evidence there of a
                willingness to co-operate on pursuing biotechnology issues, and
                Dr Farren is actively involved in trying to link our
                universities with the relevant counterparts in Düsseldorf. We
                have both issued a personal invitation to the Minister of
                Economics and Technology to visit Northern Ireland. We
                understand that he is coming to London later in the year, and we
                are trying to arrange a visit for him to Northern Ireland. We
                also met the mayor of Düsseldorf earlier in the day, and he is
                coming to Northern Ireland in June. Düsseldorf is a very
                vibrant city. The recent takeover by Vodafone Group plc of
                Mannesmann AG, which is one of the main employers in Düsseldorf,
                has put British industry very much in the centre of the scene
                there.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members may be aware that we have a
                Düsseldorf office. That office did an enormous amount of work
                and is actively following up a number of very significant
                software companies, including some young software companies, in
                that area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also discussed air links, because one of
                the big problems that we have as a region is the absence of
                direct links to mainland Europe. We have only one or two at
                present, and I believe that there is significant potential, if
                we can follow that up.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member made a point about enlargement. As
                he probably knows, my Department has the NI-CO organisation,
                which specialises in offering services to other countries —
                particularly those in eastern Europe. That organisation is
                actively pursuing contracts and working with the Department for
                International Development in London so that we can inject
                expertise from Northern Ireland companies, and indeed public
                service contracts, into companies which are currently supported
                by the European Union through schemes — such as Technical
                Assistance to the Commonwealth of Independent States (TACIS) —
                or potential enlargement countries. Activity is ongoing, and the
                test, of course, will be whether in the long run we are able to
                land some of these companies. The prospects seem to be
                encouraging.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for his very
                comprehensive report. I am sure that he would wish to commend
                those companies that already export to the French and German
                markets. My question focuses on the commercial links between
                Northern Ireland and those two countries. Exports from Northern
                Ireland to the Republic of Ireland grew by 81% between 1991 and
                1999, by 34% to the rest of the European Union, and by 176% to
                the rest of the world, outside the EU. Does the Minister agree
                that such figures indicate that our companies have shown
                commendable flexibility in facing various values of the pound
                sterling, and that there is a need for IDB and trade agency
                policy to focus on EU markets over and above the Republic of
                Ireland market?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The export performance of Northern Ireland in
                recent years has been commendable. We have had a mountain to
                climb. With the euro sometimes over 30% ahead of us, our
                exporters have had a huge problem with the sterling value.
                Although there has been significant improvement in our exports
                to the Republic, there is still a significant deficit in our
                trade with the Republic. I am hoping that through
                InterTradeIreland, and other efforts and initiatives, we will
                gradually overcome that. It is certainly our intention to grow
                that trade.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, a lot of concentration in recent
                times has been on the north American market, because that is
                where the growth has been coming from. That is where the
                investment has, by and large, been coming from — generated and
                assisted by currency stability between sterling and the dollar.
                That has been a pattern in recent years, and clearly it has
                allowed this area to develop. Having said that, it is clear that
                in the past couple of months there has been a gradual erosion in
                the differential between sterling and the euro. I hope that that
                trend continues. I believe that it is now an opportune time to
                involve ourselves with our European partners to a greater extent
                than has been the case.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The reason for that is very simple — our
                economies, I believe, are gradually converging. The expansion of
                the European Union is in the pipeline, and it is going to become
                a market of well over 400 million people. It would be foolish
                for such a small region as ours to ignore that market. The
                European Union has given us very considerable support,
                financially and in other ways, over recent years. Very few
                regions in Europe would receive the great welcome that we have
                had. Our Ministers can go and see a head of state and other
                senior Government Ministers in two of the principal European
                capitals. The opportunity is clear, and the door is open.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our European partners have a significant
                understanding of our situation here — they were very well
                informed, and the press was very interested. When our
                representation is opened in Brussels, I hope that there will be
                an economic dimension to it. I intend to see that our European
                partners are vigorously targeted from a trade and investment
                point of view.</p>

                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Courtney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is good to see that Ministers are going
                out and seeking inward investment — that is what we really
                need. What is the state of current German investment here? The
                Minister announced that M &amp; M Software was going to set up
                another software company here. How successful is the current
                drive for German investment? I know that he is expecting the
                arrival in June of the Mayor of Düsseldorf. However, what
                additional investment is he expecting as a result of his visit
                to Düsseldorf?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A number of German companies are based in
                Northern Ireland. The Member will know that Arntz has been
                operating in her constituency for many years and is well
                established. Another company of which the Member may be aware is
                Hüco Lightronic in Limavady. I presented an award there when
                the expansion of the company was announced a few weeks ago, and
                the company was represented at our function in Düsseldorf. It
                has achieved very significant training awards throughout the UK,
                and it is doing very well.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the scale of the German economy and
                the level of investment here are not matched. In other words, we
                are very significantly under-represented in terms of German
                investment. It is our fourth-largest export market, but it is
                well down the list of investors here, and that is why we have a
                small office in Düsseldorf. Most of the potential contacts that
                are there at the moment tend to be involved in the software and
                telecoms sector. Officials tell me that they are optimistic, and
                we believe that a number of significant companies are on the
                verge of committing themselves to Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But, to be frank, one of the evident
                difficulties is that, although there is a willingness to
                consider Northern Ireland as a location, particularly because of
                our supply of software expertise, potential investors are still
                nervous about our situation. One of the purposes of being out in
                the marketplace is to make personal contacts and to make people
                feel more comfortable. But it is a fact of life that our job,
                both in tourism and in attracting inward investment, will remain
                at a disadvantage until things settle down here and people feel
                confident that the past is genuinely behind us. That is our
                single biggest obstacle. But, nevertheless and notwithstanding,
                we have been getting a small amount of investment from that area
                — it is far less than it should be, and that is why we are
                concentrating there.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am delighted that the Minister did not
                advertise Northern Ireland as a low-wage economy — we have
                been using that selling point for far too long, and we need to
                put it behind us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Minister is aware that many areas in
                Northern Ireland suffer from a skills shortage. Is it not a
                danger that he may stimulate a demand in some of the companies
                he has targeted which cannot be met, given that we do not have
                the trained young people available to take up the jobs on offer?
                Is he content and certain that if results accrue from his trade
                mission, we will be able to deliver the workforce that is
                required?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is a very sensible question. We have a
                comparatively low-cost economy, and that is a perfectly
                legitimate point to market. I agree that we should not be
                marketing a low-wage economy; in fact that is entirely the wrong
                way to go. However, I have been in contact with my Colleague
                Dr&nbsp;Farren very closely on this, and our Departments are
                very acutely aware of the skills position. Yes, it is true that
                bottlenecks are beginning to emerge in the labour market.
                However, because of the demographic profile of our population,
                we have a significant flow into the labour market every year,
                and we have to ensure sufficient job opportunities for those
                people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a balancing act, particularly when
                unemployment is at historically low levels — we are not used
                to that. Nevertheless, to take our foot off the accelerator at
                this stage would be a mistake, because as the Member will know
                there are ebbs and flows and cycles in an economy, and we will
                have bad days as well as good. Dr&nbsp;Farren and his Department
                are working very closely with mine on this. We are doing our
                level best to ensure that the demands of industry are met
                through the training and education and also through our Track
                Back Programme, Back to the Future, which is endeavouring to
                bring experienced people back to Northern Ireland. We believe
                that this combination will ensure that potential investors find
                the labour they require.</p>

                are building a new inclusive society for all our people&quot;.
                How does he feel this objective will be achieved when the
                First&nbsp;Minister continues to enforce an unlawful ban on the
                legitimate attendance of Sinn Feín Ministers at North/South
                Ministerial meetings and has threatened to extend his unlawful
                activities?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When his Department embarks on trade missions
                and the First&nbsp;Minister and the Deputy First Minister have
                to be replaced, why is it the norm that preference for
                replacement is given to Members from their own parties? How can
                this contribute to the principle of inclusiveness?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I suspect that one or two of those points are
                slightly at variance with the subject matter in front of us
                today. Our objective in the Programme for Government is to
                ensure that we provide the best possible economic circumstances
                in which people can have an expectation of and an opportunity to
                obtain fulfilling careers and work. As an economic objective,
                that is entirely consistent with inclusiveness. I do not want to
                get involved in an argument with the hon Lady over these other
                matters; however, I will reiterate that the best way to ensure
                inclusion in any society is to provide general access to good
                jobs. What can be more inclusive than conditions in which
                everyone can have a stake and a wage, something to protect and
                the ability to deliver a standard of living to his family? I am
                sure the Member will agree with that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me turn to the substance of what the hon
                Lady was saying. We can have our political arguments, but if we
                go back to the source of these we face difficulties and meet
                concerns about whether we have settled our affairs.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is perfectly clear that these things are
                not entirely settled, and that is the underlying reason. Dr
                Farren’s appearance was entirely appropriate because his
                Department and my Department work closely together on training
                and employment matters, which are, of course, an integral part
                of our economic drive. If the hon Member refers to ‘Strategy
                2010’, produced some two years ago, she will see that there is
                an inextricable link between training and employment and
                economic development. Our two Departments work closely together
                to ensure that our activities are co-ordinated and entirely
                consistent with economic development.</p>

                have congratulated the Minister on what seems to have been a
                remarkable visit. It is very valuable to start focusing on
                continental Europe.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can the Minister go into more detail on the
                concrete business links that could be made and the subsequent
                follow-up, and can he put this in the context of the major
                problem we face with inward investment, namely our decision to
                stay outside the euro zone? Was the issue raised in meetings
                with the French and Germans? The Minister has said that our past
                is the single biggest obstacle to investment. Does he not agree
                that our future outside the euro zone is also a major obstacle
                and is he not be tempted to encourage our entry to the euro
                zone?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The logic of the euro zone is to follow
                consistent economic policies across those member countries that
                are included. Yesterday’s meeting of Finance Ministers in
                Brussels saw Mr McCreevy of the Irish Republic put into
                quarantine because he was pursuing his own economic policies.
                So, the club is OK as long you are allowed to do whatever you
                like.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand the difficulties the euro has
                caused in terms of some of Northern Ireland’s exports, but it
                must be remembered that countries that can buy in the euro and
                sell in the dollar — and quite a number of Northern Ireland
                companies do that — have done quite well over the past few
                years. In fact, we have significantly developed our trade with
                North America and the rest of the world.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem is that the euro is undervalued,
                not that sterling is overvalued, and I hope the current
                convergence will continue. However, as we have seen with Mr
                McCreevy, the fact is that if you hand over control of interest
                rates to somebody else — which is what joining the euro means
                — there are consequences such as Germany’s wanting lower
                interest rates and Ireland’s needing higher ones. That is the
                current reality. This absence is slowing down growth in Germany
                and creating inflation in the Republic.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Economies were not properly converged when
                member states joined. The principle of whether a nation can keep
                control over its economy must be considered. I think it would be
                madness for the United Kingdom to join the euro, particularly at
                the present levels of exchange, and I do not believe that there
                is consensus in the United Kingdom.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been vigorous follow-up because the
                IDB was involved in selecting and inviting companies, especially
                so in Germany, and the MEDEF was involved in the selection of
                people who attended the Paris function.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To have the French Ambassador stand up to
                market Northern Ireland to his fellow countrymen was remarkable.
                It was also remarkable, in one day, to see the representatives
                of a small nation meet the President of the French Republic, the
                French Minister of European Affairs and top industrialists and
                to be addressed by the French Ambassador and the head of the

                relate to the Minister’s statement to his ministerial remit.
                Decisions on the euro go slightly higher up the tree than those

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate and thank the Minister for his
                extremely positive statement. Will he confirm that an
                unprecedented number of contacts were made during the visit and
                that Northern Ireland plc received an unprecedented level of
                marketing? Does he also agree that much of the visit’s success
                was due to the fact that our institutions are up and running and
                that those from here who attended presented a united front?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">High quality contacts were made and, if I
                could relate to our German experience, it was a significant
                advantage that the Consul General in Düsseldorf, who is a very
                experienced diplomat, comes from Belfast. The Düsseldorf Consul
                General’s office is responsible for all United Kingdom
                economic activity in Germany. Therefore, although it is a
                consulate, it is in charge of all the UK’s inward investment
                activity. It is a powerful office, employing over 70&nbsp;staff
                dedicated to economic development and co-operation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no doubt that to mount that type of
                operation without the institutions in place would have been
                difficult. Yes, it has been done in the past, but a federal
                state like Germany, with its own Ministers and Government in
                each state, can now relate to us as a region. A similar
                situation exists in France. The message that our colleagues in
                Europe got from us, as well as information on what has been
                happening, was infinitely more positive than it would have been
                a few years ago when we were effectively seen as a war zone.
                Europe correctly takes some degree of pride in the fact that it
                has made financial and unique contributions to here. The Member
                for North Down, Ms&nbsp;Morrice, will understand from her
                previous position that I mean &quot;unique&quot; in terms of
                peace and reconciliation. Those are things that have never
                happened before — no previous examples exist. Our European
                colleagues are paying close attention and are impressed by the
                progress that has been made. They understand that we have not
                yet reached a conclusion, but, nevertheless, valuable contacts
                have been made. But for our current situation, that would not
                have been possible.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr McDonnell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to congratulate the Minister, the
                First Minister, the Deputy First Minister and the Minister of
                Higher and Further Education, Training and Employment for what
                has clearly been a success story. Having worked with the
                Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment and observed his
                activities on the other side of the Atlantic, I expect very high
                standards from him. However, the greatest potential for
                immediate benefit from Germany and France lies in tourism. Can
                the Minister give us any good news on that front? Does the
                Tourist Board plan to market tourism more in France and Germany?
                I see the marketing of tourism as a continuation of the efforts
                that the Minister made during his visit. By selling Northern
                Ireland, the Tourist Board should add value to that visit.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is a very interesting question. The
                Northern Ireland Tourist Board has appointed an agent in Paris.
                Last year in tourism there was an increase of 44% in the number
                of visitors from France. The figures went up to over 18,000.
                That is not a huge number, but it has an advantage in that it
                represents high, added-value visitors.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The people being targeted for tourism are not
                those who go for two weeks in the sun in Ibiza — it is not
                that type of a market. There is great interest in our culture,
                heritage, gardens, hunting, shooting and fishing — this type
                of holiday is popular in France. Certain small companies
                specialise in such holidays, and our agent has good links with
                them. I did an interview with a leading French tourist journal.
                A marketing member from the Tourist Board accompanied me and
                went on to make further contacts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a similar situation in Germany.
                Germans hire a significant number of the cruisers on Lough Erne,
                and they have stayed loyal throughout the difficult years. It is
                this type of specialist, natural-resource based tourism, with a
                high value added, that is the type of targeted market we must
                address. We have had a good success with France in the last
                year. We need to work hard on the German market, and our
                representation in Brussels, when we get it up and running, will
                provide us with a base.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is about targeting these specialist, high
                value areas, which are not so subject to price fluctuation. We
                do have to bear in mind that we have been walking uphill against
                the currency differential. However, the tourist potential in
                France is high and the performance last year was excellent, with
                a 44% increase.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s statement, in
                which he says tourism is bouncing back with record levels of
                visitors. If this continues, do we have enough bed places to
                facilitate the visitors? If not, has he any plans to grant-aid
                farmers who want to diversify into providing bed-and-breakfast
                accommodation?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is a very useful contribution. If we get
                the level of tourists we should be getting, the answer is we
                would not have the capacity to cope with them. I have said
                before in the House that our tourism is operating at roughly one
                third of what it should be. If we compare ourselves with our
                nearest neighbours in Scotland and the Republic, tourism
                accounts for about 6% of their gross domestic product — here
                it is less than 2%.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to look closely at diversification by
                farmers. We have a scheme where if two or more units are being
                converted then the tourist board can contribute and help. Some
                people may be starting from scratch, and there are business
                start-up opportunities from LEDU that could be pursued. If the
                Member has any examples in his own constituency I would be very
                happy to look at them for him. We do need to refine that
                particular market more.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I have to say this — and it is not
                a new thing but it is something that we all need to be aware of.
                Because of our particular circumstances every summer we are
                creating a &quot;black hole&quot; for tourism in July and
                August. The best part of our season is turning into a disaster
                and this has been going on for years. Despite that we have been
                able to increase our numbers, which is miraculous. Until we get
                the matter resolved, we will not get tourism to a point where it
                should be.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a chicken-and-egg situation — people
                will not invest unless the tourists are here and tourists will
                not come here unless the situation settles. The major bus
                companies and tour operators are saying &quot;We will come on
                the shoulder of the season, in April and October, but we are not
                bringing our people into a firefight in July&quot;. Everybody in
                the House has to realise the implications of what we are doing.
                We understand the reasons, and I will not get involved in the
                arguments now, but the matter has to be resolved before we can
                really get tourism off the ground.</p>

                Northern Ireland should be based on political reality and not on
                political spin. How can he say to the French and the Germans
                that the potential exists to put conflict behind us, when,
                within the terms of the Belfast Agreement, there is no
                requirement for the terrorists to give up their weapons and
                when, in the process of this current negotiation, the terrorists
                on both sides have not only refused to give up their weapons but

                The Minister may respond, if he wishes, to the first few words
                of the question, which were relevant. It becomes rather
                pointless if every statement that every Minister makes on any

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. If Members wish to have conversations,
                which is perfectly reasonable, I ask that they do so in the
                Lobby.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms de Brún:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When this matter first came to light last
                month, I asked for an investigation to be undertaken immediately
                to establish the scale of the problem here and the number of
                organs being retained. As part of this investigation, the chief
                medical officer wrote to all health and social services trusts
                seeking information on their practices relating to post mortems
                and organ retention.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can now report that nearly 50,000 post
                mortems have been undertaken in hospitals since 1970, and the
                vast majority of these were carried out by state pathologists
                under the Coroners Act 1988. It is reported that 376 children’s
                organs have been retained prior to the introduction of the
                current guidelines. They are held without informed parental
                consent. There are three hundred and sixty one in the Royal
                Victoria Hospital and 15 in Altnagelvin Hospital. One additional
                child’s organ has been retained with full parental consent at
                Craigavon Area Hospital.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The investigation also covered the retention
                of adult organs following post mortem examinations. Apart from
                the Royal Victoria Hospital, 60 adult organs have been retained,
                mostly without informed consent: 45 in Altnagelvin Hospital;
                three in the Ulster Hospital; and 12 in Craigavon Area Hospital
                — nine of which are with relatives’ full consent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the Royal Group of Hospitals, 677 brains
                and spinal cords have been retained. A detailed inventory of all
                adult tissue samples in the hospital is underway to check if
                they include other organs. This physical inspection is
                proceeding with all haste, and a definitive answer on the number
                and type of organs retained is expected by the end of February.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand that all the retained organs
                identified have been held following a hospital post mortem or a
                coroner’s post mortem. It is also apparent that in many cases,
                organs have been held for a time as part of a post mortem
                investigation and subsequently cremated. Until recently, this
                was a common practice throughout these isles, but it is clearly
                not acceptable for that to happen without informed consent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The investigation has confirmed that the
                number of organs retained here has not been on the same scale as
                in England. It has found no evidence of any systematic wholesale
                retention of organs, as was the case in Alder Hey Hospital.
                However, I am clear that no organs should be retained by the
                Health Service without the explicit and informed consent of the
                family of the deceased. This is absolutely essential.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have listened carefully to the voice of
                parents and to the many helpful points raised by Members in the
                course of the recent debate on this subject. My conclusion is
                that there are still too many questions unanswered. Decisive
                action is needed to answer the questions put by many of the
                families affected, and to restore faith in our service and in
                future post mortem practice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To achieve this, I am announcing a major
                initiative to investigate past actions, support those affected,
                and ensure that such practices can never recur. The initiative
                will include the following measures. First, there will be an
                inquiry established under article 54 of the Health and Personal
                Social Services (Northern Ireland) Order 1972 to review past and
                current practice in post mortem and organ removal, retention and
                disposal. The inquiry will report on past practice and make
                recommendations for future arrangements, and it will report to
                me within twelve months.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, a relatives’ support group will
                be set up quickly to work with parents and hospitals in order to
                ensure that the families affected receive full and timely
                information and support. The group will bring together parents,
                health and social services councils, bereavement counsellors and
                other interests, to ensure that parents and relatives are given
                appropriate advice, information and effective support.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, there will be a review of the Human
                Tissue Act (Northern Ireland) 1962, with the aim of
                strengthening its provisions in regard to consent and making it
                a criminal offence to retain organs without informed consent.
                The review will take appropriate account of parallel
                developments in Great Britain. I also wish to ensure that
                proposed amendments are broadly compatible with the views of the
                inquiry on what is required.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fourthly, recognising that the new
                legislation will take time to be put on the statute book, I will
                prepare good practice guidelines for the health services. These
                will provide interim guidance to the service on acceptable
                practice, pending new legislation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The inquiry will have the power to summon
                witnesses and require the presentation of information, should
                that prove necessary. I will be furnishing the inquiry with the
                information gathered in the course of my own investigation,
                which it will supersede. I hope to announce shortly further
                details of the inquiry and membership of the support group.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Health, Social
                Services and Public Safety Committee (Dr Hendron):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s statement on
                behalf of the Health, Social Services and Public Safety
                Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would have preferred a full public inquiry
                into the matter. However, I am aware of the very great
                sensitivities of the families who have been bereaved over the
                years and where organs of their loved ones have been retained.
                The Minister mentioned that the Human Tissue Act (Northern
                Ireland) 1962 legislation would be looked at. I wonder if the
                Coroners Act 1959 should be looked at as well, because I
                understand that people in England are looking closely at the
                Coroners Act there.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Looking at the statement, I was aware that
                376 children’s organs had been retained but was not aware that
                677 adult’s brains and spinal cords had been retained at the
                Royal Group of Hospitals. Obviously, a lot of people will be
                asking questions about that and about the other organs that were
                subsequently cremated. However, that will be the purpose of the
                inquiry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While I would prefer a full public inquiry
                into this matter, the Minister seems to be proceeding along
                these lines. My question concerns her last comment that she
                hopes to announce shortly further details of the inquiry and
                membership of the support group. Will she present the terms of
                reference concerning that inquiry and the support group
                membership to the Assembly?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms de Brún:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, it will become very clear that this
                will be a full statutory inquiry, not only because of the
                statute under which it is being set up but also from its terms
                of reference. As such, it will have the power to engage with the
                public, to call for evidence from whomsoever it feels can best
                contribute to the inquiry and hold its meetings in public if it
                feels that that is necessary or desirable.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.30 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The inquiry’s terms of reference will
                require it to take account of the views and reasonable
                expectations of parents and relatives. It will report to me, and
                its findings will be made public.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Health, Social
                Services and Public Safety Committee (Mr Gallagher): </p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></b>I also welcome the Minister’s
                announcement about the inquiry and the setting up of a support
                group. People who have been affected by the organ retention
                scandal are asking what happened and why they were not told
                about it sooner. It is hoped that the inquiry and the support
                group will address and answer those questions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like other Members, I have been approached by
                members of the public who have been affected by organ retention.
                The Minister’s statement contains an assumption that, in many
                cases, organs were held and subsequently cremated. Will the
                inquiry be able to give Members information on cremation
                records? Was cremation the only means of disposal used? If not,
                what other means were used?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister also tell the House if the
                support group will have links with every trust group? The
                families affected by the organ scandal live in every part of
                Northern Ireland.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms de Brún:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cremation and organ disposal will be part and
                parcel of the inquiry. The inquiry will be able to find out the
                relevant information on those issues and present its findings to
                the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Hendron previously asked a question about
                the review of the Coroners Act. As Dr Hendron said, that review
                is taking place in England, and the spin-off from that might
                well input in to legislation here, but that will not be within
                my power. However, I will be bringing forward legislation that
                will cover all aspects of ensuring that practice here is carried
                out to the highest possible standard in the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gallagher also asked if the support group
                will have links with trusts in every area. It is essential that
                the support group liaises with families and their
                representatives throughout the inquiry and that their needs and
                concerns are established. It is also essential that the support
                group works directly with the hospitals to ensure that the
                arrangements address the needs of families effectively and
                sensitively. The Department of Health, Social Services and
                Public Safety has already issued guidance to trusts about the
                required support for families, particularly those who live a
                long distance from the hospital at which their relatives’
                organs are being retained.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department needs to ensure that any
                subsequent support builds on that and that the highest standards
                and fullest efforts are made to meet the concerns and needs of
                parents. It is also important that the Department of Health,
                Social Services and Public Safety receive the best possible
                advice with regard to setting standards for the future and
                bringing forward new legislation.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also welcome the Minister’s statement and
                commend the speed with which her inquiry has been commenced.
                According to a rough calculation from the information in the
                report, there are 1,113 organs retained in hospitals. How many
                organs have been returned to relatives? Will the new guidelines
                be announced to the Assembly? Can the Minister give any
                indication when legislation will be laid before the House?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms de Brún:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, the process of discussions with
                parents as to what they wish to be done with the organs, how
                they wish this to be treated and where they are to be returned
                is ongoing. I cannot give you an exact figure for the number of
                organs returned to relatives. However, it is small compared to
                the number of organs that have been retained. The support
                committee is so important, because the relative social services,
                councils and others can give advice and work alongside those who
                can find their way through the system and ensure that parents
                have access to the absolute, total information and support that
                they require.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will make the guidelines and the terms of
                reference known to the Assembly. I will also make the membership
                of the group and of the inquiry team known to the Assembly. We
                want the fullest possible information to be available to ensure
                that the way forward is built upon the experiences to date and
                the knowledge of what is needed for the future.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs I Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister accept that her initial
                inquiry was insufficient and that she ought to have had a full
                and proper inquiry from the start? Does she accept that the
                drip-feed process which we have all witnessed has further eroded
                public confidence and that it will be fully and properly
                restored only by a public inquiry? Finally, does the Minister
                accept that this whole matter has seriously damaged public
                confidence in the entire donor system and that that will be
                restored only after a full public inquiry with lay people’s
                involvement?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms de Brún:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As soon as this issue arose I set out very
                clearly the steps that I would take. Those steps involved an
                immediate telephone enquiry to hospitals, followed by an
                investigation carried out by officials, who then sent for
                written information. At the time I made it clear that that
                information was necessary for me to establish the facts of what
                it was we were dealing with and what steps were necessary. I
                made it clear from the outset that nothing would be ruled out.
                People will see that the clear, precise and professional way of
                dealing with this led from the outset to where we are today —
                having a full picture of what we need.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today I announced a package of measures to
                deal not only with the long-term changes — it will take time
                to put legislation in place — but also with an inquiry to
                establish the facts, which could take up to 12&nbsp;months. In
                the interim, guidance has been issued so that practices here are
                informed of the best way forward, and a support group has been
                set up to ensure that relatives do not have to wait until the
                outcome of an inquiry, or for legislation, to see change. They
                can have their concerns addressed and have the availability of
                information and services immediately.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that Members will not say that I have
                handled this in anything other than a very careful, precise and
                professional manner, dealing with the importance of the issue,
                recognising the trauma that parents have been through and
                recognising the need to ensure the highest possible standards.</p>

                brought it any more speedily to the Assembly. It would be
                compounding an injustice and compounding pain if one were to
                make this into some sort of political football.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the time, I congratulated Jim&nbsp;Shannon
                on bringing this motion to the Chamber. I also said that it
                would be tragic if this dreadful situation were allowed to
                influence the very worthy organ donation scheme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This has already happened in England. I hope
                the Minster’s statement will at least assuage and assure
                people who are waiting for organ donations that this fear can be
                put to one side. I believe that the terms of the inquiry will
                satisfy the publicly-stated requirements of the parents, and, to
                that extent, I hope that it will lessen the pain and not
                increase it. That ought to be its overriding thrust.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What exactly is being done to ensure that
                advice, information and appropriate support is available for
                parents? How long will legislation take, and, importantly, what
                will happen in the interim? Can the Minister give an assurance
                that parents will have a key role in dealing with this issue
                during the course of the inquiry, a Cheann Comhairle?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I reiterate that the inquiry will be set up
                under statute with the necessary powers to establish the full
                facts. It will be full and exhaustive. Its terms of reference
                will require that the views and reasonable expectations of
                parents and relatives be taken into account. It will have the
                powers of any statutory inquiry — to engage with the public,
                to hold meetings in public, if it feels that that is necessary
                or desirable, and call whomsoever it feels can best contribute
                to give evidence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have answered some of Mr Kelly’s
                questions in my answers to previous questions. For example,
                trusts have been asked to ensure that in cases where hospitals
                are retaining organs, or if they have information, that
                information is supplied to the relatives and that they look at
                their practices to ensure that this is being done in a manner
                which the relatives require. Trusts in every trust area have
                been told that they need to ensure that support, advice, help
                and counselling, if necessary, are available to parents. They
                specifically need to look at this where relatives are living at
                a distance from the hospital where organs are being retained.
                The establishment of a support group, which I announced today,
                will make very specific provision for liaising with parents,
                families and hospitals to ensure that the support available is
                there for the parents, that practice is as parents would wish
                and that advice is given to my Department in the drawing up of
                interim guidance and legislation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am committed to taking this matter forward
                as quickly as is practicable, given the legislative timetable of
                the Assembly. However, recognising that the legislation will
                take some time to bring on to the statute book, I hope, if we
                can find a window, that it will not take too long. In the
                interim I am taking steps to provide guidance to trusts to
                ensure that they adopt the spirit of proposed legislation prior
                to its coming into force.</p>

                suffered and are suffering. We welcome all the measures outlined
                by the Minister this morning. Can the Minister assure the House
                that her Department will encourage the continuation of the

                will her Department do what is necessary to restore confidence
                in this very important field? Will she assure the House that
                under no circumstances will she ever permit the sale, or
                disposal by any other means, of organs to cosmetic companies or

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have said before that organ retention and
                disposal — and that covers disposal of any sort — will be
                part and parcel of the inquiry. This will be made clear in the
                way we move forward in the future. I certainly hope that the
                measures I announced today will restore public confidence in
                this area by setting standards; by making sure that the public
                is fully informed about what is happening; and finally, but most
                importantly, by ensuring that future practice is based firmly on
                the principal of explicit informed consent of the families.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department will be encouraging the
                voluntary donation of organs as part of its ongoing work. It is
                vital that people are still willing to donate their organs to
                save the lives of others. I understand that that is the case and
                that people are making a distinction. In fact, it has been said
                repeatedly by some of the families involved that if they had
                known that the organs of their loved ones could have helped
                others, they might well have been willing to donate them if they
                had been asked. The problem was that they were not.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have not had the opportunity to check
                article 54 of the Health and Personal Social Services (Northern
                Ireland) Order 1972, but can the Minister confirm the
                composition of the inquiry team? Will she consider parents or
                relatives’ representatives, if not in an advisory capacity
                then as members of the inquiry team? Would that be possible
                under the statute?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If not, would it be possible to have a
                relatives’ advisory group? That would be separate from a
                relatives’ support group, because counselling and support are
                very different from advice that relatives who have been through
                this process could offer. It would also be different from acting
                as a witness to the inquiry. Parents have told me that they have
                asked for direct input into any ongoing inquiry that may be
                established. They feel that they should have a role.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When can we expect to have the interim
                guidance? I support Mr McCarthy’s point, not just as regards
                advice to parents, but for the sake of those engaged in
                transplants. This is an enormous concern at the moment, and
                representations have been made to me. Is there any protocol as
                regards the questions that are asked when requesting voluntary
                donations?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also concerned that the inquiry will not
                report for 12 months. Has the Minister given any consideration
                to the inquiry’s reporting sooner than that? Why was one year
                specified? It seems rather a lengthy inquiry, given that
                legislation will follow thereafter.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In looking at how the inquiry would be set up
                as regards its terms of reference and the length of time it
                would take, I investigated what has happened in England,
                Scotland and the South of Ireland. I had thought of setting up
                an inquiry that would report to me in six months, but I
                understand that where that had happened elsewhere, that time
                frame was not sufficient. I was worried about setting up an
                inquiry and raising expectations and then being seen to dash
                those expectations by lengthening it. That is why I decided on
                12 months.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The inquiry will be set up under statute. It
                will be an independent inquiry, but its terms of reference will
                require it to take account of the views and of the reasonable
                expectations of parents and relatives. Therefore it will be up
                to the team to ensure that that is done. We will make sure that
                there are proper ways in which the inquiry will carry out that
                part of its terms of reference.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I referred to a parents’ support group.
                Perhaps when we come to consider the terms of reference of that
                group, I should call the group something that will clearly show
                that it has more than a supportive role. It will liaise with
                families and hospitals to ensure that arrangements address the
                needs of families effectively and sensitively, but it will also
                be directly involved in influencing the ways in which parents
                and families are advised and supported at this difficult time.
                It will also act as a resource in advising myself, and it will
                assist the Department in developing the necessary guidance and
                the new legislation. It will have a direct role and an integral
                role.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Counselling is a very important issue.
                Measure 2 refers to &quot;bereavement counsellors&quot;. Perhaps
                the Department should be more proactive in relation to
                counselling. It is an important issue for all those families
                that have been bereaved and, even yet, are still trying coming
                to terms with what has happened to them. Will all the families
                be directly contacted? Will it be left up to the families to
                contact the relatives’ support group or the other organisation
                that was mentioned by a Member earlier? The Department should be
                proactive in this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can the Minister say how many phone calls or
                letters her Department has received in relation to this issue?
                It probably runs into thousands. I know that many people from my
                constituency have contacted the Department about the matter. We
                have had phone calls and letters. That correspondence has also
                been sent to the Minister. Also, will the Minister inform us of
                the people who contacted the Health Department and had to wait
                in long phone-call queues when news of the scandal first broke?
                Have all those people been contacted directly? Have they been
                made aware of whether any of the organs of their loved ones have
                been retained? If so, what steps have been taken to address
                that?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Colleague Mrs Iris Robinson raised the

                middle of this scandal. Can the Minister tell us what steps she
                will be taking to promote organ donation? Many of us carry the
                wee donor cards relating to our kidneys in case we are the
                unfortunate victims of an accident. Many people across the

                concerned? For instance, will there be lay people on the inquiry
                committee, not just doctors and consultants? Finally, the last
                time that the Minister spoke on this matter I think that she
                referred to the organs that are retained by the universities.
                That has not been mentioned in her statement today. Can she give
                us some indication of what has happened to organs retained in

                I never stated — to my recollection— that organs are
                retained in universities. It does not come within my remit, and
                therefore I would not be able to make such a definitive
                statement. As is the practice elsewhere, there are protocols
                between universities and hospitals. That is something that we
                need to look at. My officials will check the Hansard records,
                but I do not believe that I was ever in a position to say such a
                thing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Concerning organ donation, I would refer the
                Member to the answer I gave Kieran McCarthy this morning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards the number of people who contacted
                the Department, very few, to my knowledge, contacted the
                Department directly. To date, the Department has received three
                or four letters and very few calls. The Royal Group of Hospitals
                has had more than 1,000 calls, and Altnagelvin has had a couple
                of hundred. People went directly to the trusts involved rather
                than to the hospitals themselves.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to counselling, the Member
                referred to the point I made about having a counsellor on the
                relatives’ support group. That person would give advice and be
                able to make a contribution to the group in terms of overseeing
                what needs to be done. That is quite separate from the immediate
                action that my Department has already taken — which I outlined
                earlier — to ensure that trusts have been instructed to
                oversee that they put in place measures to take care of the
                needs of those relatives within their trust area, specifically
                the needs of those who live at any distance from the hospitals
                where the organs are retained.</p>

                for all Members when I say that our sympathy and concern goes
                out to all those who have been notified that their relatives’
                organs have been retained. I can think of nothing more
                distressing than for relatives to be told that parts of their

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given the Minister’s statement that no
                organs should be retained without explicit and informed consent,
                does the legislation under which pathologists carried out their
                duties — the Coroners Act 1959 — need immediate updating,
                prior to the inquiry? Will the inquiry also address the Human
                Tissue Act 1962? How was that legislated for in the first place,
                and by whom?</p>

                uppermost in our minds. Underlying all of our actions is our
                utmost desire to do the best we can for them at this point, to
                ensure that the practice — which previously was standard and
                which we now say was unacceptable and must change — does
                change, and that future practice is based firmly on the
                principle of explicit and informed consent.</p>

                the fact that it depends on the legislative will of the

                guidelines are put into place?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have considered the situation of the
                parents involved in these cases — and quite rightly so — but
                these circumstances have also had a devastating effect on
                hospital staff, and they have in some ways been ignored. Those
                working with young children and in the pathology departments
                have felt the effects. We cannot ignore their difficulties, and
                there has to be some reassurance for those caught up in the
                situation through no fault of their own.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask the Minister to ensure that her
                Department does all it can to bring trust back to the hospitals.
                The lack of confidence in organ transplants has already been
                referred to. There should be a separate programme, ongoing with
                the investigation, to reassure people, so that confidence in the
                Health Service is not completely destroyed. It should assure
                them that organ donation is entirely different and separate from
                what has happened in the past.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms de Brún:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the question about guidance, I
                previously said to the House that a copy of the new guidance
                drawn up last year was placed in the Assembly Library. I will
                ensure that the interim guidance is also placed in the Library
                so that Members will have access to it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is not only ongoing monitoring of
                trusts, with trust management monitoring its own performance in
                relation to the current guidance; there will also be interim
                guidance. I do not want to pre-empt the outcome of the review of
                the legislation, but in the spirit of the proposed legislation
                we will be bringing forward, we will ensure that the interim
                guidance covers hospital practice. That will clearly signal to
                the public our intention to ensure that present hospital
                practice — and not just after the inquiry — will be of the
                highest possible standard.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am mindful of the current position of staff
                who are performing a difficult job in trusts and who are trying
                to cope with a difficult situation. The inquiry will be open so
                that everyone can put their views forward, and that will include
                hospital staff. I will expect trusts to demonstrate that they
                are dealing with this matter fully and openly.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The matter we are discussing has been a
                tragedy for Northern Ireland. I agree with the Chairperson of
                the Health, Social Services and Public Safety Committee in that
                the only thing that would satisfy families would be a full,
                independent public inquiry into this situation. In my own area
                of Altnagelvin the situation became clear only following
                complaints from parents.</p>

                Health, Social Services and Public Safety Committee in the
                inquiry? Secondly, can she assure the House that it will not be
                the case of the medical profession investigating itself?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms de Brún:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I reiterate that this is a full statutory
                inquiry with the powers that any such inquiry has to call for
                evidence, to hold its meetings in public if it feels that this
                is necessary, and to engage with the public. It will be full,
                exhaustive and set up under statute. While I do not want to go
                into the details, I see its being overseen by a lay person
                rather than by someone from the medical profession. Once you set
                up an independent inquiry under statute, it is for the person
                who is named as the head of the inquiry to work on the terms of
                reference. It will therefore be for the inquiry to establish how
                it deals with various groups and representatives and how it
                fulfils its terms of reference, which I will be announcing

                the North/South Ministerial Council waterways meeting held on
                29&nbsp;January 2001 in Scarriff.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure (Mr
                McGimpsey):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second meeting of the North/South
                Ministerial Council in inland waterways sectoral format took
                place in Scarriff, County Clare, on Monday, 29
                January&nbsp;2001. Following nomination by the First Minister
                and the Deputy First Minister, Mr&nbsp;Denis&nbsp;Haughey and I
                represented the Northern Ireland Administration. The Irish
                Government were represented by Síle&nbsp;de&nbsp;Valera TD,
                Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. I am
                making this report on behalf of myself and Mr&nbsp;Haughey who
                has approved the report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The meeting opened with a progress report
                from the interim chief executive of Waterways Ireland,
                Mr&nbsp;John Mahony. The council noted that significant progress
                has been made both in terms of the development of the
                organisation and in progressing works on the ground. On
                Lough&nbsp;Erne a number of public moorings have been completely
                refurbished. A new floating jetty has been placed at Toome on
                the Lower&nbsp;Bann river, and new navigation signs are being
                erected along the river to improve public safety. In the
                Republic of Ireland the Limerick navigation scheme, which is an
                extension to the Shannon navigation, is nearing completion, and
                this will allow mooring in the heart of the city for the first
                time. The council gave its consent to plans from Waterways
                Ireland for compulsory purchase of certain lands necessary for
                improvement of the Shannon navigation. Work is also proceeding
                on restoration of the remaining 34 kilometres of the Royal
                Canal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The council noted that Waterways Ireland had
                received the draft final report on the feasibility of re-opening
                the Ulster Canal prepared by ESB International and Ferguson
                &amp; McIlveen Consultants, and this will be forwarded to the
                sponsoring Departments shortly. The council also noted that
                Waterways Ireland has had useful consultations with Bord Fáilte
                and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and that boating/cruising
                on inland navigations is to be promoted as a separate niche
                market. Waterways Ireland will develop a promotional strategy to
                complement this initiative. Waterways Ireland has also had
                meetings with various user groups, including the Lough&nbsp;Erne
                and Lower&nbsp;Bann advisory committees, and it facilitated the
                Erne boat rally and the Youth Cruise 2000 from Killaloe to
                Enniskillen.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the organisational front, good progress
                has been made in getting the headquarters at Enniskillen and the
                regional offices at Dublin, Carrick-on-Shannon and Scarriff up
                and running. There are now 22 non-industrial staff based at
                Enniskillen, while Rivers Agency continues to undertake the
                operational work in Northern Ireland under a service level
                agreement. Two premises at Darling&nbsp;Street and Belmore&nbsp;Street
                in Enniskillen town centre have been leased to meet the body’s
                interim accommodation requirements. The council agreed that
                Waterways Ireland should pursue negotiations on five possible
                site options for the permanent headquarters, which will be a
                waterfront development of around 25,000 square feet. The council
                also approved the options for permanent premises for the three
                regional offices.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An open competition for the post of permanent
                chief executive was completed, and the council confirmed the
                appointment of Mr&nbsp;John&nbsp;Martin as the new chief
                executive of Waterways Ireland. The council also approved
                proposed sterling pay scales for Waterways Ireland, which will
                enable direct recruitment of staff to proceed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The council noted that the provisional
                expenditure out-turn for the 2000 calendar year was estimated at
                approximately £8·5&nbsp;million, compared to the original
                budget of £10·5&nbsp;million. This difference is largely due
                to the impact of the suspension of the devolved arrangements,
                which caused a delay in the recruitment of staff to the body.
                The council also considered and agreed Waterways Ireland’s
                draft action plan for 2001, which included the programme of work
                and budgetary requirements. The proposed budget for 2001 is
                £18·8&nbsp;million, and Northern Ireland’s contribution will
                be approximately £2·6&nbsp;million.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Waterways Ireland’s main objectives for the
                coming year are the effective management and operation of the
                inland navigations for which it is responsible, the development
                of the organisation, the implementation of a capital development
                programme and meeting equality objectives and new targeting
                social need (TSN) goals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Waterways Ireland plans to have 75% of all
                posts within the body filled by December&nbsp;2001, and it will
                introduce new financial management and human resource systems to
                support the development of an effective corporate organisation.
                The council was pleased to note that Waterways Ireland will be
                involved in hosting the World Canals Conference in
                May&nbsp;2001, with venues in Dublin, Belfast and Lisburn. This
                will provide an excellent opportunity to promote Ireland’s
                inland waterways to overseas visitors. The council also approved
                Waterways Ireland’s plans to undertake a review of health and
                safety standards on all navigations and to complete a
                preliminary assessment of the by-laws for all navigations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The North/South Ministerial Council approved
                Waterways Ireland’s draft equality scheme, which includes a
                five-year programme for screening all policies and procedures,
                conducting and consulting on equality impact assessments and
                monitoring. The scheme will now be submitted to the Equality
                Commission. The council also gave its approval for Waterways
                Ireland to proceed to public consultation on its new draft TSN
                action plan.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The council agreed to meet again in sectoral
                format before summer&nbsp;2001.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s statement. There
                has been considerable progress on practical matters, not least
                on consultation between the two tourist boards. I am, however,
                interested in the Minister’s comments on the report by
                Ferguson &amp; McIlveen on the Ulster Canal. Can he forecast the
                commitment that he and his Department will make to the Ulster
                Canal project? I am aware that that might be difficult for him
                at this stage, but we will soon be in a position in which, if we
                are to move forward with this project, he can discuss
                commitment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate Mr&nbsp;John&nbsp;Martin on
                his appointment as chief executive of Waterways Ireland. Can the
                Minister give us a date by which the whole project will be fully
                operational, with staffing and permanent sites in place, both in
                the regions and at headquarters? He has indicated the date by
                which 75% of operational staff will be in place.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I said in my report, the updated
                feasibility study report by ESB International and Ferguson &amp;
                McIlveen has been completed in draft form. I have not yet
                received it in the Department, but I expect that to happen
                within the next week or two. We will then assess what the report
                says and look at the implications. I have previously said in the
                House that the Ulster Canal is one of the key capital projects
                of the future for Waterways Ireland. Half of the canal lies in
                the Irish Republic, and half lies in Northern Ireland; so, when
                it is completed, it will connect Lough&nbsp;Neagh to the
                Erne/Shannon waterways, which will link with the Royal Canal,
                when it is finally completed, and, thus, right through to
                Dublin. The Lagan navigation will be the last remaining scheme
                to be completed before a complete system, running right through
                the island, is created.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The canal is a huge resource in terms of its
                tourist potential. That is now properly recognised by the
                tourist board.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So the Member is right: I cannot give a
                commitment. The original costs specified in 1998 were around
                £70 million, and I suspect that if we were to go forward with
                this, we would probably be talking about roughly £100 million.
                There is a major problem with how we address resources, so
                Members should not expect me to give a commitment now. I will
                say that the Department, Waterways Ireland and I have a
                commitment to proceed with the Ulster Canal project as best we
                can; it is a key capital project.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have already said that the operation of the
                body was delayed because of suspension. We anticipate that it
                will be up to full staff — a total of 381 — by 2002. It is
                building rapidly now, and we are progressing very well, although
                this involves moving staff in from other Departments, which
                takes time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sites have been identified for the offices
                outside headquarters. The headquarters office will take slightly
                longer. The developer’s brief is out at the minute, and a
                number of sites have been identified. The decision will be made
                by way of a bidding process, but that is being handled by the
                property services branch of the Department of the Environment,
                and that is out of my control. It will come forward with its
                preferred options in due course, and then we will proceed.
                However, I suspect that it would not be unreasonable to expect
                to see headquarters fully up and functional within two to three
                years.</p>

                Ministerial meetings on Waterways, or has that changed? David
                Trimble told his party executive that UUP Ministers will no
                longer participate in North/South Ministerial meetings. Can the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The World Canals Conference is a very
                prestigious one, and we all rightly welcome the fact that it is
                coming and that Waterways Ireland will host it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not aware of how the venues were
                selected, but I do know, for example, that Lisburn Borough
                Council spent large sums of money on its section of the Lagan
                navigation. Presumably Dublin and Belfast were chosen because
                they are the two main cities. However, I do not know exactly why
                those venues were selected for the conference.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with the Member’s comments about
                tourist co-operation. One of the main reasons is the huge
                tourist potential that exists for this type of resource when it
                is properly in place. Experience in other parts of Europe, not
                least in the Irish Republic, demonstrates that genuine tourist
                jobs are available when this type of resource is put in place
                properly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The question of a Sinn Féin representative
                is a matter for the First Minister, and I believe that he has
                responded to it within the last few days. It is not my
                responsibility to nominate Ministers.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr J Wilson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s report, which is
                informative and interesting. Considering the disaster of the two
                major fish kills at the trout hatchery at Florencecourt on the
                Erne in recent days, perhaps the Minister, like me, will think
                that a question about a North/South meeting of Waterways Ireland
                is relatively unimportant. However, my question is important to
                the future use of Lough Erne as a fishery and as recreational
                water. I hope that the Minister is in a position to elaborate on
                the nature and extent of progress on the refurbishment of Lough
                Erne’s moorings.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to tease out Mr ONeill’s
                earlier question. A recent newspaper report suggested that as
                early as October 2001, the Minister, along with his counterpart
                in the Republic and Waterways Ireland, may be in a position to
                make optimistic sounds about the future of the Ulster Canal. How
                optimistic is the Minister about having positive news about the
                reopening of the Ulster Canal as early as October?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will take the three elements of the
                question and answer them in reverse order.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not have a great deal to add about the
                Ulster Canal other than to say that, as indicated to Mr ONeill,
                the draft report will be with the Department shortly, and we
                will assess it. I am not aware of any newspaper report. However,
                we will deal with the report and issue it as quickly as
                possible. I give an undertaking to Mr ONeill and to Mr J Wilson
                that as soon as I am able to, I will share the report with the
                Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr J Wilson is right when he says that there
                has been another major disaster on the Erne at the Melvin
                Enhancement Company’s hatchery. Although this falls outside
                the remit of Waterways Ireland, it would be wrong not to mention
                the incident, since Waterways Ireland, the Erne and the Melvin
                Enhancement Company complement each other in that they seek
                tourist revenue and jobs. An earlier pollution incident killed
                large numbers of fish, and, more recently, an act of wanton
                vandalism poisoned thousands. That is a tragedy for a
                non-profit-making facility that promotes Lough Erne’s
                genetically pure brown trout, a natural strain of fish which is
                a major selling point for the future of our fisheries. It is an
                absolute disgrace that not only have thousands of fish been
                killed, but jobs have also been lost.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Capital works in the Irish Republic are the
                responsibility of the Government in Dublin. Capital works in
                Northern Ireland are the responsibility of the Government here.
                Work is ongoing through the Rivers Agency and the Department of
                Agriculture and Rural Development on public jetties on Lough
                Erne at Muckross, Ballinaleck, Magho and Inish Davar, and on a
                new floating jetty on the Lower Bann at Toome. Work will
                continue on the refurbishment of jetties and on the maintenance
                of navigation markers, et cetera, and we are also looking at
                plans to review existing navigations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So if there is not a programme in place, one
                is certainly being built up. We are aware that our canal system
                is embryonic compared to the Irish Republic’s, on which large
                sums of money have recently been spent. We have much work to do.
                As I have already said, there is a resource implication, yet it
                remains an exciting project and possibility, not just because of
                the recreational value to people living here, but also because
                of its potential for earning revenue from tourists.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gallagher:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report indicates that significant
                progress has been made with the inland waterways body. The
                headquarters is located in County Fermanagh, and I would like to
                ask the Minister how many people are employed there, and whether
                his Department has employment targets for the headquarters for
                the next year?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I join with the Minister in condemning what
                appears to have been a deliberate act of putting chemicals into
                the water system at the hatchery. As he said, we are all
                concerned about possible job losses, and I have no doubt that
                some will result from that. We have to keep in mind that many
                people have worked over the years in a voluntary capacity to
                bring this into being. It is deplorable that so much effort has
                been wasted. Is the Minister in a position to say if he is
                satisfied, given that a poison was put into the system, that
                adequate measures are in place to contain it, as the system
                feeds into larger and wider systems important for fishing and
                other considerations?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I said on a previous occasion, it is
                anticipated that 70 people will be employed at headquarters.
                Mr&nbsp;Gallagher is quite right. Look at the size of
                Enniskillen and compare the number of jobs there with the number
                that would be created pro rata in Belfast: hundreds or thousands
                of jobs. Enniskillen is a small town, and 70&nbsp;jobs will have
                a real economic impact.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not aware of the precise size of the
                workforce. I think it is currently about 18, but building
                rapidly. It might be more than that now. I previously reported
                18, so it probably is more than that now. We expect headquarters
                to reach its proper complement within the year, as recruitment
                is ongoing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As far as the hatchery is concerned, I agree
                with the Member that that has an important implication for
                tourist jobs on down the line. I am satisfied that the issue is
                being properly addressed. The RUC and the company have been
                active in investigating the incident, and the company is not
                doing anything other than what it is supposed to. I have visited
                the facility, and I am quite sure that it takes environmental
                issues very seriously. While I cannot be absolutely specific
                about the volume of poison released into the watercourses, I am
                sure that if that is what happened, it was not due to any
                negligence on the part of the management but rather to an act of
                wanton vandalism.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister has already recognised the great
                benefits of water-based tourism, to which the inland waterways
                report that he has brought to the Chamber testifies. Many in the
                Province, even those without canals in their area, recognise the
                tourism spin-off. The Minister spoke about the Ulster Canal as
                just one of the projects. That is one that the Culture, Arts and
                Leisure Committee has looked at and supports. We would like to
                see how it would work. Has the Minister received any indications
                about funding? Will it come from private sources, or will some
                of it come from the Government? We would also like to see the
                economic benefit and spin-offs that will come to all the areas
                — bed-and-breakfast accommodation, restaurants and cafés in
                all the small villages and areas along the edge of canals.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Lough Erne is not the only place with
                attractive areas for boating and water-based activities. Will
                other parts of the Province also benefit? What role does the
                Northern Ireland Tourist Board have in promoting the waterways?
                I hope that they make a much better job of promoting the
                waterways than they have with angling.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to take up two other issues mentioned
                by the Minister. First, he said that Waterways Ireland
                underspent its budget for the calendar year 2000 by some £2
                million. Expenditure was £8·5 million, and the original budget
                was £10·5 million. Will that £2 million be carried over into
                the second year, or is it lost?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, he said that the Rivers Agency
                continues to undertake operational work in Northern Ireland
                under a service level agreement. Does the Rivers Agency have the
                necessary finance to carry out the work sufficiently and to the
                benefit of tourism? Tourism is a big thing in all of our
                constituencies, and I hope that we will all see the benefits. As
                the Minister lives in my constituency — or at least in the
                same district council area — I am sure that, like myself, he
                will want to see tourism promoted in Strangford.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am very keen to see tourism enhanced in
                Strangford — indeed, in all parts of Northern Ireland. I have
                to remind the House that Waterways Ireland is purely a
                navigation body, dealing with navigable waterways. Currently,
                there are no navigable waterways under the control of Waterways
                Ireland in Strangford. There is the Ulster Canal, the Lagan
                navigation and the Newry/Portadown Canal, although it has its
                own challenges. There is also a canal at Coalisland and the
                Lower Bann navigation. Once those are navigable, Waterways
                Ireland will take them over.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Northern Ireland Tourist Board (NITB)
                takes promotion seriously, working in co-operation with Bord
                Fáilte on this initiative and in promoting this resource
                worldwide. I cannot comment, as the NITB is not answerable to my
                Department — it is answerable to Sir Reg Empey and the
                Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment — but I have no
                doubt that it takes its responsibilities seriously. I cannot
                comment on how it has performed in the past, but everybody has
                room for improvement, including ourselves.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is an underspend of £2 million in the
                budget, which will be carried over and not lost. I am not clear
                on the exact mechanism, but it will be carried over to the next
                financial year. Normally within Government here, unspent money
                goes back to the centre for redistribution. I assume that that
                is the principle. I will write to the Member on that, giving the
                precise mechanism for ensuring that the money is not lost.</p>

                meeting that he described was very welcome. What possible sites
                for the permanent headquarters are under discussion?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In point 7 of the statement there is a
                reference to the very negative impact of the last suspension of
                political institutions on the progress of the body and that it
                was particularly detrimental in the area of staff recruitment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister agree that the collapse of
                political institutions, wilfully being planned for by his own
                party leadership, ahead of the May election, will similarly have
                a disastrous impact on the progress of Waterways Ireland? Did
                the Minister inform the inland waterways sectoral meeting of the
                council of his party leader’s intention to continue the
                illegal ban on nominating Sinn Fein Ministers to the council?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Five sites are currently being considered for
                the permanent headquarters in Enniskillen. Two are adjacent on
                the Sligo road; one is on the water’s edge, close to the
                Ardhowen theatre; one is at Derrychara, opposite the Erneside
                shopping centre, and the other, known as the Brooke, is in the
                centre of the town.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I strongly believe that there should be a
                waterfront development. It will be of around 25,000&nbsp;square
                feet. In other words, it will be for customers, users and
                tourists and not simply an office accommodation for staff.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the other part of the
                question, about the collapse of political institutions —
                institutions that we are all striving to retain — the Member
                talked about the collapses &quot;being planned for&quot;. Well,
                he probably knows more about that than I do. I know of nobody in

                institutions.</p>

                as the Member put it, at the meeting in Scarriff in County Clare
                two weeks ago, we stuck to the agenda of Waterways Ireland. This
                was the North/South Ministerial Council in sectoral format; we

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards the development of waterways and,
                as Mr Shannon mentioned, funding for this, funding will
                obviously have to be in the form of some cocktail of public,
                private and European money, and that mix of funding will be able
                to be determined only as things are developed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member is right to say that there are
                powers of compulsory purchase in the Republic. There will also
                be powers of compulsory purchase in Northern Ireland if we find
                it necessary, for example, to further advance the re-creation of
                the Ulster Canal, since large parts of it have been abandoned.
                It is anticipated that there is a possibility that compulsory
                purchase may be necessary. I hope that it is not; that is
                something which should be done only as a last resort.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The industrial heritage of Northern Ireland
                is an important issue and one that is very much in our minds as
                we develop the waterways. As we go forward, things like
                environmental assessments will have to be done — indeed,
                environmental proofing has already been done in respect of the
                Ulster Canal, and that will become more concentrated and focused
                as we move forward with different parts of the canal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The environmental heritage aspects of our
                canals need to be safeguarded. It is important to reach a
                balance between preserving the heritage features of former
                canals, protecting natural environment and providing for modern
                cruising needs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will have the formal environmental impact
                assessment, but we need to see waterways developed as living
                assets which cater for modern usage with appropriate
                environmental safeguards. It cannot simply be the preservation
                of historic features for historic purposes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When they were originally constructed, canals
                were used by narrow-gauge barges dragged by horses. I do not
                think that anyone is suggesting that there should be a
                horse-drawn canal resource in Northern Ireland — that would be
                the wrong way to approach the matter. As I said, we must try to
                safeguard them all, but we need a balance. For example, modern
                boats are wider than the original narrow-gauge barges. If the
                canal is made solely for narrow-gauge barges, it will
                effectively preclude, for example, all the boats currently
                available for hire on Lough Erne.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A balance must be struck and found. We will
                attempt to do that. Another feature of a modern canal system is
                the use of card technology to operate the lock, rather that a
                lock-keeper with a wheel and a handle to turn. Therefore
                although it will be a modern system catering for modern usage,
                it will preserve and be informed by historic features. However,
                they will not be preserved purely for historic purposes, but
                also as living assets catering for modern usage.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I too want to comment on the exciting
                potential of this initiative and body. My question has been
                partially clarified already. It relates to the tourism potential
                of Waterways Ireland. Will it focus simply on tourism for its
                revenue, or is there scope, for example, for freight and
                passenger transport to be used on these waterways? Is that
                possibility being examined?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not aware that freight carriage has been
                examined. I am not sure that that would be viable, but I have no
                doubt that if the canals were operating, it would happen if the
                operators decided that it was viable. Market forces would
                determine that type of matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not just about tourism, of course.
                There is a strong element of economic regeneration, particularly
                in the countryside. Members may recollect that by and large,
                canals go through areas of countryside that are often deprived
                and far from urban areas. The issue of new targeting social need
                (TSN) is also strongly addressed through the regeneration of the
                canals and the economic regeneration of rural communities. When
                we make the case for resources, one of our arguments will be
                that this type of investment addresses TSN.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue is much wider than simply tourism,
                but, as I said, we focused on tourism. Obviously, this is worth
                doing. There are recreational aspects for the local community
                too, but economic regeneration can act as a generator in the
                countryside, and that has been the experience in the Irish
                Republic. I have no doubt that that will be our experience too.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Carson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s report on the
                second sectoral meeting of Waterways Ireland and several points
                in particular which concern the constituency of Fermanagh and
                South Tyrone. The feasibility study on the canal is especially
                welcome, because it would open up tourism in that area. I also
                welcome the creation of some jobs in the Fermanagh and
                Enniskillen areas, and, in particular, the refurbishment of
                public moorings on the Lough Erne system. Any improvement to the
                moorings will help the local boating, angling and, especially,
                tourism communities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask the Minister to seek the development of
                more moorings and jetties for the Lough Erne system at the next
                sectoral meeting. The matter should be high on the agenda. We
                need more moorings and jetties. A large number of boats are
                coming into the Erne system, and there are not always sufficient
                places for tourists to tie up. That is particularly important,
                and I encourage him to put that on the agenda.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I notice that boating and cruising on the
                system is to be promoted as a separate niche market and I
                welcome that. However, cruise firms on the Lough Erne system
                have had a particularly hard time in recent years because of the
                disparity between the punt and the pound and many bookings are
                going to the South of Ireland. The Minister said that that has
                nothing to do with him, but something should be done to help and
                encourage the hire firms in the Fermanagh area.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not that the disparity between the punt
                and the pound has nothing to do with me, it is something that is
                out of my control and out of the control of the Assembly.
                However, it is a matter that focuses minds, not just in this
                situation, but in others also. There has been some coming
                together in the currencies, but there is still a very large
                disparity. I am not entirely clear how that matter should be
                addressed other than by providing a product in Fermanagh that is
                second to none.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to Waterways Ireland, some of the
                ongoing work will carry through the capital programme for 2001.
                For example, they are refurbishing jetties on the Erne, and
                there is ongoing maintenance of navigation markers. There is
                also a review of the Bann, with a new pair of lock gates going
                in on the Lower Bann. There is the construction and completion
                of works on the Shannon navigation at Limerick City. So, the
                ongoing work is enhancing the entire system, and it includes the
                construction of the first of six road bridges on the Royal Canal
                to allow the canal to enter the system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once the system gets into operation, all
                parts of it will benefit. I have no doubt that Lough Erne and
                Fermanagh will benefit as well — as they have done to an
                extent already with the location of headquarters and staff in
                Enniskillen.</p>

                user groups, and the Minister has named two as examples. Will he
                further expand on this information, particularly from the
                Northern Ireland context, including the ports? Will he also
                indicate how much of the £18·8 million action plan budget for
                2001 will be of direct benefit to Northern Ireland?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I reported on the user groups and gave those
                examples because I understand that Waterways Ireland has been
                dealing with a number of user groups. I cannot give an
                exhaustive list here, because I do not have the information with
                me. If the Member wishes, I can provide him with that
                information.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of the £8·5&nbsp;million capital
                expenditure for this year, Northern Ireland’s contribution is
                £750,000. The £8·5 million will provide, for example, for the
                organisation as a whole, £3·45&nbsp;million for capital,
                £4&nbsp;million for maintenance and £1&nbsp;million for
                administration, professional and technical staff. I cannot be
                precise as to staff numbers, but they are increasing rapidly
                this year from 18 to 250 as people come in from various
                Government bodies and agencies, both in the Republic and in
                Northern Ireland. Next year those numbers will increase again.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are responsible for capital projects
                within Northern Ireland. So, for example, the funding for the
                Lagan navigation and our half of the Ulster Canal will have to
                be found within Northern Ireland. Mr&nbsp;Shannon made a point
                about funding. I anticipate a cocktail of public and private
                finance, with, perhaps, money also coming from Europe or other
                sources.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot say how capital will be drawn down
                or how capital resources will be addressed in the future. At the
                moment, the main project is the new headquarters in Enniskillen.
                I am not sure how many millions that will cost, but it will be a
                substantial building on the waterfront, comprising 25,000 square
                feet.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure
                is also considering the Ulster Canal and other capital projects
                that I mentioned, such as the refurbishment of jetties and the
                construction of new floating jetties. That work programme will
                continue to develop. I shall keep the House and the Culture,
                Arts and Leisure Committee informed as appropriate.</p>

                I welcome the Minister’s statement; it shows that progress has
                been made. It is important that Waterways Ireland make progress.
                It is unfortunate, however, that Fermanagh will not be a venue
                for the World Canals Conference. Fermanagh has been the home of
                Waterways Ireland for some time and has a strong connection with
                the subject, through the Ballyconnell Canal, one of the better
                recent developments. However, I am sure that that link will be
                developed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A statement from the Minister’s Colleague,
                Denis Haughey, about the Coalisland Canal has already appeared
                in the press. What progress has been made on linking the
                Coalisland Canal to the Ulster Canal, assuming that that project
                progresses as the Minister envisages? The reopening of the
                Ulster Canal is an important step in the opening of the
                waterways. As the Minister says, it is important that we have a
                working canal, not just one of historical interest.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problems with attracting tourists could
                be eased by the introduction of a single currency. As one
                solution, the Minister could endorse an all-Ireland strategy and
                policy that would ensure that there was one currency throughout
                the island of Ireland. As an interim solution, we could use the
                euro. In the long term, we must focus on the all-Ireland
                dimension if Waterways Ireland is to attract visitors to the
                island of Ireland.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member mentioned the disparity between
                the punt and the pound. He has a particular political view on
                that, and it is one that I do not share. It is also a view —
                if I must make a political point — that most people in
                Northern Ireland do not share. That is what the agreement and
                the projects and processes that we are working on are about.
                That kind of financial issue is important, but not so
                overwhelmingly important as to justify changing our entire
                political philosophy, however much the Member might desire that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have nothing to add about the World Canals
                Conference, but as I receive information I shall share it with
                the Committee and with Mr Molloy. The Department recognises
                Fermanagh’s importance, which is why the headquarters is in
                Enniskillen. The conference will consider experience and best
                practice in other parts of the world and will try to benefit
                from those.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have received a number of inquiries about
                the Coalisland Canal. It is the responsibility of the Department
                of Culture, Arts and Leisure, not Waterways Ireland. There are
                no plans for it at present, because resources are not available.
                However, there is no question of allowing that property — some
                4 kilometres long — to disappear from the Department’s
                control. The Department has custodial responsibility and will
                maintain that. I share the aspiration that the Coalisland Canal
                can again become the navigation that it once was.</p>

                amendment and advised Members that I might wish to tidy it up at
                the Further Consideration Stage. The amendment I have tabled
                introduces minor revisions of the wording to maintain
                consistency with the other provisions in the Bill, but does not
                alter the effect of the sub-paragraph.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That this Assembly calls on those Ministers
                responsible to make compensation available for farmers who are
                suffering financially as a result of the Silent Valley sheep ban
                in the Mournes.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps before I begin, Mr Speaker, I could
                raise a point of order. As you can see from the wording of the
                motion I am clearly asking that Ministers — plural — be in
                attendance and the wording of the motion was designed to achieve
                that. I understand that the Minister for Regional Development is
                going to respond to the motion, and I thank him for that.
                However, both Ministers who have a direct responsibility, the
                Minister for Regional Development and the Minister for
                Agriculture and Rural Development, indicated that they wanted to
                participate in the debate, and I phrased the motion in such a
                way that they could.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. The Member may choose to phrase the
                motion whatever way he likes, but that does not make it in order
                for more than one Minister to respond to it. It is not in order
                to do so, save in the exceptional circumstances of the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister who have a different
                constitutional position.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is only in order for one Minister to
                respond on behalf of the Executive. It may be one Minister or
                another, but it can only be one Minister. If it were to be more
                than one Minister, it could be two, and there are other
                circumstances in which it could be three or more. The House
                could be in a dilemma if each Minister did not say precisely the
                same thing and the question for the House in those circumstances
                would be, &quot;Which Minister spoke for the Executive?&quot;
                That is not a dilemma which I wish to place before the House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Indeed, as the Member himself will be aware,
                in this particular matter, and with respect to the two Ministers
                he is speaking of, he had the problem of two Ministers appearing
                to say different things and laid it upon my shoulders to seek
                some resolution of the matter. Not wanting to voluntarily put
                myself in that position again, nor place the Assembly in such a
                position on this or any other matter, I have made the ruling
                that one Minister shall be responsible for responding. On this
                occasion, the Minister who has come forward — and I assume it
                has been agreed that he will respond — is the Minister for
                Regional Development, who is in his place.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Undoubtedly I will get an opportunity to
                include a few comments in response as I go through what I have
                to say on the issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I welcome the opportunity to bring
                this issue to the attention of the Assembly. It is one that has
                been affecting sheep farmers in the particular catchment area of
                the Silent Valley for some time now. The matter should have been
                before us a bit earlier because of its inherent urgency. The
                particular farmers involved have been faced with huge
                difficulties regarding the grazing of their sheep and this has
                lead to immense financial problems. It is time someone took
                responsibility for compensating those farmers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another matter causing me huge concern —
                and I mentioned it under a point of order but will include it
                now as part of my speech — is the fact that, although my
                motion calls on all Ministers responsible, there is only one
                Minister here to respond to the motion. If my motion was
                accepted as genuine for tabling before Members today then it
                should have included a response from all Ministers responsible.
                That is not a ruling I can make, but it is my view nevertheless.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. It is commonplace to refer to more
                than one Minister in motions. In questions and in motions in
                other places the reference is most commonly to, in that
                situation, Her Majesty’s Government, which consists of many
                Ministers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, only one Minister will reply on
                behalf of the Executive. The fact that more than one Minister is
                referred to in the Member’s motion is entirely competent and
                proper. He may refer to the responsibilities of a number of
                Ministers, and to their actions. That is also entirely proper
                and in order, but it is nevertheless the case that only one
                Minister will respond. I trust that I have made that clear.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thank you, Mr Speaker. I now realise why we
                put such burdens on such strong shoulders.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before I continue with the substantive part
                of the motion, there is another issue that has caused me serious
                concern outside this Chamber. There was a news report this
                morning about sheep grazing in the catchment area. It caused me
                considerable concern because, according to the report, this has
                been going on for some time. Why did they choose to issue that
                report today? It creates a big question mark in my mind. Is it
                an attempt to deflect attention from the real issue? Who
                encouraged the media to look at that issue yesterday? What was
                the reason behind it?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The real issue here is the 115 farmers
                suffering, in some cases, an estimated loss of £4,320 — that
                has been worked out by an agricultural expert. There are two
                issues that I must explain for the benefit of Members. First of
                all, by not having their sheep on the mountain, the farmers lose
                out on grants that they would otherwise be entitled to.
                Secondly, because the farmers have had to take their sheep off
                the mountain, they have had to use their lowland pastures to
                graze the sheep. Consequently they have not been able to obtain
                their winter fodder stock, and they have had to buy in food to
                keep their sheep going. That is where most of the farmers have
                incurred their biggest loss.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have said, on the record, that I appreciate
                the Water Service’s attempt to prevent cryptosporidium from
                reaching the drinking water of my constituents and those of my
                Colleagues. However, in an effort to distance itself from the
                obvious evidence that the Silent Valley was not adequately
                protected against such infection, and that the conduit running
                from the reservoir for some 35 miles was leaking, the Department
                has ensured that the sheep farmers have shouldered all the
                blame.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why was this reservoir not adequately
                protected against infection, when every other reservoir in the
                area is? Why was the conduit allowed to fall into such
                disrepair? And why, when officials have admitted that there is
                no evidence to link these animals to the infection, are farmers
                now paying the price for the inadequacies of others?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All the evidence strongly suggests that the
                conduit was to blame for the infection. I would like to explain.
                The old conduit from the Silent Valley, which brings the mains
                supply into areas of South Belfast, Lisburn and north Down, is
                gravity-fed. That means that if a crack or a break occurs in the
                line, it will suck in material from outside as it passes. The
                new conduit, which is currently being installed, has a
                pressurised component that ensures that if a crack occurs, it
                will force the water out, thus not allowing outside
                contamination to enter.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This was far away from the Silent Valley.

                be replaced, indicating an urgency to get rid of the damaged
                section. If it were all the fault of the sheep, why would the
                Water Service go to such lengths? The report confirms that</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;outbreaks of water-related
                cryptosporidiosis do not just happen. There appears to be a
                strong correlation between outbreaks and situations where an
                inadequacy was identified in the treatment provided, or in the
                operation of the treatment process.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The difficulty for the public in all of this
                is to fully realise that, even today, the actual source of that
                original outbreak is not traceable and remains presently
                untraceable, which must be a cause for major public concern. I
                have a letter from the Water Service dated 13&nbsp;September
                2000, which states</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The link between the grazing of sheep
                and the risk of cryptosporidium in the water supplies is well
                established.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no further explanation. This infers
                that the link was firmly established, although this report says
                that it was not. In a meeting with Health and Social Services
                officials in November to discuss the report published by the
                Eastern Health and Social Services Board, Dr Liz Mitchell
                informed me that, in the Silent Valley case, there was
                absolutely no evidence to link the faeces of the sheep with the
                cryptosporidium outbreak.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Surprisingly, not one of the sheep that
                traditionally graze on the mountains was ever tested. One would
                have thought that to find out whether these animals were the
                cause, the simple and honest thing to do would be to test them.
                Not one of them has been tested. Why? Surely the Department
                wants to pinpoint the culprit. Perhaps the reason for this —
                and this is an interesting sign that all of the things that go
                on in Departments are not necessarily the Ministers’
                responsibility — is to be seen in Mr&nbsp;Campbell’s
                admission that the Department was under pressure from the media
                and had to come up with an answer immediately. Mr&nbsp;Campbell
                stated in a letter to you, Mr&nbsp;Speaker, in response to the
                very issues that you were raising to me with those broad
                shoulders earlier, on 12&nbsp;January&nbsp;2001 that</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the decision to extend the ban had, in
                fact, emerged more quickly than intended, due to questioning of
                officials in the media on 4 September.&quot;</p>

                Development? Is it the Minister or the ‘Belfast Telegraph’?
                Mr&nbsp;Campbell made this statement in an attempt to explain
                what appeared to me to be his misleading the House. Now you have
                decided, Mr&nbsp;Speaker, that he did not deliberately mislead
                the House. Mr&nbsp;Campbell admits that he did not consult with
                the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development before he
                made the decision to extend the ban. He maintains that both he
                and his officials did liaise with that Department’s officials.
                He stated in this Chamber on 11&nbsp;September&nbsp;2000 that
                they had liaised and were continuing to liaise with the
                Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. I do not know
                what kind of liaisons he referred to, but they are certainly not
                to the benefit of our farmers. To liaise means to communicate
                and co-operate. To consult means to seek advice. I do not think
                there is a huge difference. Mr Campbell and his officials did
                not consult the Department of Agriculture. Had they done so —</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. The motion
                before us calls on the Ministers to provide financial
                compensation to the farmers affected. I have prepared my
                contribution on that basis. The Member for South Down has had
                some time, but it all seems to be an attack on the Minister for
                Regional Development and his handling of this case. As far as I
                can see, the Member has not as yet dealt with the motion. How
                much more time will he be given before he comes to the subject
                of the debate?</p>

                is to see things coming to their point and conclusion. I am sure
                that the proposer of the motion has heard what the Member has
                said.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before the point of order, I was trying to
                make a very important point. I will make it again. Had there
                been proper consultation between the two Departments, Regional
                Development would have been aware that had it waited until
                earlier this year before making its decision, the Department of
                Agriculture could this year have introduced the <i>force majeure</i>
                regulations that last year secured the grant aid, thereby
                preventing its loss. Members, therefore — like Mr Wells, who
                made the point of order — would not have to go around using
                sleight of hand methods to find some other way round the
                regulations to restore the situation. They could have been
                dealing with it frankly, honestly and openly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I said, the loss of that grant could have
                been avoided. There was a lack of consultation. Those who did
                not embark on consultation are therefore directly responsible
                for that loss of income. That is where the buck should finally
                stop.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The loss of subsidies is not the only
                concern. One of the most serious implications in all of this is
                that the tradition of sheep farming in the Mournes is likely to
                become extinct as a result of this ban. The Water Service has
                decided that the sheep will not be allowed back onto the
                mountain until the barrier is complete. The estimated date is
                2003-04 and this, as we all know from our experience of forward
                planning, is probably a very optimistic target. Lambs born in
                that period will not have the chance to learn from their mothers
                where or how to graze a particular piece of land.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members should be aware that the grazing
                tradition in the Mournes is very old indeed. It is probably
                early, or even pre-Christian, in origin. The practice was known
                as &quot;booleying&quot;, where farmers, their families and
                their flocks moved entirely from the lowlands in the spring or
                early summer to graze the higher Mournes. They have done that
                for generations untold. Evidence can still be seen in the higher
                Mournes, where there are little round patches. Those were the
                sites of the booley huts. That has come down to us from that
                period. If the sheep do not know which area to graze in, and if
                they are simply put up on the mountain, they will wander all
                over the place.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They could turn up in Rostrevor, Kilkeel, or
                anywhere. It is important each year that the lambs go up with
                their mothers, and graze the same areas that their mothers
                grazed in the past, so that they know where the grazing is. The
                circle will be broken if that does not happen, and the old
                tradition will be lost forever.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If and when the filter-bed is put in place
                and sheep are allowed to return to the Mournes it will just not
                be possible to operate that system. In those circumstances, a
                meagre request might be for the Department to relent on its
                decision during those months that everyone has established as
                representing the least hazard — August, September and early
                October. That might be sufficient to allow the pasturage
                tradition to continue. The Minister might consider relenting
                somewhat on that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I come back to the overall issue of
                compensation. The farmers themselves are now seeing their
                livelihoods disappearing before their very eyes. Of the 115-odd
                farmers involved in farming in the Mournes, not everyone is as
                dependent on the grazing as others are. However, a large number
                of those farmers are facing financial ruin because of the sheep
                grazing being removed. As a direct result of the ban, for
                example, farmers have to use extra fertiliser —</p>

                the fact that this is a time-limited debate. There are a number
                of other Members who wish to contribute, and there is also the
                Minister’s winding-up speech. We are now 20 minutes into the
                90-minute debate, so I ask the Member to draw his remarks to a
                close.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad of the instruction. As a direct
                result of the ban, farmers are having to use extra fertiliser
                and are losing out on silage as animals have eaten up their
                winter feed. To pay for these factors the farmers are selling
                lambs and cattle at a much reduced rate and will not be able to
                afford to replace them. One farmer in my constituency can no
                longer afford to pay for childcare or afford to drive the
                children to school. These are genuine hardship cases. He has had
                to take on extra work, and he has even enrolled in an IT course
                because he is considering giving up farming entirely. That is
                after a farming tradition of 300 years in his family. That is
                the reality.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask the Minister for Regional Development
                — who I believe is directly responsible because he issued the
                ban — to come up with a package of compensation, in
                consultation with his Colleagues, to redress the situation and
                help these farmers. They need to be helped through the four or
                five years before they are able to graze their flocks again on
                the Mournes. It is also necessary for that pasturage tradition
                to remain unbroken so that the flocks will know where to go when
                the filter-bed provision is made.</p>

                number of Members that have put their names down to speak, I
                shall not permit Members to go on longer than 10 minutes. The
                Minister responding will have a maximum of 15 minutes, which is
                the normal rule of thumb for a debate lasting an hour and a
                half. Whatever time remains can then be returned to the tender
                mercies of the proposer for his winding-up speech.</p>

                Development Committee (Mr McFarland):</b> Cryptosporidium poses
                a very serious threat to humans, especially the elderly,
                children and the infirm. As many will know, there were two
                attacks last year. The first, in April and May, laid low a
                number of people in Lisburn, Belfast and my own constituency of
                North Down. The second was the famous attack in Lisburn — in
                the Lagmore conduit.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first attack was quite clearly tracked
                back to the water supply from the Silent Valley. It was tracked
                back, as I understand it, to animal causes. Members will recall
                that the scientists were able to identify human causes for the
                Lagmore conduit attack. It is possible to identify where the
                cryptosporidium has come from. It is clear that the initial
                attack in April was from animal sources, and it seems to have
                come from the Silent Valley water supply.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is clearly a need to devise whatever
                protection measures we can to stop this happening. As we
                discovered in the second attack, it is extremely unpleasant and
                very dangerous. It is understandable that the sheep — one
                possible source — were removed from the catchment area. I
                understand the Member for South Down’s concern about losing
                sheep from the Mournes. I was brought up in the Sperrins, and
                the joy of seeing sheep on the mountains is something that
                should be experienced by those who have not done so. However, we
                have to be practical about this. If there is a possibility —
                indeed a strong possibility — that the cryptosporidium came
                from that source, then that source should be removed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is my understanding that farmers have been
                permitted to graze their sheep in the Mourne catchment area,
                although the land belongs to the Department for Regional
                Development — the Water Service. It is a custom and practice
                — a tradition that has grown up — that farmers are allowed,
                between April and October, to graze their sheep on this land.
                Presumably the farmers have land upon which they keep their
                sheep between October and the end of March. It is not as if it
                is the only place where the sheep can be kept. We have a
                concern, a removal of the possible source of cryptosporidium and
                somewhere else that the farmers can keep their sheep.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Compensation, however, is a different matter.
                We have heard an enormous amount, as Mr Wells has already said,
                about where this all went wrong and who is at fault. However,
                the compensation issue is a different one. If we all accept that
                there is a danger and that steps have been taken to nullify
                that, where possible, for a set period until the new measures to
                make sure that the water is absolutely pure are put in place,
                then compensation is a different issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are all concerned. We hear weekly about
                the plight of the farmers. No one can be left untouched by their
                problems at the moment. However, the compensation issue is not
                directly connected to cryptosporidium. There may be a case for
                the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development to look at
                some form of compensation. As anyone who attends this Chamber at
                all regularly will know, the Department for Regional Devlopment’s
                work has been underfunded over many years. It is a potential
                disaster area in terms of cryptosporidium outbreaks. The water
                piping and water treatment plants need to be renewed. There is
                an enormous infrastructure cost. I would rather see any spare
                money that the Minister for Regional Development has going
                towards fixing these pipes against the possible ingress of
                cryptosporidium to make sure that this does not happen again. He
                might encourage the Minister of Agriculture and Rural
                Development to see whether she has a few shekels left to help
                the farmers out.</p>

                Chair)</p>
                </i><b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will be speaking to the motion, unlike
                others who, perhaps, will use it as a vehicle to launch attacks
                on various Departments. One cannot underestimate the devastating
                effect of this ban on sheep farming in the Mournes. One hundred
                and fifteen farmers have been affected and, crucially,
                9,000&nbsp;acres of grazing land have been taken out of
                circulation. It must be emphasised that there is simply no other
                available land in south Down to which farmers can move.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;McFarland asked where farmers keep
                their sheep in winter. In many cases, they are kept under cover
                or in enclosures in which they are fed hay, et cetera. This
                fodder has to be brought in, and farmers simply cannot afford to
                have their sheep enclosed and fed in this expensive way during
                the summer. That simply cannot happen.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Landowners have grazed their animals on this
                area for generations, going as far back as the nineteenth
                century when the land was owned by current farmers’
                great-grandfathers. Many farmers still have the original title
                deeds of this land which state their right to graze animals in
                the Silent Valley catchment area, but when the Belfast Water
                Commissioners decided to build the Silent Valley reservoir,
                those rights were bought out. Nonetheless, a tradition has
                continued whereby the same farmers rent or lease the land for
                grazing on an annual basis. They pay a relatively modest amount
                to a Castlewellan-based estate agent, and at Kilkeel a register
                is kept of the names of those who have grazed the land and for
                how long.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore no absolute legal right obliges the
                Department to allow these farmers to graze. I accept this, but I
                believe that a very strong, moral right, based on previous
                practice, still exists. The ban could not have come at a worse
                time for the farming community of south Down. According to
                estimates, the income of farmers in the peripheral areas of
                Northern Ireland is as low as £22&nbsp;a&nbsp;week. I can
                confirm Mr&nbsp;ONeill’s statement that farmers are in a
                desperate situation at the moment because of this, and because
                of the very low price for sheep meat and wool. I know of one
                farmer who has been forced to get a job delivering ‘Yellow
                Pages’ to try to supplement his income, while others are
                taking jobs in the electoral offices. They are doing anything
                they can to get round this problem. This terrible blow came at a
                time when farmers were already suffering tremendous financial
                stress.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One point that Mr&nbsp;ONeill did not
                highlight is the conservation implications of this ban. A
                certain pattern of grazing is required to sustain the high
                quality environment which exists within the Mourne wall. Too
                much grazing leads to a loss of vegetation, but no grazing at
                all leads to the growth of rank vegetation, which destroys the
                very interesting flora of the area. If there is no grazing over
                the next three&nbsp;or&nbsp;four&nbsp;years, the conservation
                value of the Mournes will be irreparably damaged. It must be
                emphasised that farmers have never been in any way to blame for
                this crisis — they are the innocent victims of the situation.
                But, like Mr&nbsp;ONeill and others, I have been leading various
                delegations to meet with the relevant Ministers. We had a very
                constructive meeting with the Minister of Agriculture and, only
                last week, we had a very useful meeting with the Minister for
                Regional Development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Kelly from the Water Service
                explained in very clear terms the precise dilemma faced by the
                Minister. The law is very clear: it is a criminal offence to
                allow more than one cryptosporidium oocyst per 10&nbsp;litres of
                water. If that were allowed to happen, the Department would be
                liable in law. Once the scientists tested the water and found
                the existence of one oocyst per 10&nbsp;litres, the Department’s
                hands were tied, and it simply had to take action. The Water
                Service informed us last Wednesday that cryptosporidium can be
                clearly traced back to the Silent Valley reservoir and to sheep.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I fully accept Mr&nbsp;ONeill’s assertion
                that doubt still exists, but clearly the doubt is such that, in
                the light of this information, it would have been irresponsible
                of the Minister to fail to take action — and he would not have
                been able to deny knowledge of it. Cryptosporidium is so harmful
                that, as result of a recent outbreak in America, 30&nbsp;people
                died and over 100,000&nbsp;people were infected. Therefore, the
                effects can be more serious than a mild stomach complaint. This
                bug, if it takes effect, particularly in the elderly and the
                infirm, can lead to death.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister found himself in a very
                difficult dilemma, and I can fully understand why he took the
                decision that he did. Mr ONeill makes the point that if he had
                held on a few months, the <i>force majeure</i> regulations would
                have been invoked allowing the sheep to continue to graze. That
                is true, but that would have only been for one more year. We
                would still have been in the same position the following year
                and would have had to ban sheep from grazing. If the Minister
                had knowingly sat on this information for four or five months to
                allow the grazing to continue, and someone had become seriously
                ill or even died as a result, Mr ONeill would have been the
                first to hang the Minister out to dry. We have to look at this
                in a balanced way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept that farmers need to have
                compensation for this. One of the important points that emerged
                from a meeting with the Minister is that no matter how high a
                priority the new treatment plant is given, the very earliest
                date on which it can physically be opened is March 2004, so
                farmers are going to be denied the right to graze for another
                three seasons. That is going to cause enormous hardship. There
                must be some compromise that can be reached which will at least
                enable the farmers to claim their subsidies through their
                Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) forms or
                provide some form of alternative compensation that will give
                them restitution for a situation for which they are not to
                blame.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During our meeting last week we suggested
                various forms of words that could be used to enable the payments
                to be made. Something has to be done soon. As Mr ONeill has
                said, the farmers are not only losing their grazing rights; they
                are also losing a tradition, and they are going to be put to
                enormous expense to restore that grazing tradition to the
                Mournes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is not a situation in which the money is
                not available. The money is there; the budget already provides
                for subsidy payments for the sheep farmers. Some way has to be
                found of coming up with a form of words which will allow that
                money to be transferred to another budget within the Department
                of Agriculture for payment to farmers. If we do not do that, we
                will face a tragedy in the Mournes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not believe it useful this afternoon to
                try to apportion blame. The fundamental reason for the problem
                is that a deadly bug was found in our water supply,
                necessitating action and the sooner we find some way of getting
                money into the hands of farmers, the better. There is no doubt
                that if we do not find some way of compensating farmers,
                individual farmers in the Mournes will go to the wall because of
                this. That is how serious the situation is. The best solution is
                some form of subsidy adequate to enable the farmers to tick over
                until grazing is restored in 2004.</p>

                It is a pity that the proposer should have trivialised the
                motion so much. The Department for Regional Development is
                endangering the hill-side farmers of the Silent Valley and the
                Mourne Mountains, and those near to Belfast. The timescale for
                putting in place the safe scheme needed for the Silent Valley
                reservoir is totally inadequate. If the current situation
                continues for another three years it will put at risk the health
                of the people in Belfast and present a considerable burden to
                the hill farmers in the area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Gregory Campbell must move immediately and
                allocate farmers priority funding so that work on the filtering
                scheme can be brought forward. In view of present financial
                pressures, it is not enough to ask farmers to keep sheep off the
                grazing land. Farmers must be compensated for the alternative
                feed. The onus rests entirely on the Department for Regional
                Development and the Minister, Gregory Campbell, to end the risk
                to the people of Belfast and to alleviate the burden shouldered
                by farmers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What level of communication has been
                maintained between the Minister for Regional Development, who
                imposed the ban, the Minister of Agriculture, who is responsible
                for the farming industry, and the Minister of Health and Social
                Services, who is responsible for public safety? This is a key
                question. Or as many people suspect, is this an example of DUP
                sectarian antics putting people’s health and farmers’
                livelihoods at risk? It is time to stop playing party politics
                with people’s lives.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Agriculture Committee has also heard that
                there has been little discussion or negotiation between
                officials from the Department of Agriculture and Rural
                Development in the North and their counterparts in the South. In
                Donegal, where there are similar problems, the Southern
                Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has
                already said it will compensate the farmers for the duration of
                the problem. I have repeatedly called for a closer look to be
                taken at the ban affecting farmers in the Silent&nbsp;Valley,
                and for the scientific facts to be established on whether the
                cryptosporidium bug is linked to sheep specifically or to all
                grazing in general. Is the ban more appropriate on sheep grazing
                or is there flexibility to allow limited use of cattle for
                grazing in the Silent&nbsp;Valley to safeguard future area aid
                payments? The loss of income to farmers of area aid payments
                could be substantial because of a loss in acreage of the land
                available for grazing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would also seem to be short-sighted of the
                Department to allow the area to become overgrown with a
                subsequent deterioration in the physical beauty of an area which
                has been sustained by sheep grazing. The Environmental Heritage
                Service is also in the process of designating the area as an
                area of special scientific interest. Indeed, farmers are
                suspicious of the real agenda of those placing a lengthy ban on
                grazing in the area, given the future consequences for local
                farmers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accompanied a Sinn Féin delegation from
                south Down to meet Bríd Rodgers, and we put a strong case to
                her for the need to compensate farmers in the Silent Valley who
                are suffering directly from the ban on grazing. Since May
                farmers have been contacting Sinn Féin on a regular basis to
                express their anger at the lack of compensation. One hundred and
                fourteen farmers have been directly affected by the ban, and it
                is estimated that the farming community in the area will lose
                some £1&nbsp;million this year alone. While the Minister
                acknowledges that the Silent Valley farmers have been treated
                unfairly, she has also said that her hands are tied by Europe
                and by the Executive. It is now time for the Minister to act.
                Bríd&nbsp;Rodgers should go to the EU and the Executive and
                make a case for compensating the Silent&nbsp;Valley farmers. The
                lack of action by the Department of Agriculture and Rural
                Development and the Minister is threatening the continuing
                viability of sheep farming in the Mournes. No plan seems to be
                in place, and there is no will for decisive action. There is no
                guarantee of compensation and no end in sight for the grazing
                ban for the next three to four&nbsp;years. Farmers are asking:
                what is the alternative; how will we graze our sheep? Farmers
                are facing an increase in the price of land for grazing and no
                great profit in sheep because of poor prices at the farm gate.
                The farmers and the community are not getting the support they
                need from the Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Mr&nbsp;ONeill stated, an important aspect
                of this ban is that offspring of the sheep are losing the right
                to the grazing ground where they were reared. In other words,
                flocks of sheep are separated from their grazing ground year
                after year, and the offspring are being deprived of the plot of
                ground that belonged to them. Because of the ban, the offspring
                are deprived of that, and that causes a major problem for the
                farmers. Go raibh míle maith agat.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Bradley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion in the name of my
                Colleague Mr ONeill. He and the other Members have covered most
                of the problems that farmers are experiencing, through no fault
                of their own, at the Silent Valley.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the closure came about, both the farmers
                concerned and representatives from all political parties gave
                ample warnings on present and future problems. The difficult
                days ahead were spoken about last summer and in September. In
                just eight or 10 weeks the sheep and newborn lambs are due to
                return again to the Silent Valley slopes. The new lambs bring
                some continuity to the mountain’s grazing cycle. They
                familiarise themselves with the pastures grazed by earlier
                generations of the flock. If that cycle is allowed to be
                interrupted, it will present a problem that will never be
                resolved. To return sheep to former grazing pastures after a
                break of three or four years is not achievable and would only
                create bedlam as far as shepherding was concerned.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last week I asked the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister to put in place, through the Executive’s
                programme funds, a support mechanism to alleviate the short- and
                long-term problems imposed upon Mourne sheep farmers as a result
                of the Silent Valley grazing ban. We have heard different people
                blaming others, but the ban came about as a result of a demand
                from the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety.
                That was done for health reasons, and nobody can challenge that.
                The Minister for Regional Development, being the landlord, had
                to implement it. Subsequently, everybody came knocking on Bríd
                Rodgers’s door as Minister of Agriculture and Rural
                Development. Many other doors could have been knocked on. The
                Executive’s programme funds might have been the appropriate
                place to look for funding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In their answers, the Ministers stated that
                they understood that the Minister of Agriculture and Rural
                Development had met with a number of deputations on the issue
                and had obtained additional information for the affected
                farmers. The Minister stated that she is considering the
                position in the light of those contacts, with a view to reaching
                a decision on the way forward and</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;including the appropriateness of
                offering assistance.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regardless of which Department foots the
                bill, this is something that those of us who campaign on the
                farmers’ behalf are waiting to hear about.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our anxiety is minor compared to the concerns
                of farmers who await the lifeline that could save their flocks,
                which for many would protect a major percentage of their income.
                I missed the earlier part of the debate, but I would have liked
                all Ministers to be available to respond. I know there is a
                ruling on that, but with so many different Departments having
                responsibility it would only have been right for each Minister
                to be able to be here. In the future we will have to look at
                similar situations for which three Departments must carry the
                can.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate Mr ONeill for putting the
                motion on the Order Paper. At that point my congratulations run
                out, when I consider his contribution to the debate. That was
                unfortunate, given the excellent speeches made by Mr Bradley and
                Mr Wells, who between them brought an element of reason and
                sanity to a difficult issue — one that concerns farmers, the
                community and the livelihoods of many individuals in the Mournes
                area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill did nothing to convince my party to
                support the motion, which is unfortunate. His speech tended to
                borrow from that little verse in the Bible</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;All we like sheep have gone
                astray&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He seemed to stray everywhere with his
                statements. He strayed with the sheep on their traditional
                route, and he strayed with the sheep off their traditional
                route. That is unfortunate because he failed to make a number of
                key points and address a number of key issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He came to the Assembly armed with an
                allegation — an allegation made previously — that the
                Minister for Regional Development had misled the House. He had
                to temper that allegation with an admission during the course of
                this debate that the Minister for Regional Development had not
                misled the House. The only thing missing from his speech was an
                apology to the Minister. He should have retracted his allegation
                and accepted the ruling by the Speaker a little more graciously
                than he did.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The spurious point of order at the start of
                the debate and the ruling by the Speaker betrayed the fact that,
                if Mr ONeill himself does not know who is responsible — and if
                the Speaker cannot make a ruling on who is responsible — it
                ill behoves him to come to this House to try to pour blame on
                the Minister for Regional Development on a matter that Mr ONeill
                cannot even say that the Minister is fully responsible for. I
                hope that after the contribution by the Minister — who has had
                the decency to be here today — Mr ONeill will be prepared to
                thank him for his contribution and comments, which I hope will
                be constructive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This motion derives from a faux pas — an
                attempt by Mr ONeill to settle some old scores with the
                Department for Regional Development. That Department took a
                quick and necessary decision to protect human and public health.
                Those are not my words. They are the words of Mr P J Bradley in
                this debate, and he is absolutely right. The decision was taken
                on advice received from the Department of Health, Social
                Services and Public Safety. The Minister, and his predecessor,
                could do nothing else in that regard.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, through this motion, and
                during the course of this saga, the SDLP has attempted to ignore
                the public health issues by claiming that consultation between
                the Department for Regional Development and the Department of
                Agriculture and Rural Development was not as extensive as it
                might have been. The facts on consultation are very clear. The
                permanent secretary of the Department of Agriculture and Rural
                Development has agreed in writing — in a letter to myself that
                has been published — that there was consultation. We might not
                like the decision or the outcome, but the reality is that there
                was consultation. The SDLP once bitten was not twice shy when it
                should have been. It then attempted to squeeze compensation from
                the Minister for Regional Development, who clearly does not bear
                sole responsibility for the issue of compensation. The Minister
                of Agriculture and Rural Development should recognise that she
                should try to find a mechanism in her own Department to help her
                pick up the tab on this particular issue — and it will be an
                expensive issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We could continue in this way, playing silly
                games. My party could blame the SDLP Minister, as,
                unfortunately, the SDLP, through Mr ONeill in this debate, has
                tried quite deliberately to blame a DUP Minister. That would be
                unfortunate, not because of the cheap political point scoring,
                but for the farmers in the Mournes trying to graze their sheep
                and maintain a livelihood for themselves and their families. I
                do not, and will not, go down that road. It is important for
                people to keep their heads in relation to this issue. They must
                realise that they cannot come into the Chamber, blame the
                Minister and think that resolves the issue. They have to go one
                step further and try to find a process or mechanism to resolve
                the problem and get agriculture in that part of the Member’s
                constituency out of the doldrums it is in.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have had a number of suggestions in the
                House today. Mr Wells made an eminently sensible suggestion
                about the application forms for farming grants. The integrated
                administration control system (IACS) forms could be brought
                forward and additions made to them. That is a reasonable
                measure. The Agriculture Committee, which I sit on, has made
                that suggestion to the Department.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M Murphy, with his Victor Meldrew
                impersonation, made the suggestion, which was not that bright,
                that we should look to Donegal for the answer. Frankly, &quot;I
                don’t believe it.&quot; I do not believe that that is where
                the answer lies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Bradley actually came up with quite a good
                idea; that the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development
                should ask for the Executive’s programme funds to be used. I
                would go one step further and suggest that there should be a
                joint approach by the Minister for Regional Development and the
                Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development for Executive
                programme funding on this issue, because that is where the issue
                rests.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister, or Ministers, responsible have
                to find a mechanism with which to trigger compensation. I trust
                that officials — certainly those in the Department for
                Regional Development — will soon find a legal method that will
                go some way towards allowing them to trigger that mechanism for
                compensation. Ultimately, when we get away from all the politics
                involved, that is really the solution — to achieve
                compensation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is another issue for the House to
                consider. With all the shouting, berating and hectoring of
                Ministers for their different political allegiances, it is
                important that, when we come to consider the Budget in a few
                weeks’ time, the Minister for Regional Development is
                allocated the resources necessary to upgrade the water treatment
                works. I hope the SDLP and all parties argue equally strongly
                for that. That will ensure that any issue to do with sheep
                grazing on the Mournes can be resolved more speedily.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the public health issues, which
                have brought this matter on to the agenda, will also be
                resolved.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister for Regional Development (Mr
                Campbell):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr ONeill for the opportunity to
                participate in the debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I recognise the importance of the
                issue for the farming community in south Down. However, it is
                one that has even greater importance for the public health of
                the wider community. Therefore, I welcome the opportunity to
                place the issues in their proper and wider context.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Information about cryptosporidium and its
                effects are in the public domain. I made Members aware of that
                in my statement of 11 September 2000 on the outbreak of
                cryptosporidiosis in the Lisburn and south-west Belfast areas.
                However, given the importance of the subject, I would like to
                reiterate briefly the nature of cryptosporidium, the
                cryptosporidium risk assessment at Silent Valley, the reason for
                the exclusion of sheep from catchment lands, and how I see the
                compensation issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Crytposporidium is a parasitic organism,
                which can be water-borne, and which is resistant to normal
                disinfection processes. It can cause acute diarrhoeal illness,
                lasting two to three weeks. For those whose immune systems are
                weakened or compromised, it can be much more serious. Some
                Members have spoken about how serious it can be. In some
                instances, it can be fatal, as Mr Wells indicated. The organism
                can be removed by treatment incorporating fine infiltration, but
                once detected in the water distribution system, it can only be
                destroyed by boiling the water. There is a proven risk of
                cryptosporidium contamination of the public water supply from
                livestock grazing in reservoir catchment areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will now move on to the risk assessment at
                the Silent Valley. Following outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis in
                Great Britain, the Government appointed an expert group, under
                the chairmanship of Prof Ian Bouchier, to advise on measures to
                protect the public against cryptosporidium in drinking water.
                The group reported in 1998 and made over 50 recommendations, all
                of which were adopted by Water Service. One of the
                recommendations was that water utilities should carry out risk
                assessments on all their water catchment areas. Early in 1999,
                the Water Service assessed the risk of cryptosporidium
                contamination at all 59 of its sources. The assessment used was
                based on models used in England, Wales and Scotland, and
                developed in consultation with the Northern Ireland Drinking
                Water Inspector. The assessment showed that the Silent Valley
                was particularly at risk due to the lack of a satisfactory level
                of treatment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Silent Valley’s water supply serves a
                substantial part of County Down and south and east Belfast,
                amounting to approximately 250,000 people in total. Water
                treatment at the Silent Valley is confined to coarse filtration,
                pH adjustment and disinfecting. These are not effective in the
                removal or destruction of cryptosporidium oocysts. The catchment
                lands at the Silent Valley comprise 9,000 acres owned by the
                Department for Regional Development in the upper reaches of the
                Mourne Mountains. Against this background, sheep were excluded
                on a temporary basis from March of last year. A further review
                of the management of the Silent Valley catchment area confirmed
                the need to continue to exclude sheep. I announced that on 6
                September.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The ban has the support of the Chief Medical
                Officer and the Northern Ireland Drinking Water Inspector. I
                will review the position when the two new water treatment works
                for the Silent Valley and other reservoirs are provided. The new
                works, which will provide a barrier to prevent cryptosporidium
                from entering the distribution system, are programmed for
                completion in 2004 at a combined cost of £48m. The Mourne
                conduit, which carries water from the Silent Valley to Belfast,
                is currently being replaced at a cost of £32m.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a time lag between the approval of
                the replacement of the Mourne conduit and its completion. It is
                not physically possible for the works to be completed and
                operational before 2004. If it were possible, I would ensure
                that it was done. It is physically impossible. In addition, my
                Department has spent £250,000 on repairs to the Mourne wall to
                ensure that sheep cannot gain access to the catchment area.
                Contractors employed by the Mourne Heritage Trust carried out
                the work. Those significant investments demonstrate my
                Department’s commitment to ensuring that customers receive
                drinking water of the highest quality.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I regret that I had to take the decision to
                exclude sheep from the catchment lands, but in the interests of
                public health it was, and is, unavoidable. To repeat the
                comments that I made in a previous debate, what if there had
                been a risk to the drinking water supply of a quarter of a
                million of people and I had done nothing, or had delayed by a
                month, a week, or a day? Public representatives inside and
                outside this House would demand to know why did I not act to put
                the health of a quarter of a million people above every other
                consideration relating to the public drinking water supply. I
                repeat that I regret that I had to take the decision to exclude
                the sheep, but in the interests of public health, it was, and
                is, unavoidable. Protecting the public water supply must be my
                paramount consideration.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I met some of the farmers just over a week
                ago and heard their concerns at first hand, a fact mentioned by
                Mr Wells and Mr ONeill. I appreciate the difficulties that the
                ban has caused for local farmers, and I sympathise with their
                position. I am minded to give whatever assistance my Department
                can. However, I cannot go outside the legal constraints on my
                Department’s actions. By tradition, the right to use grazing
                land in Silent Valley has been renewed annually. The contract
                confers access to the facility of grazing, not possession of the
                grazing land itself. The legal advice is that as the practice of
                making grazing land available was on an annual basis, it can be
                discontinued.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recognise the local farmers’ concerns,
                but, regrettably, it will not be possible for my Department to
                pay compensation. I know that that will be a disappointment to
                the farmers, but I must have regard to the legal position. I
                will, however, give careful consideration to any of the
                suggestions made today that I can discuss with my Colleague the
                Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development. I am also willing
                to consider any scientific evidence that demonstrates
                conclusively that the presence of sheep would not present any
                risk to the public water supply. However, current advice from
                leading experts such as Prof Bouchier’s committee on
                cryptosporidium is that livestock grazing on catchment land is a
                risk to public health.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My officials have maintained close contact
                with officials from the Department of Agriculture and Rural
                Development to establish what measures could be taken to assist
                the farmers. Discussions are continuing on whether any of the
                suggestions — written and verbal — that have been made to my
                Department could provide a way forward.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During last week’s meeting between the
                Minister, his officials and a delegation of sheep farmers,
                several suggestions were put to him about a form of words that
                could crack the problem. Is the Minister’s Department
                considering those suggestions to see whether any of them offer a
                solution?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Campbell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can confirm, as I had just said before Mr
                Well’s intervention, that we are considering several
                representations, including some of those that were made by the
                delegation that the Member led to see me last week. We are also
                examining other options. I am conscious of what can happen as a
                result of comments made in the House and how misleading
                impressions can be created, but I should say that none of the
                suggestions made so far provides an automatic response to the
                difficulties that we face. They all present difficulties, and
                none of them provides the categorical and definitive response
                that the farmers would like.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have spoken to the Minister of Agriculture
                and Rural Development today, and I want to clarify a point that
                Mr ONeill raised at the outset. The Minister of Agriculture and
                Rural Development has asked that I make it clear that she wanted
                to respond to the motion jointly with me but was prevented from
                doing so by the Assembly’s procedures. She asked me to convey
                her concern about the plight of the farmers affected by the ban.
                She has also had meetings with deputations from different
                parties about the situation and has obtained additional
                information directly from the farmers themselves. Both of us
                assure the Assembly that we are keen to work together, through
                and with our Departments, to examine if there is any practical
                way of reducing the impact on the local farmers. To progress the
                issue we have agreed to meet soon, and a mutually convenient
                time will be arranged by our private offices.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Silent Valley catchment lands can not be
                made available for grazing because of the proven risk to public
                health. That action has the support of the medical authorities
                and the Drinking Water Inspector. As I said earlier, no one in
                the House would expect me to do otherwise. My first
                responsibility is the protection of the public water supply to
                the 250,000 customers who use the water from the Silent Valley.
                That does not mean that I am unsympathetic to the plight of
                farmers. I have demonstrated that I am sympathetic, and I am
                working with my Colleague in the Department of Agriculture and
                Rural Development to try to arrive at a conclusion to their
                plight. However, it would be irresponsible to allow grazing
                until the new treatment works are built. They will provide an
                effective barrier to cryptosporidium entering the water
                distribution system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sympathetic to the difficulties of the
                local farmers, but, on legal advice, I cannot justify payment of
                compensation. However, officials from the Department for
                Regional Development and the Department of Agriculture and Rural
                Development will continue to explore what other steps can be
                taken to assist those farmers affected. I will be meeting with
                the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development soon to
                discuss those issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to refute — and I hope that I have
                done so in my remarks — any suggestions of partisanship or
                sectarianism in the manner in which my Department and I have
                dealt with this issue. Some of the comments by a few Members
                mean that I am determined to try to reach a resolution of the
                problem despite their comments rather than because of them, and
                I will endeavour to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank all the Members who contributed to
                the debate. Alan&nbsp;McFarland emphasised the threat of
                cryptosporidium and stated that the outbreak in April and
                May&nbsp;2000, contrary to the other outbreak, was traced to an
                animal source. There are two traceable sources for the bug. One
                is human, and the other can be animal or human. This one was
                indeterminate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am basing that on the report of the
                investigation that was carried out by the Department of Health,
                Social Services and Public Safety into the outbreak during April
                and May&nbsp;2000. I pressed for the publication of that report,
                and the Health Minister promised that it would be published in
                the middle of August. However, it was almost December before we
                received it. I was greatly concerned that the publication of the
                report took so long, but the Health Minister did facilitate a
                meeting with myself and the medical team that was preparing the
                report, and I went through it in some depth with them. There is
                no evidence to suggest that the outbreak of cryptosporidium in
                April and May&nbsp;2000 originated from the Silent Valley sheep.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People try to construct things about the
                issue, and that is why I feel aggrieved. Not surprisingly, I
                feel angry when I hear from my constituents that things that
                could have been done to help them were not done due to various
                circumstances. It makes it even more pointed when the source of
                the infection did not come from where it was supposed to have
                come from. I would like to divest people of the argument about
                health slightly in order to take a look at the point about the
                source of infection. Of course, everyone’s first concern is
                for the public health of our community. However, some sort of
                understanding should be expressed when it is shown that a
                particular source is not the cause of infection. That evidence
                is available in this case.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jim&nbsp;Wells made several comments and, of
                course he used the occasion to attack me for attacking the
                Minister. It is a good old ruse, and I can well understand why
                he did not want to indulge in apportioning blame because he
                wants to protect his Colleague and Friend. That is fine. We all
                understand that, and we will not get excited about it. However,
                he quoted a statistic about the levels of infection and the
                number of oocysts per quantity. The public health report stated</p>

                and cryptosporidium was detected in the water supply between 26<sup>th</sup>
                April and 1<sup>st</sup> May, the maximum level detected of 0.1
                oocysts per 10L was below the recommended level for action of

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In other words, the number was considerably
                below the action level, yet action was taken. That is a

                him. However, we met the deputy chief executive of the Water

                do not want to minimise that in any way. On a person to person

                to hear a report on the radio this morning about the suggestion
                that sheep had been allowed into the area. It struck me as
                particularly interesting that someone should focus on this story
                after all this time. I detected that they wanted to divert
                attention away from the argument. On several occasions I have
                detected as much when I tried to investigate parts of the issue.
                It makes one feel that there is something of a plot afoot to
                disturb the public interest and to deflect public interest away
                from the issue. I may just be feeling a bit sore and persecuted
                but I have had that suspicion on several occasions. I wonder if
                it has anything to do with certain officials in a certain
                Department being conscious of the fact that they should have
                carried out tests on the safety, efficiency and protection of
                the water supply.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is in the public interest for Members to
                bear this in mind. We are all aware of the extent to which we
                were dominated, in the past, by the Civil Service — there was
                no proper accountability. I definitely get the impression that
                this case was treated in such a way. Public health was
                constantly used to divert my attention away from protecting
                farmers. They were made the scapegoats at all times, even though
                the evidence indicates that the opposite is the case. This is
                what emerged from my dealings with the three Ministers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Paisley&nbsp;Jnr claimed that I
                failed to make a number of key points. I waited patiently for
                these points to be made, but I did not hear them. He was
                inclined to try to direct some form of calumny at me and to
                trivialise my comments, without realising that I am trying to
                reflect the very serious and sincere anger of the people I
                represent. I may perhaps be forgiven for my actions. I hope that
                I am forgiven, because I have seen the effects of this
                situation, and I get cross and upset when I can see ways around
                bureaucratic decisions that are not being taken.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s expressed
                willingness to try to solve the problem. I still maintain that
                his Department has a key role to play in this matter, and I hope
                that that will encourage him and his officials to do everything
                possible, in conjunction with his Colleagues. Interestingly,
                this debate might just result in greater co-operation between
                our ministerial Colleagues in the Chamber — there have been
                some examples of this today, and I am glad to see that
                happening.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I appeal to the Minister to consider
                seriously my request that the pasturage link be maintained.
                Experts say that the risk of a cryptosporidium outbreak is least
                hazardous in August, September and October, and there is no
                evidence that anything happens at those times. Even if the rest
                of my argument falls on deaf ears, I urge the Minister to
                consider allowing those months to be used to establish and
                maintain that pasturage link, which would allow the tradition to
                continue after the Department carries out the intended work.</p>

                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That this Assembly calls on the Minister of
                Education to publish information which enables the performance
                of schools in Northern Ireland to be adequately measured and
                compared.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will outline why I felt this issue should
                be debated by the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, we have a decision that has caused
                widespread concern, and I am going to mention some of the people
                who have expressed concern in a moment. Secondly, we have an
                issue that once again illustrates the cavalier manner with which
                the Minister of Education handles his portfolio. It does no
                credit to the Assembly, to its Committees, or to the general
                education debate for such an important issue, which is central
                to the whole delivery of education in Northern Ireland, to have
                been delivered in this particular way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is an important issue. The Department of
                Education receives the second-highest amount of money from the
                Budget for Northern Ireland, and a high proportion of that goes
                directly to schools. Therefore, it is important to have some
                measure on how effectively that money is being spent. One way of
                doing that is to measure the output of schools. The Minister, in
                his wisdom, has decided to do away with the only measure of
                performance that is made available to the public so that they
                can judge whether or not schools are delivering. It is a
                decision that has drawn criticism from academics, including Prof
                Tony Gallagher; from industrialists, including the Institute of
                Directors; and from parents and some school principals. It is a
                decision that ironically — or perhaps not ironically, but
                predictably — has been welcomed by teachers’ unions. Some
                may well say that the Minister, having failed to make friends
                anywhere else in education, has decided to zone in on the
                teachers’ unions: better some friends than no friends. But if
                he is doing that at the expense of the accountability of the
                education budget and what goes on in schools, then the Assembly
                ought to be concerned.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second reason for my bringing the matter
                to the Assembly is that the Minister has handled this issue in
                an unacceptable manner. This is a major policy change, and it
                makes Northern Ireland different from all other parts of the
                United Kingdom, but, as we found out yesterday, the matter was
                not brought before the Executive. Other Executive Members were
                not consulted about it. So much for what we have been told about
                the Executive’s ability to rein in rogue Ministers. The
                decision is contrary to the views expressed by the Education
                Committee. I know that some people will find it rather odd that
                another member of the Education Committee has put down an
                amendment welcoming the decision. But let me remind the Assembly
                what the Education Committee said to the Minister on this issue:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Committee believes that it is
                important that performance information on schools is made widely
                available to assist openness, transparency and…&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">— this is important —</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;for the benefit of making
                comparisons.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That was endorsed unanimously by the
                Education Committee, including the member who is going to move
                an amendment to the motion in a moment or two.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee went on:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Committee accepts that the
                provision of comparative information can assist schools to
                monitor and evaluate their performance and set targets to
                improve.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It concluded that:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Department should regularly publish
                comparative information...&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first preference was that the comparison
                should be based on value-added information. But in the interim,
                until the Department decided what information to include, the
                Committee said that the Department should continue to publish
                the information as at present, but make it a bit more meaningful
                by benchmarking. In other words, rather than having one league
                table in which all schools were treated the same, divide it into
                divisions, similar to the football league, which would make it a
                bit fairer. Premier league schools should not be compared with
                fourth division schools. That may be an inadequate analogy, but
                it nevertheless demonstrates that schools divide into different
                sections, either because of their intake, their area, or the
                nature of the youngsters who go there.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister ignored the views of the
                Committee. He ignored the views of many professionals, and he
                ignored the Executive. That is why it is important for the
                Assembly to debate this issue. The Minister now seems to be
                making decisions on the basis of some kind of inadequate and
                partial referendum. He sought to justify his decision by stating
                that 75% of the responses he received were in support of doing
                away with tables published by the Department. What he failed to
                say was that of the three options, two involved the publication
                of the kind of information that is currently available. One
                option was for it to be produced by boards, the other for it to
                be published by the Department. The division between those
                preferring that it be done purely by schools and those wanting
                some other central body to do it was almost fifty-fifty.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was never indicated that the decision
                would be made on a headcount. Is the Minister going to handle
                these important issues simply by getting the responses and
                totalling them all up? Regardless of the nature, quality,
                standing and source of the responses, will he take 51% and say
                that if those people are in favour, then that is the route to
                take? For a party that has railed against majority rule, that is
                a very odd way to behave.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is that how he is going to deal with the
                review of post-primary education? If it is, the message is that
                every Tom, Dick and Harry across the country should write in.
                That is how the Minister is going to decide — by some form of
                postal referendum. In light of Sinn Féin’s reputation on
                postal votes, one has to query the wisdom of allowing things to
                be decided in that way. That is why this issue needed to be
                debated. It is significant that the majority of responses from
                parents said that they wished to have information reported by
                either the Department or the boards. Even though there has been
                a concerted campaign by teaching unions, 44% of teachers said
                that they did not mind such information being published by
                either the Department or the boards. There is no great
                resistance to performance information, presented in a
                comparative way, being published, however much the Minister
                likes to suggest that his decision was backed up by popular
                demand.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us look at some of the arguments. First
                of all, the Department’s own consultation document recognises
                the value of these tables. Here are some examples:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Tables encourage competition among
                schools, and the effect of competition is often to drive up
                standards. Many schools have worked hard in recent years to
                develop strategies that will improve their ‘ranking’ in the
                Tables … the Tables can provide a basis for discussion about
                comparative performance, standards and quality of teaching
                between staff and Governors.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The document points out that the information
                is popular. Over the past seven years, more than 250,000 copies
                of the school league tables have been distributed. No complaint
                has ever been received from a parent about receiving unwanted
                material. I could go on. The Department’s document indicates
                that there is value in the tables. The Minister, under section
                4.2 of the Programme for Government, indicates that one of the
                prime reasons for demanding more money for education is to
                improve the standard of education. We have a situation where we
                have the Department admitting that a particular way of improving
                standards in schools is to publish information, the Minister
                saying he wants to do that, and yet he no longer publishes the
                figures.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department is now setting out targets for
                GCSE and Key Stage 2 attainment. If the Department is happy to
                set those targets nationally, why should we not look at the
                component parts of how those national targets are achieved? If
                some schools are underachieving, let it be known, so that, as
                the Committee said, they can be monitored and helped. Despite
                the compelling evidence from the Department, and the fact that
                the Department is now saying that targets will be set for GCSE
                and A level passes, Key Stage 2 attainment and everything else,
                those tables are not going to be published.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One reason might be that the Minister is
                seeking to bring Northern Ireland into line with the Irish
                Republic, which is one of the few countries in the world that
                has bowed to the pressure of professionals within the education
                establishment. Not only does it refuse to publish the
                information, it bans publication by anybody else. What is the
                result? We hear a lot about the Celtic tiger, and how education
                has driven that, but the results are far from that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third International Maths and Science
                Survey reported that, when it tested nine year-olds and thirteen
                year-olds in maths and science, the Republic of Ireland ranked
                in the lower half of the countries surveyed. Only Cyprus, Iran
                and Portugal were lower. An international adult literacy survey
                looked at prose document and numeric literacy. Of the six
                English-speaking countries in the Organisation for Economic
                Co-operation and Development (OECD), the standard in the Irish
                Republic was the lowest. It was also lowest in computer literacy
                in OECD English-speaking countries — just below half-way in
                the ranking of Western Europe. A whole range of statistical
                information shows that if standards are not measured publicly,
                it does not matter how much money is spent on education. There
                will be a lack of value for money.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many arguments have been put forward against
                publishing the league tables — some of them fairly spurious.
                The first is that it affects the morale of teachers. I would
                have thought that one way of improving teacher morale would be
                to show that what they were doing was valued and measured, and
                that when improvements took place there was something to praise
                them for. The attitude of some of the teachers’ unions
                contrasts greatly with that of teachers in other countries. The
                American Federation of Teachers actually called for the
                publication of standards. It said that it believed that it was
                important for students to know what they should be able to do at
                each grade level and to have examinations administered by the
                state, and that that in turn would create confidence in the
                schools.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will finish now.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second argument is that the publication
                of league tables distorts the activity of schools. I would have
                thought that the main reason why parents send their youngsters
                to school was to gain qualifications. Therefore, one needs to
                measure whether schools have achieved that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sure that Ms Lewsley will deal with the
                third argument, which is that schools do more than just pump out
                examination candidates. That is quite true. However, parents,
                when they are choosing schools, do not look solely at league
                tables or performance tables. They will go to open nights and
                listen to what their children and other children say, what
                people who have gone through the school say, and what they read
                in the newspapers about a school. All that information is
                factored in anyway. That does not do away with the need to have
                some measure of school performance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, here is a quote from a letter sent
                to a local newspaper by a parent, referring to how some west
                Belfast schools had underperformed:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The public has a right to know if
                schools have underperformed, and pupils have a right to have it
                redressed.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The only way one can know if schools have
                underperformed is if one has comparative information published.
                The only way one can have it redressed is to have schools
                monitored. For those schools which are underachieving, that
                information should be used as a means of devoting help,
                attention and resources so that children get what parents expect
                for them when it comes to the school system.</p>

                all after &quot;Assembly&quot; and add</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;welcomes the decision of the Minister
                not to continue the current publication of school performance
                tables and calls on the Minister of Education to ensure that
                information supplied to parents about schools is wide-ranging
                and detailed and includes social and economic background data,
                extra-curricular and non-academic classes offered and other ‘value-added’
                information.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is schools that should deliver performance
                tables, not the Department. As Mr Wilson said, we are not asking
                for performance measures to be taken away, but we are asking
                that the schools deliver them and not the Department.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As many of us know, last October the
                Department initiated a consultation on the future of school
                performance tables and invited responses from schools, parents
                and other interested groups on the issue. At that time, I was
                concerned that the consultation period was too short. Responses
                had to be returned to the Department by 8 December. I was also
                concerned that the options were too limited. Mr Wilson has
                already mentioned the three options. In response to that
                consultation, many people who responded at that time, including
                my own party, chose option two. The proviso was that it should
                be implemented with appropriate monitoring by the Department,
                particularly given the additional resources saved through
                ceasing to publish the tables. Under option two we believed that
                schools would be required to provide parents with a copy of
                their prospectus, with the details of their examination
                performance set in the context of other information about that
                school.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I believe that it is in the interests of
                equality of opportunity and social inclusion for all children
                that adequate information on schools is presented to parents to
                ensure informed choice. Education is a vital element in society,
                coming close in importance to food and shelter. Not only that,
                it is a human right. To provide parents with full and accurate
                information on schools, we need to recognise the need for a more
                holistic approach to the achievement of schools. I believe that
                there should be a duty on schools to present examination data,
                with vocational qualifications alongside academic
                qualifications. It is important that information on the
                achievements and extra-curricular and non-academic activities of
                the schools, including what I would term the value added by the
                socioeconomic background of the students and areas, be given.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not accept that it is impossible to
                devise a system for presenting the information on the value
                added by a school, given its particular circumstances and
                approach. All too often, emphasis is placed on the school’s
                academic performance alone, and this can increase the burden on
                the school to meet targets and to satisfy league tables, with
                the result that it becomes league-driven and geared too much
                towards academia. We have to move away from perpetual testing to
                perpetual teaching. This type of limited information can also be
                misleading for parents when choosing a suitable school for their
                child’s needs. What we should have, as I have said before, is
                equality of opportunity. We must tackle the issues of
                underachievement, rural schools, nursery education and, in
                particular, special needs education. We must ensure that we
                target social need and take into account a child’s abilities
                and reflect a child’s needs and parental choice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to develop a second level education
                that gives equal weight to a vocational stream operating
                alongside an academic stream to develop a real and meaningful
                curriculum that meets the needs of pupils and society. In my
                opinion, although we have a high level of excellence, we also
                have a high level of underachievement that needs to be tackled.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a parent of a child who got her results on
                Saturday morning, I can assure Members that only about 30% of
                parents will be worried about league tables. The others, of whom
                I am one, are only worried at this stage about what school their
                children will actually get into. For me the issue is not about
                league tables. It is about finding a school that can give my
                child encouragement and the equality of opportunity to fulfil
                her potential, whether by a vocational or an academic route.
                Given the right environment, I believe that she will have the
                chance to regain some of the self-esteem and motivation that she
                lost on Saturday at the tender age of 10. I also believe that
                our aim should be to encourage all our children to develop their
                full potential in relation to academic, sporting, vocational,
                musical, artistic or other abilities, and to cope with whatever
                limitations or difficulties they may have or encounter. I ask
                the Assembly to support this amendment.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Kennedy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the opportunity to participate in
                this important debate. I am speaking as the Ulster Unionist
                Party’s spokesperson on education, but I will also be saying a
                little in my role as the Chairman of the Education Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The whole issue of school performance tables
                has, from time to time, been shrouded in controversy. It is
                clear that there are conflicting views in the education sector
                as to their value. I am unable to give my support to the
                amendment tabled by the Member for Lagan Valley, Mrs&nbsp;Lewsley.
                In the submissions that were made to the Minister — and
                particularly those of the Ulster Unionist Party and the
                Education Committee — and the Minister’s subsequent
                decision, there are gaps that I, as spokesperson on education
                and Chairperson of the Education Committee, am concerned about.
                The gaps relate, for the large part, to the main text outlined
                in Ms Lewsley’s amendment. I am unwilling to commit myself to
                that amendment, in the light of the absence of a ministerial
                commitment to take action and support the proposals contained in
                the second part of the amendment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ulster Unionist Party expressed its view
                to the Minister, as part of the consultation process, that there
                is a clear need for this type of information to be made
                available to those involved in education, including pupils,
                parents, teachers, library boards and the Department of
                Education. This would provide these groups with access to data,
                which would enable them to make better-informed decisions,
                albeit from a statistical perspective. School performance tables
                did not take account of everything that schools provide. For
                that reason, we were convinced that value-added information
                should be made available alongside the pure statistical data.
                Every effort should, therefore, be made to chart a school’s
                complete performance on both an academic and a personal level.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ulster Unionist Party, in its submission
                on school performance tables to the Minister, also emphasised
                the need for his Department to consider the assistance and input
                of the Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment (CCEA),
                which has undertaken a wide range of useful work in this area.
                At the time of the ministerial announcement, that element was
                absent. I will be interested to hear his views on this
                value-added information and on the role that the CCEA might play
                in that respect.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Education Committee’s response was that
                it is very important that performance information on schools be
                made widely available and readily accessible to all stakeholders
                to promote openness and transparency and to enable comparisons
                to be made. That information must be accurate, consistent and
                easy to understand. In consideration of these issues, the
                Committee recognised that one of the benefits of the publication
                of school performance tables was the provision of accurate and
                consistent information that enables comparisons to be made. This
                comparative information could assist schools to monitor and
                evaluate their performances and to set their targets for
                improvement. However, the Education Committee also recognised
                that the old format of performance tables provided information
                on a limited range of examination results. It was felt that the
                tables might reinforce the view that academic attainment alone
                is of value and that the comparison of schools on the basis of
                examination results is misleading in the absence of a reliable
                method of assessing and reporting value-added information.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For these reasons, I believe, the Education
                Committee made two recommendations regarding the review of the
                school performance tables. The first recommendation was that
                each school be provided with a simple standardised package of
                information on how to enhance the range of non-examinable
                subject options and other aspects of school life which are on
                offer, with a view to their publication in its prospectus. In
                essence, that is now being implemented. This is my understanding
                of the response, but the Minister will want to confirm that.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second recommendation of the Education
                Committee was that the Department should regularly publish
                meaningful and comparative information based on value-added
                performance indicators. This information would measure the
                progress achieved by students during a phase of education
                relative to their different starting points or the value-added
                education that a school offers. This would allow a more accurate
                assessment and comparison of schools. While the Committee is
                aware that as yet there is no easily understandable way in which
                to measure this, the Department of Education and the Minister
                should pursue this as a matter of urgency. A central provision
                of information would emphasise and heighten awareness of the
                importance of raising and maintaining standards. However, the
                information provided must be transparent, simple to understand
                and interpret and allow a comparison of like with like. That is
                why I am happy to give my support to the proposal outlined by Mr
                S Wilson. While I have great sympathy with and can identify very
                much with much of the text of the amendment proposed by Ms&nbsp;Lewsley,
                I am unable to give my full support to that this afternoon.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate my Colleague
                Mr&nbsp;S&nbsp;Wilson for getting this motion on the Order
                Paper, and indeed I support it. I want to contribute to the
                debate by reading an extract from an editorial in the ‘News
                Letter’ on Monday, January&nbsp;15 — I think that was the
                day after the Minister took the decision to scrap the existing
                league tables. It said</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Surely the answer is to provide more
                information, not less. The tables have fulfilled an important
                function by putting previously unreleased information into the
                public domain, in an easily accessible way.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That &quot;easily accessible&quot;
                information, which was heretofore not available, has now been
                removed. That is censorship. The Minister has made a quite
                deliberate attempt to deny parents access to information.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No one ever argued that this information was
                the be-all and the end-all; neither was it ever argued that this
                was the basis upon which to make a decision about a child’s
                future education — but was it? It was information to guide a
                parent and, indeed, to guide schools on the decisions that they
                had to make. It is unfortunate that less information is now
                available to parents when they come to make a crucial choice
                about the future of their child’s education. That was the most
                regrettable thing about the Minister’s decision, and it is
                that that has prompted this debate — we want to get a system
                of comparison in place. As the motion quite rightly states,
                information is published that allows for schools to be compared
                and allows us to make judgements against performance targets. In
                this day and age we are told to encourage the setting of targets
                and we are urged to reach and achieve them, so it seems very
                strange that the Minister of Education wants to deny us
                information which will let us know if schools are achieving the
                targets that have been set.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the ‘News Letter’ on January 15, the
                Minister outlined his reason — or his excuse — for deciding
                to scrap the publication of these important tables. He said</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;When I asked people what they would
                like me to do to improve the education system, one answer kept
                coming back. ‘Do something about the league tables’.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This was second only to ‘Do something about
                the 11-plus’.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That prompts the question: does the Minister
                do everything he is asked? Does he respond so favourably to
                every request that is made to him? Would he respond so
                favourably to similar requests to increase teachers’ pay? A
                quare lot of people across Northern Ireland clearly think that
                he has not responded to that one. Teachers’ pay has not been
                increased in the way in which they would like it to have been
                increased. No, the fact of the matter is that the Minister has
                fallen foul of the politically correct lobby on this issue.
                Instead of permitting parents to have access to all of the
                information they require, he has engaged in a form of
                censorship, and that is wrong.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion before the House will allow us to
                lift that censorship. Given the Minister’s party and his
                protest in the past about censorship, one would have hoped that
                he would be able to understand parental concerns about
                censorship. However, it was a forlorn hope for many in the House
                and across Northern Ireland that he would be prepared to listen
                and respond positively to requests by parents and people in the
                teaching profession who want to see this information’s being
                published. There is a truism that information is power. When you
                are denied information, you are denied the power to make
                appropriate decisions based on all the facts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the unfortunately named &quot;school
                league tables&quot; were first published, they gave parents a
                valuable measure by which to test schools. They blew apart the
                myth that grammar schools were miles ahead of other schools, and
                they put into perspective the criteria that academics placed on
                the exam achievement status of several schools. Indeed, the ‘News
                Letter’ editorial that I quoted from earlier made this very
                point. It said</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;In 1993, the ‘News Letter’
                highlighted the fact that in some areas, an extraordinarily high
                percentage of young males were leaving school to go on to
                Government training programmes, and a follow-up investigation
                revealed that in many cases, the programmes fulfilled no useful
                function. The result of this was that the Training and
                Employment Agency improved their schemes and their monitoring
                systems to the benefit of young school leavers.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This was achieved because of those school
                league tables. Under current departmental circumstances that
                could not be achieved. The Minister has denied people the
                information they need.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">School league tables were not, and were never
                intended to be, the be-all and end-all or the only measure of
                school achievement, but they were a useful source of
                information. The Minister has decided to throw the baby out with
                the bath water. A small number of teachers must be laughing up
                their sleeves at the Minister of Education today, because he has
                been putty in their hands and has done exactly as he was told.
                &quot;Get rid of the league tables; get rid of the guides; get
                rid of the measurements that, perhaps, point the finger of blame
                at some teachers, and tell them that they have to do their jobs
                in a better way.&quot;</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The tables also encourage schools to improve
                their activities and raise their standards to help young people
                achieve the examination results they are capable of achieving.
                Instead of destroying an existing process, the Minister ought to
                have improved on the league system. However, this Minister’s
                psyche does not allow him to build; it only allows him to
                destroy. This is a classic example of the destruction of
                information that should be made available to parents, teachers
                and the public so that people can make reasoned and rational
                decisions about the future of their children’s education and
                about where children should go for their secondary or grammar
                school education.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I
                should not really be welcoming the opportunity to have this
                debate, because it is quite unnecessary. League tables were
                discussed at length in the Education Committee, and the issue
                should have been sorted out there. We made decisions, and while
                some people say that we came to a different decision, I do not
                think we did. Some of us pointed out the problems with the
                system. I do not agree with Members who say that we should keep
                the league tables.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I now speak in support of the amendment. I
                always worry when something positive such as education is raised
                in the &quot;No&quot; politics of the DUP. I always worry that
                it is not for the benefit of everyone concerned. The tables
                themselves are a blunt instrument for measuring performance, and
                I am totally opposed to their publication. Making information
                available is one thing, but publicising it so that the media and
                everyone else can have a field day supporting a particular
                agenda is unfair to the parents and, especially, to the
                teachers, who are trying to educate children in very different
                conditions. The decision made was probably the right one.
                Teachers and parents seem to support it, and I am sure that
                children in schools higher up the tables do. It is all very well
                if you are at the top of the heap, able to look down on the rest
                and make assertions about how you are doing, but it is a totally
                unfair system for measuring children’s, teachers’ or schools’
                performance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would try to put something in place that is
                fair to everyone. I would not choose, at any time of the year,
                to compare schools with each other on an unfair basis. That only
                serves to show that certain schools, certain teachers and
                certain children are not performing at all, while others are
                doing exceedingly well. That has to be wrong, and it was on that
                basis that we made our decision. Whether decisions were made by
                individuals at the Committee or otherwise, that is how I made
                mine.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">League tables do not show the full picture.
                There they bear a likeness to the 11-plus examination. They
                measure only a few of schools’ many educational outcomes, such
                as the students with five or more A to C grades. In particular,
                they do not take into account personal growth, social skills and
                the creativity of children, or the wide variations in the
                socio-economic and educational needs of pupils. They do not
                compare different context and ability ranges — even in the
                secondary sector — a school’s extra-curricular activities,
                or its contribution to placing young people in jobs and
                supporting them in stressful circumstances.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Particular areas suffer social disadvantage.
                As many areas are deprived, children have to go to their local
                schools, and often they do not have a choice. League tables do
                not take into consideration the fact that there may not always
                be family support or money available to provide the support
                necessary to enable pupils to achieve the grades and standards
                that pupils at schools placed higher up the tables can. Social
                disadvantage, therefore, does come into the equation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Education should not be a race to the very
                top, as the press says. Every school has special needs, and
                there is also the matter of pastoral development. For
                Mr&nbsp;S&nbsp;Wilson to say that the Minister ignored our views
                is wrong. There is to be a review of the situation, which we
                have talked about, and I am sure that that will be ongoing. We
                also intend to consult now and in the future on the issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Media sensationalism is one of the areas from
                which the DUP motion is coming. Is Sammy&nbsp;Wilson trying to
                highlight the performance of elitist schools against the
                performance of the many who want to deliver education in an
                unequal educational environment, rather than for any great
                educational reasons? The press’s obsession with academic
                results does not necessarily help us obtain an educational
                system in which we can educate our young people for a modern
                world. My difficulty with league tables is that the media
                control — or try to control — agendas and come out with
                headlines that try to drive a particular agenda, and that is
                wrong.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am all for the sharing of information and
                for the sharing of a wider range of information. That is what is
                wrong with the present system. A limited amount of information
                was available to parents — information which they were able to
                read in the press the morning after the league tables were
                published. We need wider information. We need to inform parents
                so that they can make a choice. I am in favour of sharing
                information with parents who are interested in all the
                information. In the past, parents were not always interested in
                the detail and, in some cases, even in the headlines. Education
                is about more than parents comparing the top schools with those
                that their children must attend because there is no choice.
                There is a disparity in the abilities of children, and many
                schools need to be upgraded — for which they must wait for
                many years — before they can be compared with a nearby school.
                Many such things need to be taken into account.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister has made the right decision. It
                is popular with teachers and pupils, and they know best.
                Perhaps, the only people who think it better to keep the tables
                are those in the schools at the very top — the high-achieving
                academic schools. It is OK for them; they can turn in a great
                performance every year. They achieve such a high level of
                performance, because they get the cream of the crop. That is
                unfair to everyone else. The Minister’s decision was a good
                one, and the issue can be considered again in the future. I
                support the amendment.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs E Bell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is said that schooldays are the happiest
                days of one’s life. I never believed that, even in my
                relatively trouble-free school life. I certainly do not
                subscribe to it today, given the many assessments and
                examinations that today’s pupils have to endure in the three
                stages of their educational life. I welcome the Minister’s
                statement that school performance tables will not be published
                again.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Alliance Party feels that the tables,
                introduced in 1983, have a narrow focus on examination
                attainment only. They do not include information for parents and
                potential pupils about other vital factors — citizenship
                education, development of interactive living skills or
                facilities for children with special needs, for example. Full
                information on the overall situation in a school should be made
                available, and only the schools can do that. They are best
                placed to give details of academic achievements, pupil
                development and the range of projects that aid such development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Prior knowledge of the total picture would
                have a helpful effect on how parents view such schools. The
                annual league tables do not convey that information. They simply
                show examination performance: they are not called
                &quot;performance tables&quot; for nothing. Such information
                places additional pressure on pupils and teachers to achieve the
                optimum number of passes in each examination. The Alliance Party
                is concerned by an increasing body of anecdotal evidence that
                suggests that some schools, in an increasing attempt to secure
                the best possible profile in the league tables, are suggesting
                that pupils who are experiencing difficulties and have been
                judged by their teachers to be underperforming in examinations
                should move to other schools before entering for examinations.
                That should not be allowed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Good performance should not be the priority
                in education. Education should be centred on meeting the needs
                of all children, whatever their ability. The current mechanical
                approach is rarely to the advantage of the children concerned.
                In its submission, the Alliance Party said</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;People assume that what is measured is
                an indication of what is deemed to be valuable by the system.
                The league tables, which focus solely on academic attainment in
                examination, reinforce the idea that academic attainment alone
                is of any value.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A more diverse range of criteria must be
                introduced if equity of value and esteem is to be given to all
                aspects of educational achievement and endeavour. The
                publication of the academic achievement of schools must also be
                placed in context. This would be best achieved through the
                publication of results as one aspect of a school prospectus,
                which includes the full range of educational and
                extra-curricular experiences, opportunities and initiatives
                offered by each school, and which reflects all the facets of a
                school’s achievements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The publication of such documents should be
                compulsory for all schools and could form the basis of the
                transfer booklet currently distributed to parents. The results
                of this recent consultation process on league tables showed
                clearly that parents do not want the tables, whatever Mr S
                Wilson may have said. They speak of performance alone, and
                parents do not want that. Parents also wish to see included the
                ethos of the school establishment, added-value measurements such
                as the ability range of pupils, a range of criteria wide enough
                to reflect achievement across the various aspects of educational
                experience offered throughout the system, and the different
                emphasis placed by individual schools on meeting the needs of
                all their pupils.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the review of the information
                that a school is required to include in its prospectus will
                include all types of schools in different areas, and that its
                findings will go a long way toward assisting schools in drawing
                up their individual information packages. Obviously, this is
                where the Department of Education could come in with advice. The
                Minister of Education has made such a commitment, and a full
                review has been taking place. I hope that that is done
                expeditiously. Performance tables have been shown to be
                problematic in encouraging pupils to have unrealistic ambitions
                and parents to assume unrealistic ideas of the abilities of
                their children by sending them to schools with the best record
                of achievement but where less gifted pupils may feel unable to
                match up.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, I say that we should always
                have as our priority the establishment of a system that
                encourages and enables all children to achieve their own highest
                potential. The Alliance Party believes that the performance
                tables do not do this, and that the interests of parents,
                students and schools will be best served by the information’s
                being made available within individual school publications,
                where the school provides the information as part of the school
                prospectus. The motion suggests that the Minister of Education
                should publish the information for comparison and measurement.
                That would put us back to square one, where the wrong values of
                superiority, et cetera, would pertain. Therefore I cannot
                support it. I support the amendment, as it outlines a good basis
                for the elements necessary for the future of our children’s
                education.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is the first occasion that this Assembly
                will hear from Mr Hamilton when he will be making what can be
                described as a maiden speech. As Members know, it is the
                convention in another place that such a speech is made without
                interruption.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As this is my maiden speech, I promise to
                keep it short and to the point.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr S Wilson referred at the beginning of his
                speech to the need to evaluate how effectively money is spent on
                education. I do not believe that anyone in this House would
                disagree with that. Certainly Mr Wilson and I, who have both
                served in the teaching profession, would not disagree on that
                matter. I have no problem with the idea of schools publishing
                examination results. However, the information currently used and
                the format in which it is presented do not go far enough,
                because it in no way gives parents full or precise information
                as to exactly how a school performs. The tables, as used, were
                great if you taught in one of those schools that the top 30% of
                our pupils attend. The tables, as used, suited you as a teacher,
                because they reflected the high results that those types of
                pupils produced in examinations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is all very well for Mr S Wilson to refer
                to the damage that he claims is being done to teacher morale by
                not producing the league tables. I take issue with him on that
                point. He does not seem to have considered the undervaluation
                many teachers felt when they took a pupil, possibly with severe
                learning difficulties — as I did on several occasions — and
                managed to improve him or her sufficiently to achieve a GCSE
                grade F. The amount of work and effort that the teacher and the
                pupil put in — for what was a major achievement by the pupil
                — was not reflected at all in the published league tables.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Parents do not always just look at a school’s
                academic performance. They do not always look at how many grade
                As or Bs were achieved. The reason is that in the real world
                many parents have children with learning difficulties, and they
                do not look at the number of grade As and Bs when trying to find
                a school. They want to know what special classes and teaching
                methods will be used to help their children. They know that
                their children will probably never be able to aspire to grade As
                and Bs so when they look for schools to send their children to
                the published league tables provide them with no help and no
                guidance — nothing in that respect.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Lewsley’s amendment has much to
                recommend it, but for the reasons outlined by my Colleague Mr
                Kennedy we are unable to support it. I do not have to reiterate
                those reasons, because Mr Kennedy outlined them adequately. In
                conclusion, my only regret is that Ms Lewsley did not approach
                us with the idea of devising a joint amendment, because she
                would have found much common ground for her proposals with many
                in the House.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gibson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This motion is timely and essential. I am
                reacting to an outburst made by the Deputy First Minister, Mr
                Mallon, when he spoke at a formal occasion — the opening of a
                commercial event in east Belfast. On that occasion, he indicated
                that the education system was somehow failing the people of
                Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My private reaction was, first, that he might
                be correct. Secondly, I noted that the second-largest budget had
                been devoted to education — and quite rightly so — because
                the most prized asset that any community can have is its own
                educated people. That is the basic building block of society and
                all human activity. Therefore that is why it was essential that
                the so-called league tables were published. First, they did
                raise standards, and that is acknowledged in all the
                publications. The long tail of underperformance has been
                virtually eliminated by some of those schools, and children who
                did not feel that they should strive and struggle to achieve.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was encouragement; there was praise,
                and there was success. That removed the greater part of the long
                tail of underachievement. Therefore raising school standards
                embodies much more than the statement of facts. It is something
                that must be supported. Further evidence of this was put to us
                strongly just before the Minister made his statement. The
                Confederation of British Industry, the Chamber of Commerce and
                other industry interests told us &quot;League tables are not
                complete in themselves.&quot; Everyone in this Chamber would
                agree that league tables never provided an adequate amount of
                information. I think that we would all be agreed on that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is currently a pilot scheme running in
                England that is devising a method for adding on the value-added
                element. We are told that that will not be available until the
                2003-04 academic year. Rather than stopping the publication of
                the league tables, we should have kept on with them. We should
                have used our best endeavours to ensure that value-added
                measures will be appended to any future tables. When we met the
                Minister I made it very clear to him that we in Northern
                Ireland, at the periphery of Europe, cannot, in any way be seen
                to be an underperforming group of people. In a comparison
                between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland on
                educational attainments it was said</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Attainments in Northern Ireland are
                better by most measures. The area with the biggest difference is
                lifelong learning. The proportion of Northern Ireland adults who
                are taking Higher Education courses on a part-time basis is a
                remarkable five times greater than the proportion in the
                Republic of Ireland.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That proves the point that I made in my
                opening remarks that personal achievement and betterment through
                education that is freely available to all is a prized asset. Why
                should we not praise success? What have we against praising that
                which is praiseworthy? Sometimes we take a negative view and
                adopt a negative attitude. In a clamour about transparency,
                equality of opportunity and justice we say that it is just that
                we should point out where good performance is taking place.
                However, it is equally just to point out where underperformance
                is taking place. We are unfair if we do not indicate places of
                underachievement and publicly encourage achievement. We should
                enhance our systems to achieve proper standards.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a people, we cannot survive in the
                European or global economy, or economically perform in the field
                of information technology, unless we raise our standards. The
                method for doing that is to have openness, to publish, and to
                ensure that we are proud of what we do publish. We have enjoyed
                good standards, but there was an outburst when the Deputy First
                Minister — quite rightly — reacted on one occasion to tell
                us that he feared that our educational standards were dropping.
                Today we in the Education Committee are aware of that. Already
                we are putting in place the benchmarks and agreed targets to be
                achieved. We have discovered that at various key stages, instead
                of performance levels having risen, they have dropped from 85%
                to 77%. In another case they have fallen from 80% to 75%. People
                do not put in more money to move backwards.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a society, we have a great belief in
                education. The fact that this debate is taking place is proof
                that we want to raise our standards and be proud of our educated
                society. I support the motion, and I thank Mr S Wilson for
                tabling it. I urge the Assembly to strive for success: the old
                expression was &quot;Publish and be damned&quot;; today I say
                &quot;Publish and be proud of it&quot;.</p>

                </i><b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Education (Mr M McGuinness): </p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></b>Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann
                Comhairle. I have some sympathy with the wording of Mr S Wilson’s
                motion, but Members will not be surprised to hear that I have a
                greater sympathy with the amendment that was put down<b> </b>by
                Ms Lewsley.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to Sammy Wilson’s motion, it
                would be great if information could be published that would
                enable the good work that goes on in schools to be adequately
                measured and compared. The key word in the motion is
                &quot;adequately&quot;, because that is where the school
                performance tables fall down — they do not do all schools
                justice. Over the last year, head teachers and teachers have
                often told me how unfairly the tables portrayed their schools.
                They said that no account had been taken of the ability of their
                pupils on entry, or of the circumstances in which they worked.
                All of the teachers’ hard work was portrayed instead as poor
                performance, because their schools were ranked against more
                affluent schools. The feedback from the teaching profession was
                that the tables were divisive and demoralising. Therefore I
                decided to launch a review and a consultation process to see if
                the objectives for the performance tables could be met in other
                ways. I was also conscious that the value of the tables had
                decreased because of the significant developments that have been
                taking place in education since they were first published in
                1993.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last October, the Department of Education
                issued a consultation paper containing three options to
                post-primary schools and to a wide range of other educational
                organisations. Option one was to keep the tables but do
                everything possible to improve them; option two was to ask
                schools to publish their results in their prospectuses; and
                option three was to ask the five education and library boards to
                publish the information in their annual transfer booklets. I was
                particularly interested in the views of parents, and for this
                purpose a leaflet was sent to all parents of year-eight pupils,
                the most recent group to have received a copy of the tables when
                choosing schools for their children. I also consulted with the
                Education Committee from an early stage, and it made a valuable
                contribution to the consultation process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The consultation carried out by the
                Department of Education was comprehensive. There were over 1,000
                responses, mostly from parents and schools. Of those, 75% were
                opposed to the continued publication of tables. That applied not
                only to the responses from teachers, it also applied to those
                from parents and others. Many who responded condemned the tables
                for being divisive and unfair. They said that they failed to
                offer schools the opportunity to give parents a rounded picture
                of the school.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those who favoured the retention of the
                tables were unable to suggest how the criticisms of them could
                be addressed. A number of those who responded proposed the
                inclusion of value-added data, but no satisfactory way of doing
                this has been found, despite a continuing programme of research.
                I could not therefore see how such a proposal provided the basis
                for a realistic way forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some commented that the tables challenged
                schools to drive up standards. I am not persuaded by that
                argument — all schools want to do their best for the pupils in
                their care, and they are continually striving to improve their
                performance. Schools are legally required to set targets for
                improving their performance, and that is supported by the supply
                of benchmarking data which enables them to compare their
                performances with those of schools of similar size and with
                similar circumstances. In addition, the Department of Education
                is funding a range of initiatives that has a direct impact on
                improving standards.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I decided to introduce option two, with
                immediate effect, after careful consideration of all of the
                responses to the consultation and the views expressed by the
                Education Committee. I did so for three main reasons: first,
                this option was favoured by the majority of respondents;
                secondly, it will provide up-to-date information on examination
                performance, and thirdly, it will give parents the most complete
                set of information about any school from a single source.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Schools are already required to publish
                information about examination performance in their prospectuses.
                I am concerned, however, that the information provided is
                consistent and accurate. With this in mind the Department of
                Education has started a review of the information required to
                ensure a standard approach. It is my intention that schools and
                parents will be fully consulted in this review and that all the
                points made in Patricia&nbsp;Lewsley’s amendment will be
                considered in its course. A consultation paper will be issued to
                allow those with an interest in this matter, especially parents,
                to make their views known.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to give the Education Committee every
                opportunity to contribute to the process. The Committee has
                already made some suggestions on what information should be in
                the prospectuses, and these will form part of the review. I will
                look carefully at the responses I receive before coming to a
                decision on the way forward. Schools’ requirements on the
                content of their prospectuses are contained in the education
                regulations. Those regulations will have to be amended to give
                effect to any proposed changes. I will take this opportunity to
                update the regulations in areas that are not directly related to
                the issue we are discussing today. These regulations will be
                placed before the Assembly for approval in the normal way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me make it quite clear that there should
                still be means whereby schools can compare their performances
                with those of other schools and set targets for improvement. The
                Department of Education will continue to issue annual
                benchmarking information to schools, boards and the Council for
                Catholic Maintained Schools (CCMS). This will allow schools and
                other bodies to compare performances in the key stage
                assessments for post-primary schools in public examinations and
                attendance rates with other schools of similar size or with
                similar catchments, as expressed in terms of the proportion of
                pupils entitled to free school meals. As a basis for schools to
                set proper targets, this benchmarking information is just as
                effective as the performance tables, if not more so. If any
                Member would like to see a copy of the benchmarking information,
                I would be happy to have it sent to him or her.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My decision to end the publication of school
                performance tables is the right one for schools and parents. I
                have been heartened by the very positive response in recent
                weeks right across the spectrum. The decision has been welcomed
                by both grammar and non-grammar sectors and by parents and
                teachers. We have also shown the way for others to follow. Wales
                is currently conducting a review of its performance tables. It
                is a progressive move that will send the signal to parents that
                we want them to have the correct information when they come to
                choose a school for their children and to teachers that we value
                their hard work and dedication on behalf of our young people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to reiterate the point that the
                decision has been widely welcomed. I am open to correction, but
                I know that the Member who tabled this motion,
                Sammy&nbsp;Wilson, was, and possibly still is, a member of the
                National Association of Schoolmasters and Union of Women
                Teachers (NASUWT). The union wholeheartedly supported my
                decision. Sammy&nbsp;Wilson also made the point that I ignored
                the Executive. I did not ignore anybody. I consulted fully with
                the Education Committee, and as a Minister in my own right, I
                took a decision that was within my area of authority.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a bit rich and very hypocritical of
                Mr&nbsp;Wilson to launch that accusation against me,
                particularly as the DUP Ministers have boycotted all meetings of
                the Executive since it was established. That does not hold water
                at all. It is also important that we refute the suggestion that
                the only way to resolve the situation in schools that are not
                performing well is to publish these tables. That is nonsense,
                because information on the programmes which the Department of
                Education is involved in is available to the CCMS, the education
                and library boards and the Department through the work of our
                inspectors. Many measures are in place to ensure that there is
                support and encouragement for schools to help them to continue
                to do better.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Patricia Lewsley and Danny Kennedy raised a
                number of important points on value-added information. It is
                pertinent to state that research on this topic has been carried
                out for some years. No satisfactory means has yet been found of
                including such information in a way that would recognise
                progression made through a broad range of qualifications and be
                readily understood by parents. I do not think that there are any
                special factors relating to our schools which would justify the
                commissioning of further research, but my Department is prepared
                to continue monitoring developments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People may know that the Department for
                Education and Employment (DfEE) has been examining the scope for
                introducing value-added measures. Late last year, DfEE published
                the results of a pilot project aimed at measuring added value
                based on the comparison between students’ achievements at GCSE
                and GCE A Level. That pilot is continuing this year. DfEE are
                due to publish a consultation document in March to take views on
                the methodology to be used for introducing value-added measures
                in a series of further pilot studies, which I am told are being
                proposed. The consultation will cover how value-added measures
                might be shown between key stages 2 and 3, between key stage 2
                and public examinations at age 16, and between public
                examinations at age 16 and age 18. It is likely to be several
                years before a serviceable system is introduced; however, we
                will continue to monitor developments closely.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate Mr Tom Hamilton on his fine
                maiden speech. He effectively hit the nail on the head, and it
                amplified adequately a point I made when, prior to Christmas, I
                went to a concert in the Holy Trinity Secondary School in
                Cookstown performed by the teachers and pupils. It was one of
                the most amazing concerts I have attended in my life. During the
                evening, someone tapped me on the shoulder and asked if I was
                enjoying the concert. I said that I was, and then he said
                &quot;How do you put that in a performance table?&quot; He is
                absolutely right.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ian Paisley Jnr made a number of points about
                denying people information and made allegations of censorship. I
                am all for giving people the fullest possible information, and
                we will be able to do that adequately with the information that
                schools will provide about the holistic work they are involved
                in. As regards the review, we will have a very important role in
                ensuring that accurate and complete information is available to
                all parents. I deny absolutely the allegations of censorship
                that have been made.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will be very brief. I was not surprised at
                some of the words used this afternoon, words such as
                &quot;denied power&quot;, &quot;competition&quot;, &quot;the
                best&quot;, &quot;elite&quot; and all those things that are
                automatically assumed when you talk about a league table. Mr
                Gibson mentioned the word &quot;praiseworthy&quot;, and I would
                like to know what his definition of that is, because to me he
                was only praising those that were the best. What about the
                praiseworthiness of those who do not feature in the league
                tables? Mr Sammy Wilson talked about value for money and about
                how that needs to be output-related. How can we put a price on
                the value of learning?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Tom Hamilton asked how one measures the
                fact that it has taken two or three years to stimulate and
                improve the ability of a child who has severe learning
                difficulties. Can this be quantified in monetary terms and
                compared to the money spent on somebody who got five As in
                GCSEs? Both Mr Sammy Wilson and Mr Tom Hamilton mentioned the
                morale of teachers who are in the league and feel that they are
                the elite. But what about teachers who have worked twice as
                hard, who deserve more praise but have been totally demoralised
                because of the league tables?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask Members to support the amendment.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr S Wilson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">May I make it quite clear from the outset
                that this motion is about ensuring that whatever information is
                provided gives an adequate means of measuring and comparing
                schools. The submission by the Education Committee suggested —
                and a number of people supporting the motion have said this —
                that performanceup tables are not the be-all and end-all, but a
                guide for comparing and measuring what a school does. Many of us
                have considered what other information might be required to make
                the information adequate to enable measurement and comparison to
                take place. So let me make this clear from the start: this is
                not a defence of the performance tables as published by the
                Department. Nevertheless, I believe that they provided some
                useful information.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Patricia Lewsley and the parents she spoke
                to believe that it is for schools to deliver the information. If
                she had read the Education Committee’s document which she
                supported, it would have been clear to her that the Committee
                had concerns about schools doing this, first, on grounds of
                consistency and, secondly, with regard to gathering information
                for comparison. It appears that a number of Committee members do
                not read what goes out in their name or they would not have made
                some of the comments they have made today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Lewsley went on to say that schools ought
                to be about perpetual teaching rather than perpetual testing.
                That is a great line, but I must say that for a teacher it is a
                nonsense. Every teacher in every lesson seeks to test what he
                has done, whether by asking questions or giving homework by
                setting tests at the end of the week or examinations at the end
                of the year. Teaching is about testing. You must test what you
                have done; otherwise you do not know if you have achieved
                anything. There are various means of doing that testing, but it
                is absolute nonsense to talk about teaching outside the context
                of testing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Indeed, Ms Lewsley sat through a Committee
                meeting today in which the Department told us that one of the
                ways in which it was going to measure —</p>

                with Eileen&nbsp;Bell. She can take that as a compliment. I will
                come to that point in a moment.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the benefit of the Assembly, to my
                recollection the only Member wearing a dress at the Education
                Committee earlier this afternoon was Eileen&nbsp;Bell.</p>
                <b>

                will come to that point later<i>.</i> Stay and listen to it,
                Eileen.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will move on to Mr McHugh’s speech —
                made in his usual muddled way — in which he said that this
                decision should have been made by the Committee. The Committee
                made a three-page response, which, as far as I know, was
                endorsed by Sinn&nbsp;Féin. I will not read the response for
                the record again, but it indicated that information for
                comparison ought to be published. It proposed that information
                supplied by schools alone was inadequate and would cause
                difficulties with comparison and consistency.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McHugh told of his difficulty, which he
                later denied, in having this information publicised because the
                media could follow their own agenda. He later said that he did
                not object to this information’s being made available to
                everybody, so I am not sure whether he wants it publicised or
                not. If individual schools publish the information in their
                brochures, the papers will pick up on the information. On the
                one hand, he wants schools to supply the information, but he
                does not want it published. Once the information appears in a
                school brochure and is available to parents, it is in the public
                domain. This is typical of the position of Sinn&nbsp;Féin
                members with the press. On one hand they love it, and on the
                other they want to censor it if it does not suit them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;McHugh also spoke about how
                information did not take things such as social disadvantage into
                consideration. The motion that I have moved seeks to have
                included information that will give an adequate means of
                measuring and comparing. The Education Committee’s submission,
                which I am supporting, says exactly that. The Minister ought to
                make available benchmarking information as well as information
                on school performance, that will show all the matters that
                Mr&nbsp;McHugh spoke about. Perhaps that is why he supported it
                when it came from the Committee. However, now that it is on the
                Floor of the Assembly, he does not want to support it. It was a
                fairly muddled performance. Mr McHugh went on to say that he
                thought the abolishment of league tables was popular with
                parents, teachers and pupils. Option 2 was supported by only 40%
                of parents and pupils. A 54% majority of parents and pupils
                actually opposed option 2, the option that the Minister has gone
                for. The other figures were fairly evenly balanced: 44% to 55%,
                or 48% to 51%. There is no clear figure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Eileen&nbsp;Bell — whom I mistook for
                Patricia&nbsp;Lewsley earlier on — said that we should get a
                total picture of what goes on in schools. This is odd coming
                from a party that recently published its own performance tables
                on this Assembly, and did it look —</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will you please all settle down. This has all
                the air of a Gilbert and Sullivan comedy. We are dealing with a
                rather serious matter here. I do not think the public, the
                teachers — or the Minister — can be too elevated by the
                activities and hilarity with which this matter is being dealt.
                As to the question of what clothes people are wearing, we will
                draw a veil over that too. I ask you, Mr Wilson, to finish your
                winding-up speech.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr S Wilson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I assure Mrs Bell that, whether she seeks to
                elevate me artificially or not, I will not go easy on her. I
                will still make the points that I wish to make.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first point is that it does seem a bit
                odd that this party should talk about taking into account the
                whole picture of what goes on in a school, when it has published
                inadequate information about the performance of Members here —
                with no value-added information, nothing about the contribution
                they made in Committee and nothing about the length of time they
                stayed on a Committee. I will leave that matter aside for the
                moment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, she said that the publication of
                information about school performance and test results puts
                pressure on pupils and teachers. That was where I made a mistake
                earlier — we sat through an Education Committee meeting this
                afternoon, in which the Department outlined how it intends to
                measure targets. Those targets were all about the percentage of
                people who got GCSEs —</p>
                <b>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am coming to it. The targets were also
                about the percentage of people who got Key Stage 2 examinations.
                I think — although, again, I could be wrong — that not one
                bleat of opposition was raised. Does testing put pressure on
                schools? If so, should we not have these standards? Should the
                Minister be condemned for it?</p>

                that this was the Member’s maiden speech, you ought to give me
                a minute or two more. Mr Hamilton did make a number of very
                important points. He said that parents’ choice of a school is
                not based on academic results alone, and that is quite right. I
                am not saying that school performance tables are meant to be the
                sole basis of choice for parents, because there is a plethora of
                other information.</p>

                the past and it deals with the deficit of information which we

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That this Assembly notes with concern the
                report by the Law Centre, ‘Sanctuary in a Cell’, on the
                detention of asylum seekers and calls upon the Government to
                develop an alternative to detaining asylum seekers and to devise
                methods of expediting the application process.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend the Law Centre for publishing its
                report ‘Sanctuary in a Cell’. Many of us are aware of the
                issue surrounding asylum seekers and the treatment they are
                receiving from the authorities here, in the South and in
                Britain. The report does an excellent job of documenting that
                — it highlights some of the terrible abuses those people have
                had to put up with and the lack of welcome that many have
                experienced on this island. It makes some key and sound
                recommendations for improvements to the system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Central to the peace process and the Good
                Friday Agreement is the vindication and protection of the human
                rights of all. That must include the rights of asylum seekers,
                and not just the rights of the people native to this island. The
                detention in prison of asylum seekers waiting for their
                applications to be processed — along with convicted criminals
                in many cases — for up to eight months without charge is
                nothing less than internment. Many people in the House, not just
                on these Benches but on some of the other Benches, know only too
                well the impact that has on individuals and their families. Such
                detention only serves to increase the uncertainty and hardship
                that asylum seekers face. It does nothing to alleviate their
                difficulties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People left this country, and this island, in
                their millions as a result of political persecution and economic
                deprivation — be it Presbyterians from this part of the island
                a couple of centuries ago, people in general as a result of the
                famine or those persecuted for their Republican politics in the
                early part of the last century. It is common for anybody born on
                this island to have relatives, or people they know, who have
                left for other countries as a result of political persecution or
                economic necessity. The Irish diaspora is testament to that.
                Only in recent years has immigration from Ireland to Britain and
                the United States, particularly for economic reasons, ended.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Such experiences give people on this island a
                special insight into the plight of immigrants and exiles. We
                need that insight more than ever as we see, for the first time,
                a reversal of emigration and people coming to this island, and
                this country, and creating a more diverse Irish society. I call
                on the Assembly to back the recommendations of the Law Centre in
                its report ‘Sanctuary in a Cell’, which include the ending
                of the unneccessary detention of asylum seekers, the creation of
                non-custodial alternatives, the designation of the British Home
                Office a public body under section 75 of the Northern Ireland
                Act 1998 and full access to free legal advice and welfare and
                community services for asylum seekers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Asylum seekers are entitled to have their
                application for asylum processed and to be accommodated while
                they await adjudication. They are not to blame for the current
                housing crisis — successive Governments are. They are also not
                responsible for the low levels of social welfare — successive
                Governments are. Finally, they are not responsible for the long
                delay in the processing of their applications; again successive
                Governments are.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the first page of the executive summary of
                the report ‘Sanctuary in a Cell’, one can read that the
                British Government, in its 1999 White Paper on immigration and
                asylum, began its statement of policy principles by saying</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Any strategy for immigration control
                must, as well as reflecting operational requirements, satisfy
                fundamental policy principles. Chief among these are respect for
                human rights and for race equality.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This has clearly not been the case
                considering the experience of asylum seekers in this part of
                Ireland, the rest of Ireland and in Britain generally.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Here is one of the primary recommendations of
                the report:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;asylum seekers should be detained in
                cases of necessity, in accordance with the guidelines issued by
                the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. These permit detention in
                four narrow sets of circumstances only.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A LeasCheann Comhairle, I will struggle on
                against the background noise. You might not be able to hear it.
                The report also concludes that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;in no circumstances should asylum
                seekers be held with convicted prisoners.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, that has been the case in Magilligan
                and in Maghaberry, where women asylum seekers have been held. No
                one who heard the report this morning on the radio could fail to
                be moved by the Algerian who was detained in Magilligan prison
                for almost a year. He ended up being seriously assaulted.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A LeasCheann Comhairle, bad manners coming
                from that corner of the Chamber are nothing new. They are
                something that the rest of us have learned to live with over the
                last while.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No one could have failed to be moved by the
                experience related by the Algerian asylum seeker this morning.
                He was detained for almost a year in Magilligan prison. He was
                seriously assaulted there and was severely traumatised. This was
                a man who had left very dangerous and difficult political
                circumstances to try and find some comfort in this part of the
                world.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the key recommendations is that this
                use of detention — which, it appears, the Government here, and
                certainly in other areas, has used almost as a first measure —
                is clearly meant to be used as the very last resort. In many
                cases, it is the very first measure that authorities resort to.
                Another key recommendation from the report is that &quot;a
                dedicated accommodation facility&quot; should be developed in
                Belfast. Some concern has been expressed to me recently that the
                Government may be considering providing a dedicated
                accommodation facility in Britain. Many Republicans and
                Nationalists — in many cases very innocent Nationalists —
                know the difficulty one has in trying to sustain any sort of
                relationship while someone is detained across the water.
                Visiting is difficult, as is trying to maintain family relations
                in such circumstances. Given the number of asylum seekers who
                have landed in this part of Ireland, there is merit and
                justification in creating a dedicated accommodation facility in
                Belfast — not simply removing the problem by shipping people
                over to Britain, therefore creating an even worse problem for
                those seeking asylum here. There are many other key
                recommendations in the report, but I will not go into them,
                because the Law Centre has sent a summary to most Members. I
                urge the Assembly to fully endorse very publicly the
                recommendations made in the report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The British and Irish Governments have
                adopted an antagonistic approach to the issue. It is the
                responsibility of those in this Chamber to give leadership on
                the issue of asylum seekers and on the racism, which is quite
                often involved. The situation in the South is not good either
                and asylum seekers are being stigmatised there also. We need to
                see the development of legislation with regard to asylum seekers
                — preferably by the Irish and British Governments, so that we
                have the highest international standards in the protection and
                vindication of the human rights of asylum seekers across the
                island of Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In many instances, those who come here from
                other countries are not aware of the difficulties, the
                differences and the different jurisdictions on the island of
                Ireland. Indeed, a case was reported to me of an eastern
                European who was living in the Dundalk area with his young son.
                He was selling the ‘Big Issue’ magazine in order to raise
                some money for his son and himself, and when he moved to Newry
                to sell the publication, he was unaware that he had crossed a
                border. He was arrested and detained for a couple of months. If
                other immigrants in the Dundalk area had not cared for his son,
                he would have been taken into state care. It was hugely
                traumatising for both the father and the son.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There must be a common approach to asylum
                seekers on this island, from both the Irish and the British
                Governments, to ensure that there are no additional difficulties
                for asylum seekers if they stray from North to South or vice
                versa. We have found that Governments, particularly the British
                Government, are more anxious to deport asylum seekers rather
                than proceed with a proper system of assessment. A fair hearing
                and fair living and working conditions for those seeking asylum
                should be quickly put in place.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Cheann Comhairle, a huge richness can be
                gained from multiculturalism. Through information, education and
                political leadership, fear and misunderstanding can be replaced
                by the embracing of the growing diversity in Irish society,
                North and South. I hope that the motion will secure support from
                across the House. As Members know, this is not a devolved
                responsibility. As has been the case when other reserved matters
                have been brought before the Assembly, this is an opportunity
                for us to speak on the issue with one clear voice and say that
                the system of dealing with asylum seekers is wrong and in need
                of change. It is an opportunity to urge the British Government
                and, indeed, the Dublin Government — who, I hope, are
                listening to the debate — to take note of our concerns on this
                issue and act accordingly. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs I Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If anyone else had brought this issue before
                the Assembly, it would have been treated with more seriousness.
                However, it is either a joke or the height of hypocrisy for an
                organisation like Sinn Féin/IRA to move such a motion. This is
                an organisation with a Fascist attitude towards its fellow
                citizens, yet it is complaining about the way in which asylum
                seekers are treated in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While one may have sympathy for the plight of
                asylum seekers, serious questions must be asked about those who
                want to jump on this particular bandwagon. According to the Law
                Society, 400 asylum cases arise in Northern Ireland each year.
                However, the number of people who have become asylum seekers as
                a result of thuggish organisations like Sinn Féin/IRA is vast
                in comparison to that figure. Organisations like Sinn Féin/IRA
                have created at least 800 exiles or refugees. Did they raise any
                concerns about that? Here is an organisation that has been
                responsible for making hundreds of people exiled, forcing them
                to seek asylum across the world. Have there been any apologies
                for that? No. Has Sinn Féin/IRA ever admitted that it was wrong
                to exile its co-religionists? No. Has it issued a statement that
                not only condemns such behaviour, but tells those whom they have
                exiled and made into refugees that they can come home to their
                families? No.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no use in Sinn Féin/IRA’s coming
                to the Assembly to complain about the plight of asylum seekers,
                and bleating that more should be done for them, while it has
                created the very same circumstances for others itself. What
                about all the people whom it has turned out of their homes,
                forcing them to become refugees? These people are forgotten
                victims of our troubles. Here is an organisation that was quick
                to get its prisoners out of jail, yet it has said nothing about
                the refugees it helped create.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I might add that those who signed the Belfast
                Agreement said nothing about it either. According to evidence
                given last year, in the past, one person was being forced into
                exile from Northern Ireland every week. Of course, Sinn
                Féin/IRA denied that this was the case, but it would, would it
                not? Until this country is no longer a paramilitary haven, or a
                Mafia-run Province from which people are exiled on a whim, it
                will be difficult to get it right for those seeking asylum from
                other countries.</p>

                in which Northern exiles have been treated, and the treatment

                furnish us with briefing papers for today’s debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would usually support humane conditions for

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Give me a chance to start.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is time we accepted at least that if there
                is a motion before the House we should consider what it says and
                not use it as an opportunity to slag off other people. I hope
                that when Mr C Murphy winds up he will give us some view of his
                concerns about asylum seekers who have left this island in more
                recent years than the Presbyterian victims of establishment
                oppression over two centuries ago or the famine victims of a
                century and a half ago.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I applaud much of what Mr C Murphy said on
                the report — and I do not intend to repeat it — because it
                tackles a wide issue concerning the entire way in which asylum
                seekers are treated in this society, throughout the UK and on
                the rest of this island. There is no doubt that we have huge
                problems, such as the backlog of applications, created in large
                part by Government policy. People know that it will take so long
                to get adjudication that they are keener to come to the UK than
                they might otherwise be. It is certainly a pull factor in some
                respects because of the inadequacies of Government policy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Language, culture and past historical links
                mean that Britain, and to a lesser extent Ireland, has become a
                haven for some asylum seekers. Despite all that, we know from
                statistics in the last year that the UK was only tenth in the
                league of EU countries accepting asylum seekers. That is a small
                number compared with other countries.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion concentrates rightly on the Law
                Centre report ‘Sanctuary in a Cell’. I also add my
                congratulations to the Law Centre and, in particular, to
                Victoria Tennant for producing an excellent report which
                highlights both the legal aspects and the human suffering of the
                way in which asylum seekers are treated. We should remember that
                it is not just in prison that asylum seekers have problems. In
                many cases, asylum seekers outside prison live in deplorable
                conditions. Most of them live in houses of multiple occupation (HMOs).
                The last statistic that I saw showed that 17% of the houses were
                unfit and 80% of them were fire risks.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Asylum seekers do not receive the same social
                security payments as any other person. They have to contend with
                the demeaning voucher system. Last week, J Sainsbury — a firm
                not unconnected with the Government — felt it necessary to
                object to the administration of the voucher system because of
                its inadequacies and the unfair way in which it treated people.
                Perhaps the Government believes that these difficult, awkward,
                tough measures will deter asylum seekers from entering the
                United Kingdom. However, even the conditions that people might
                endure in Maghaberry and Magilligan will not deter those who
                have come from worse conditions in such countries as Afghanistan
                or many of the central and east African countries. The problems
                and inadequacies in the treatment of asylum seekers will persist
                while the Government makes it almost impossible for them to
                legally enter the United Kingdom. However, after a period of
                detention, those who do manage to reach the United Kingdom will
                remain.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a back-to-front policy, which leads to
                intolerable conditions for people in many circumstances. Those
                people awaiting adjudication have multiple problems: lack of
                interpreters; lack of schooling for children; lack of proper
                healthcare; lack of an adequate diet. Those problems are largely
                exacerbated when one member of the family is detained in prison.
                It is a symptom of the institutional racism that exists in
                Northern Ireland and throughout these islands and it results in
                the demeaning treatment that many asylum seekers receive.
                Undoubtedly, the sort of institutional racism that is being
                perpetrated at Dover every day is also perpetrated on people
                with black skins who get off a train at Connolly Station. It is
                time that the Assembly stated that it finds that treatment
                unacceptable, whether or not it has direct control over it. That
                racism is manifested in unrealistic demands placed upon those
                seeking entry to Britain.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the weekend, when I was thinking about
                this debate, I was given a leaflet produced by one of the
                charities that works with refugees. The front cover reads</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;In just a few minutes soldiers will
                break down your door. They’ve already killed your father and
                raped your daughter. Now they are coming for you. What should
                you take? Quick. Think. Money? Your passport? A family
                photo?&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They will also need warm clothes. That is the
                sort of decision that some people who arrive in this country
                face. They arrive with those difficulties. The Assembly should
                be objecting to those situations and making its views very
                clear. The Assembly should be working with other bodies across
                these islands to promote a diverse and pluralist society in
                Northern Ireland. This island already has a degree of cultural
                diversity with communities of first- and second-generation
                migration. Those people came from a wide range of backgrounds
                from across the world.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When it has suited the Government, economic
                migrants have been welcomed. Look at the Health Service. Even
                primary care and rural areas of Northern Ireland depend to a
                considerable extent on those who have come from overseas. Asylum
                seekers — whatever their reason for seeking asylum in these
                islands — should be treated with the same dignity and given
                the same rights as those who have come and been welcomed by the
                Government. I applaud the motion as it has been presented.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Fee:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SDLP supports the motion. It is a timely
                motion, because this is the fiftieth anniversary of the
                publication of the convention relating to the status of
                refugees. That convention sets the standards in this area and
                forms a central part of a growing body of international human
                rights law.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The focus and central thesis of that body of
                legislation — that there is an inherent dignity in every human
                person — must be highlighted. Europe receives a large number
                of refugees, but only a minority of those in the world as a
                whole. There are many other regions of the world that shoulder a
                disproportionate responsibility. However, in a global context
                the Assembly’s response will be carefully monitored. History
                will judge us harshly if we fail to respond humanely to
                contemporary refugee flows. The SDLP is fully committed to
                protecting the human rights of refugees and asylum seekers, and
                we recognise the special plight of those who flee persecution
                and make it to Northern&nbsp;Ireland. We welcome the Law Centre’s
                report and commend it for its work, not only in the report, but
                in the whole area of human rights. We are convinced that
                Governments should adopt alternative mechanisms for dealing with
                asylum seekers and refugees.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Detention should only be used in the most
                exceptional circumstances. This issue has been neglected for too
                long. Detention in prison is a profoundly unacceptable way of
                addressing the needs of those fleeing persecution. Its extended
                use in Britain and parts of Northern&nbsp;Ireland breaches
                international standards. We must never forget that those who
                seek asylum are often fleeing from the most harsh treatment
                elsewhere. We call on the Government to rethink their current
                restrictive approach and to develop policy in line with the
                recommendations contained in the report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We welcome the idea of an advisory body on
                immigration and asylum. We agree that the Home Office should be
                designated a public body and should be responsible for the
                purposes of section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998. We also
                believe that the Prison Service, like other public bodies,
                should have a comprehensive race-relations policy in place. We
                have stressed the importance of developing an anti-racism policy
                in all of Ireland, North and South.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SDLP, therefore, supports the main thrust
                of the report and we ask the Government to respond swiftly to
                its recommendations. I cannot stress enough that asylum seekers
                are not criminals. They are exercising a universally recognised
                right which is contained in article&nbsp;14 of the Universal
                Declaration of Human Rights 1948 which allows them to seek
                asylum and refuge in Northern&nbsp;Ireland. The act of seeking
                asylum in itself cannot be considered a crime.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this the fiftieth anniversary year of the
                Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, we emphasise the
                enduring importance of that legislation and, particularly, the
                valuable work of the United Nations High Commissioner for
                Refugees (UNHCR). At present, the UNHCR is undertaking a process
                of global consultations. We hope that that will result in a far
                better system of international refugee protection which will
                afford priority to the human rights of all refugees and asylum
                seekers. However, any system which might be put in place must
                adhere to the numerous international standards which currently
                apply. The 1951 convention defines a refugee as someone with a
                well founded fear of persecution.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members on all sides of the Assembly have
                seen people from our community, our neighbours and, in many
                cases, family members fleeing from persecution, from fear and
                from threat of violence. We are the very people who should know,
                better than anybody else, that to be received with compassion
                and humanity is an absolute expectation that any refugee who
                comes to Northern&nbsp;Ireland must have. We must respond to
                that. There are many other international standards. The UN Body
                of Principles for the Protection of All Persons Under Any Form
                of Detention or Imprisonment (1988) states that all persons
                under any form of detention or imprisonment shall be treated in
                a humane manner and with respect for the inherent dignity of the
                human person.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Article&nbsp;5 of the European Convention on
                Human Rights (1950) deals with the right of everyone to liberty
                and security of the person. Liberty is a fundamental human right
                which is recognised in all major human rights instruments. The
                detaining of asylum seekers and refugees in Britain and
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland is an absolute affront to those
                international standards and rights.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must take this opportunity to encourage
                everyone in our society to take a responsible attitude towards
                this issue. In every part of civic society, in public life and
                in the media we are collectively responsible for the climate we
                create on this island. We must all work towards creating a
                society tolerant of others, which has no time and no place for
                racism and xenophobia — either outside or inside this Chamber.
                Under the Good Friday Agreement we are committed to the
                protection and vindication of the human rights of all. The new
                beginning so many of us want to see in Northern Ireland must
                include human rights and equality for all of us, including those
                people who come to seek refuge with us. The human rights values,
                which we, on all sides, are committed to, must have an impact
                also on the lives of refugees and asylum seekers.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the SDLP we firmly agree that the UN High
                Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is correct when he states that
                detention should normally be avoided. Detention involves extreme
                hardship for any individual fleeing persecution. It is therefore
                profoundly disturbing that any person who is fleeing persecution
                in another state should come to Northern Ireland only to find
                himself detained. Detention has been criticised, not only by the
                UNHCR, but by the UN Committee Against Torture and the European
                Committee for the Prevention of Torture.</p>

                detained he should be detained in humane conditions, but it
                seems that the Member is suggesting that all asylum seekers
                should simply be allowed out into the community without any form
                of restriction.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am suggesting that a whole range of
                alternative support mechanisms to ensure that these people are
                treated properly and equitably needs to be put in place in this
                country and within this jurisdiction. Detention should be
                considered only as a last resort and in those circumstances.
                That is not my view or the SDLP’s view; that is the conclusion
                of almost every international body dealing with human rights.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We could recommend this report simply because
                it highlights an issue often neglected in Northern Ireland.
                However, we must also recognise that it proposes a range of
                practical measures. It clearly addresses the problem and
                contains concrete solutions. It is therefore a very timely and
                useful contribution to this debate. The SDLP firmly believes
                that detention should only be used in very exceptional
                circumstances. Asylum seekers have the right to seek refuge in
                Northern Ireland and should never be treated like criminals for
                doing so.</p>

                have to work towards eradicating the root causes of flight from

                each other and treat issues like this in this Chamber and around
                these desks, I would have thought that we might be able to

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue before the House is a reserved
                matter. Nonetheless, it gives our community many concerns —
                not least because the motion has its origins in the Sinn
                Féin/IRA quarter. The issue of asylum seekers is quite emotive.
                We have noted, in recent times, the concerns of residents in
                areas of southern England, and a number of horrific tragedies
                which have led to many deaths. An asylum seeker is currently
                easy prey for those who set out deliberately to exploit the
                vulnerable. We can readily identify the likes of unscrupulous
                hauliers who, if they so desire, can charge enormous amounts of
                money to smuggle human beings in horrendous conditions across
                frontiers. Evil drug barons will seduce them into becoming
                couriers with the incentive of a new life. One could continue
                this with a catalogue of horrendous stories but, on many
                occasions, considering their ordeals, a prison cell with support
                services can be very acceptable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The asylum seeker has become a black market
                commodity, something to be bought or sold, used or disregarded
                in the same way that we have seen so many of our young people in
                Northern Ireland used and abused by Sinn Féin/IRA. Indeed, the
                Member who brings this motion before the House knows no bounds
                of hypocrisy. On one hand he appears to be championing the cause
                of the individual who struggles against oppression, but on the
                other hand he belongs to an organisation that is inextricably
                linked to a fully armed terrorist organisation committed to
                imprisoning people against their will and dishing out punishment
                beatings, not to mention driving people out of the community to
                seek refuge in other countries. The mover of the motion is,
                unfortunately, part of a system of asylum makers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion can be broken down into two
                issues. First, the use of Magilligan and Maghaberry as detention
                centres. The Northern Ireland Prison Service has acknowledged
                that prison facilities are not appropriate for the accommodation
                of asylum seekers — we can see that in the Law Centre (NI)
                report — and that it is unable to effectively and
                comprehensively meet their needs. However, we should also note
                that, where possible, the prison service has genuinely attempted
                to adapt facilities and services to the needs of those detained.
                I believe, looking at the present figures and circumstances,
                that that is the best we can expect, particularly as the current
                Home Office review may recommend transferring detainees to
                facilities in Scotland. That would further separate families and
                stop them from joining the communities they wish to join.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members should be aware that, for most of the
                time, the asylum seeker is an unknown quantity. Let us not
                forget that in some cases one country’s asylum seeker is
                another country’s terrorist. We know nothing of their
                backgrounds or activities, or what they may have been involved
                with in their country of origin. It is only right that all
                precautionary measures and methods are adopted until such time
                as a satisfactory conclusion is reached in each case. Although
                we have an unsatisfactory situation at the moment, it is
                probably best kept in place in lieu of anticipated Home Office
                directives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The plight of the asylum seeker is one with
                which I have much sympathy. All that any decent human being
                could wish for is to be able to live and raise a family without
                fear or prejudice; to be able to work and prosper and be in
                control of their own destiny. However, the second part of the
                motion calls on Government to devise and develop methods of
                expediting the application process. It must be acknowledged that
                the main cause of this problem can lie with the asylum seeker. I
                am surprised that the average period of detention until
                information is cleared is only 54 days. It has already been
                established that background information about most asylum
                seekers is lacking.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most of them arrive in this country without
                official papers or identification. Even though those documents
                may have been in their possession when they left their country
                of origin, their papers somehow disappear once they are
                detained. Officials are then faced with the frustrating process
                of establishing an accurate picture, as in many cases false
                information is given. It may be that at a series of interviews
                conflicting answers are given, which makes the officers’ jobs
                particularly awkward and the application process virtually
                impossible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members should remember that there are two
                sides to this difficult and sensitive issue. It is best left to
                the expertise of the Home Office, rather than the
                party/paramilitary organisation that brought forward this
                motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Beggs:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have sympathy with the views expressed in
                the motion and by other Members. I believe that the origin of
                the motion is relevant. It is hypocritical for Sinn Féin to
                attempt to appear concerned about human rights, while not
                demonstrating that on the ground.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Genuine asylum seekers must be dealt with
                sympathetically and looked after. There are many people trying
                to bring normal democratic rights to their society who are being
                abused by dictators or by communist or extreme right-wing
                regimes. Society has a responsibility to assist those people
                whose lives have been put in jeopardy while trying to uphold
                democratic principles.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the other hand, many who claim to be
                asylum seekers are moving for economic reasons. Such cases must
                be dealt with speedily, and economic migrants should be
                repatriated as soon as possible, so that assistance can be
                concentrated on the genuine asylum seekers. Both groups must be
                looked after sympathetically until such times as the authorities
                can establish which group an individual belongs to.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important to note that the motion has
                been tabled by Sinn Féin. Sinn Féin/IRA and the loyalist
                paramilitaries continue to abuse human rights in Northern
                Ireland. Such groups cannot simply say that that is something
                from their past that they have left behind. Sinn Féin has yet
                to prove that it has left its past behind.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The abuse of human rights continues.
                So-called punishment beatings are an abuse of an individual’s
                body and can wreck someone’s life forever. Both sets of
                paramilitaries continue to impose exclusions; people are forced
                to leave Northern Ireland and become asylum seekers elsewhere.
                Such people stay away; they are afraid to go back home. Sinn
                Féin has yet to address that problem, although it is still
                happening today. That is hypocrisy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can speak from the experience of my town;
                the actions of Republicans there should be carefully examined.
                Republicans have imposed exclusions on Nationalists and
                Unionists from Larne. Republicans should examine what has
                happened, and I would be interested to learn whether such
                actions, carried out in the name of Republicanism, take place
                with the blessing of Sinn Féin, or are carried out by
                individuals outside the Sinn Féin family. Whatever the case,
                Republicans in Larne have forced Nationalists to move out of
                Northern Ireland. A few days ago, there was a shotgun attack in
                Larne. My information is that that attack — on a Nationalist
                family — was carried out by Republicans from that estate.
                Republicans must decide whether they have left their past behind
                them, ceased the exclusion of citizens from Northern Ireland and
                adopted purely democratic principles.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The origin of the motion is important. I am
                sorry to say that, on this occasion, although I have sympathy
                with the motion, I cannot support it.</p>

                English rule in Ireland gave us the penal laws and the famine.
                Millions of people were forced to leave the country to seek
                asylum. Many of those Irishmen and Irishwomen — Presbyterian
                and Catholic — made a new life in their new country. They also
                made a great contribution to the growth of those countries.
                Presbyterians who were forced to leave Ireland because of the
                penal laws became the founding fathers of the United States.
                People of the Irish diaspora — what the former President of
                Ireland, Mary Robinson, called the &quot;fifth province&quot;
                — are a major influence in the political, social and economic
                life of many nations. Many of those arriving here now are no
                different; they are seeking refuge from persecution and
                intolerance.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Iris Robinson and many others on the Unionist
                Benches seek to make this motion a political points-scoring
                exercise. We could all do that. For example, I could talk about
                the thousands of Catholics who were forced to move south in 1969
                as a result of pogroms by the RUC and the B-Specials. Some of
                them, for all we know, may be sitting in this Chamber. However,
                we do know that the founder of the DUP, Dr Paisley, was a prime
                mover in the lead-up to the pogroms in 1969 and certainly all
                pogroms since.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This motion, a LeasCheann Chomhairle,<i> </i>is
                about justice, tolerance and human rights. Asylum seekers are
                fleeing from persecution in countries where the arms trade
                flourishes. Any refugee who tries to come to Britain or to the
                South of Ireland on his initiative will find humanitarianism in
                short supply when he arrives. The Immigration and Asylum Act
                1999 has effectively torn up the 1951 Geneva Convention Relating
                to the Status of Refugees. The Convention enabled people who had
                a fear of persecution on the grounds of political affiliation,
                race, religion, nationality or membership of a social group to
                seek refuge in foreign countries. Today those countries do not
                want refugees from Third World civil wars. Certainly, New Labour
                in England does not want them turning up there, no matter how
                much torture or persecution they have experienced.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Act is intended to deter people from
                seeking asylum in Britain. Since the 1971 Immigration Act, the
                British authorities have used the imposition of visa
                requirements to prevent certain people from coming to Britain,
                and that legislation extends here. What is more important, if,
                under the new powers, an asylum seeker has already been refused
                leave to enter, he or she will automatically become an illegal
                immigrant on applying for asylum in Britain. The United Nations
                Convention on Human Rights has complained that the trend towards
                visa control may be in breach of the 1951 Convention.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The policy of deterrence continues when
                asylum seekers arrive here. The 1971 Immigration Act brought in
                the power to detain illegal immigrants, and that is happening
                here. Our prisons are full of innocent, persecuted people who
                are thrown into prison by virtue of this legislation as well as
                those under examination and those about to be deported.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In practice today, the Government are allowed
                to lock up hundreds of asylum seekers — often for many months
                at a time — who have committed no crime in this country. If
                they request bail, there is no presumption of liberty, and the
                Home Office requests sureties that they cannot afford. Many of
                these refugees do not understand why they are in prison or
                detention centres, and there is no limit to their detention.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government plan to extend their detention
                facilities. New legislation introduced a new procedure for those
                in prison. Detainees lose the right to go to court for a bail
                hearing. Instead, they are given a video link to a magistrate.
                There is no legal aid for representation, which means that
                detainees, who often speak no English, or a very poor level of
                the language, have to defend themselves.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Human Rights Act 1998, a LeasCheann
                Chomhairle, which is supposed to prevent the deprivation of
                liberty, does not cover asylum seekers who have sought
                unauthorised entry, in other words, those without leave to enter
                without a passport.</p>

                made a number of illegal allegations about another Member, whom

                asylum seeker has said to a immigration officer, and there is
                little provision in the current procedures to account for
                trauma; for the long and difficult journeys; or for simple
                errors in recounting how asylum seekers enter this country. The
                current legislation is racist. Asylum seekers are the persecuted
                diaspora victims of the 21st century arms race. They are
                entitled to be treated as human beings in need of our care and
                protection. They do not deserve to be treated as criminals. If
                allowed, they can make a valuable contribution to the pluralist

                can they never return to Northern Ireland? The reason is that
                his thugs will ensure that either their features are rearranged
                or they are murdered for returning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What about the situation in Londonderry where
                one of his friends lured three of these people back who were
                promptly taken out to flats in the Bogside and had bullets put
                in their heads. That is how this organisation deals with asylum
                seekers. They are invited back and then murdered.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Frankly this motion cannot receive any
                support because of its proponent. It is hypocrisy, it is wrong
                and it is a disgrace.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us now look at the terms of the motion.
                Even if someone reasonable proposed the motion, like my Friend
                Mr&nbsp;Hay here, I still could not support it. We must ask why
                Home Office authorities have to detain immigrants and asylum
                seekers in the first place. Many decent people are genuinely
                seeking asylum from persecution. We have heard the sad tales
                from places like Kosovo and we have heard of the disgraceful
                persecution of Christians in Sudan and of ethnic minorities in
                places like India. We accept that that goes on. Those people are
                deserving cases who should receive asylum in western Europe.
                That we accept.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately they are swamped by thousands
                if not millions of economic migrants who are moving from one
                part of the world to the other in order to get a better
                lifestyle. Statistics show that when the Home Office gets to the
                bottom of the various cases and checks their papers, they find
                that the main reason for the move is economic.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two recent examples have emerged. There is a
                huge increase in the number of Chinese citizens applying to do
                degrees at universities, particularly in southern England, and
                especially in London. It has been discovered that in almost
                every case, the Chinese student obtains the necessary
                qualifications by falsehood in China, applies to a university in
                England, and then promptly drops out and disappears into the
                community, never to be seen again. In a recent BBC documentary
                it has been shown that many so-called immigrants seeking asylum
                use false addresses in Bosnia or other former Yugoslavian
                countries in order to get—<i>[Interruption]. </i>Mr&nbsp;Deputy
                Speaker, someone seems to be interrupting.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They use false addresses in the former
                Yugoslavian republics in order to try and hoodwink the British
                authorities into believing that they come from a country where
                there is genuine persecution, when they did not live there in
                the first place. They then get into the United Kingdom and
                disappear.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If every immigrant who came into this country
                agreed to stay in a certain place, where his movements could be
                traced and where the Home Office authorities could contact him,
                there would be no need for detention. However, the reality is
                that a huge proportion of those who are not checked up on simply
                disappear into immigrant communities throughout the United
                Kingdom. It is estimated that there are over 1 million illegal
                immigrants in the United Kingdom. That has led to a traffic in
                humanity, which is disgraceful and which we should not be
                encouraging.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The flow of immigrants to Northern Ireland is
                thankfully smaller than to any other part of the United Kingdom
                — I believe we dealt with 71 cases last year. It is
                unfortunately an essential element of the process that those
                people are detained in secure accommodation until their cases
                are dealt with. I accept that Magilligan, Maghaberry or some
                other prison, are not the best places to keep someone seeking
                asylum. We need an alternative, which has to be secure and
                humane. The crucial point is that the person must remain there
                until his case is assessed, or until a stage is reached when the
                Home Office can decide that that person will not simply drift
                away.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have several more questions. If all of
                these people are genuine migrants, why do they pass through
                eight, nine or 10 democratic countries before they come to the
                United Kingdom? Why, for instance, does a Romanian leaving his
                country, not emigrate to Austria, Germany, Holland or France?
                There are any number of democratic countries, which are
                alternatives to Northern Ireland, or the United Kingdom in
                general. I have to suggest that one of the reasons why they pass
                through all those countries and come to the United Kingdom is
                that it is perceived that the range of social security benefits
                is better in the United Kingdom than elsewhere.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It indicates to me that a lot of this is
                simply about people wanting to better themselves economically.
                There is nothing wrong with wanting to do that, but I do not
                believe that we, as United Kingdom taxpayers, should pick up the
                bill for it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The United Kingdom, including Northern
                Ireland, is an overcrowded country. We have 56 million
                inhabitants. Frankly, we have enough difficulties trying to look
                after the socially deprived, the unemployed and the handicapped
                in our own community without a wave of economic immigrants
                coming from other parts of the world.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to reiterate that I am not against the
                genuine, persecuted individual getting into Northern Ireland.
                Remember the contribution that the Huguenots have made to this
                society. We still see their contribution throughout areas like
                the Lagan Valley. They have made an important contribution. The
                Jewish community, which unfortunately is now dwindling in
                Northern Ireland, made a very significant contribution to the
                financial well-being of the Province. However, they were
                genuine, persecuted minorities. What we are facing at the
                moment, I am afraid, is not the same. Genuine people are welcome
                in the Province, but Northern Ireland simply cannot cope with a
                wave of economic migrants.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr C Murphy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
                I am disappointed, but not surprised, at the response to the
                motion from some of the people on the opposite Benches. I had
                anticipated that, but I had hoped against hope, as I said in my
                own address. I chose not to make any political points against
                political parties. I see them running out now before we answer
                them — scurrying away from the truth and their racist rants,
                which were an embarrassment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thank God the Public Galleries were empty,
                especially when Mr Wells was speaking. Some of his xenophobic
                comments were an embarrassment to the House. Then these Members
                scurry out rather than listen to what we have to say.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sorry that that was the tone of the
                debate. The merits or demerits of the report published by the
                Law Centre, that has no political axe to grind, should have been
                debated. The fact that Sinn Féin proposed it rather than anyone
                else is merely an accident. Any Member of the House could have
                proposed it, and I dare say every Member would have supported it
                as well.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will go through some of the responses. We
                had much of the same from Members from the DUP, which is sadly
                predictable. Mrs Nelis responded well to their points about
                hypocrisy. This is the party of Ulster Resistance, the party of
                Harryville intimidation, the party of Drumcree intimidation. It
                is also a homophobic party, which not only discriminates against
                Catholics and people of other ethnic origins but also against
                people on the grounds of their sexual orientation. To take a
                lecture in human rights from people like that is a bit rich.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As David Ford and Roy Beggs said, if the DUP
                wants a debate on how communities deal with criminals in the
                absence of an acceptable policing service, it should put down a
                motion and we will gladly debate it. In essence, that is not
                what we are dealing with here. Another amusing thing is that we
                sit on Committees with these people — everyone knows this, the
                media know it and I dare say the electorate knows it,
                particularly the Unionist electorate. We sit on Assembly
                Committees, we make proposals and suggestions and we have no
                problem having them accepted by most parties. Suddenly the
                cameras appear, and people put on their super-Unionist outfits
                and cannot support anything that comes from Sinn Féin. That
                hypocrisy stands up and is seen and the Unionist electorate is
                not fooled by some of the stances taken here today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Robinson did not care to listen when I
                was speaking earlier, and she does not care to listen now
                either. So what is new? She accused me of an anti-British rant.
                Mrs Nelis responded quite clearly to Dr Birnie. We are as
                critical of the Irish Government in their response to this issue
                as we are of the British Government. It is certainly not a rant
                against the British Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome Mr Ford’s support for the motion.
                I agree with his concerns about the plight of asylum seekers who
                are not in detention and the difficulties they face. He made the
                point about people being exiled from this part of the world. My
                party and I have said that exiling people is not a satisfactory
                response to criminal behaviour. Other party members and I have
                encouraged people to adopt non-violent, community-based
                responses to crime through restorative justice projects. We have
                spent months upon months, as other parties in the House have
                done, trying to ensure the establishment of a proper policing
                service that we can all support. That would remove the need for
                communities to deal with criminals in their midst.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also thank John Fee for his support for the
                motion. I share the concerns he expressed on behalf of his party
                about the global response to refugees. I welcome his own and his
                party’s support for recommendations in the report. I
                appreciate the point he made about people being forced into
                exile. As he spoke, I was reminded of a document that hangs in
                my office, signed by Dawson Bates, one of the first Ministers
                here. It is a document that excluded my grandfather from the Six
                Counties of Northern Ireland, including Belfast. He was a
                resident of County Armagh, but was forced into exile in the
                Twenty- six Counties. He was jailed on his return to the Six
                Counties, as he tried to come home to his family. I know all
                about exile, as do plenty of people in my party. I hang the
                document in my office to remind me of the humanitarian nature of
                previous Administrations here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also appreciate Mr Fee’s point about the
                creation of a responsible attitude, and I make the point again
                about Mr Wells’s contribution and some media contributions on
                the issue of asylum seekers. That sort of racist rant stirs up a
                feeling of &quot;We cannot afford these people; they do not
                belong to the island&quot;. That is interesting coming from the
                people it does. If people had adopted that attitude, a few
                generations back this island would be a more sparsely inhabited
                place than it is now, especially this part of it. We welcome the
                benefits that economic refugees brought centuries ago, but
                suddenly the ports are sealed, the airports are closed and the
                border is sealed, and nobody is coming in to benefit from the
                lifestyle we have here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hilditch appears to adopt a confused
                attitude in that he describes asylum seekers as an unknown
                quantity; they could well be terrorists and could be
                masquerading here deliberately misleading those trying to deal
                with their applications for asylum. On the other hand, he
                professes to have great sympathy with asylum seekers. It is a
                somewhat confused response.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Beggs made the point about economic
                immigrants. People who live on this island have an extremely
                short memory as far as economic immigrants are concerned. He
                calls for them to be &quot;sympathetically repatriated&quot;, in
                his humanitarian way. If all the economic immigrants who left
                this island had been sympathetically repatriated — and I am
                sure they included people from his constituency — there would
                probably not be any room left on the island for himself.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I should not have been surprised about it,
                but I was astounded that he chose the debate to launch attacks
                on Republicans and on organised Republican activity in the Larne
                area. I have yet to hear him speak on television about the
                nightly attacks on Catholics in the Larne constituency. Perhaps
                I have missed it. The people of that area may well not hear his
                contribution.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms de Brún:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Member agree that when Mr Beggs took
                the chance to talk about Larne today he did not take the
                opportunity to talk about those nightly attacks; to acknowledge
                that it is Catholics and Nationalists who are bearing the brunt
                of those attacks? He did not chose to take the opportunity he
                had today — speaking as the Member of that constituency — to
                appeal to all constituents in the area, Protestants, Catholics,
                Unionists and Nationalists to work together. He did not ask
                people from his own constituency and from his own party to come
                out and publicly support and defend their Catholic neighbours.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be fair to say that Mr Beggs
                referred to the Loyalist paramilitaries in his speech. I assumed
                he was condemning those paramilitaries for attacks on Catholics.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr C Murphy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I give the Member’s assumption the benefit
                of the doubt.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Referring to his constituency, Mr Beggs
                appeared to grasp one incident, which he imagined had some
                relevance to Republicanism, and completely ignore the huge issue
                that has been keeping Larne to the forefront of the media in the
                last months — attacks on Catholics. Nevertheless, I am sure Mr
                Beggs can answer for himself at some stage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am disappointed. The opposition,
                particularly from the DUP, masks their declared opposition to
                the fact that the motion was proposed by me. Some of their
                contributions mask the fact that they are actually opposed to
                the Law Centre report and its recommendations. Some of the
                racist and xenophobic stuff that came from them was an
                embarrassment to the Chamber, but probably not to themselves —
                but again, they are quite hard to embarrass.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Unionist Members may unite to vote
                against the motion. If they do, they may feel they have scored
                another success over Sinn Féin and the Republican movement.
                However, the Assembly needs to send a clear message to the
                British and Irish Governments that asylum seekers here and in
                Great Britain are being handled very badly. It is a disgrace,
                given the fact that we are a nation that has sought asylum in so
                many other countries. It should be changed.</p>

                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of all the devolved Administration’s
                Departments, it is arguable that decisions taken by the
                Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety have the
                most important effect upon the daily lives of people in Northern
                Ireland. Among other factors, the quality of health care
                provision has a direct impact on life expectancy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">According to the draft Programme for
                Government, our life expectancy is lower than in other developed
                countries. We have higher numbers of patients on waiting lists
                for 12 months or longer. In the North, ill health is closely
                linked to social disadvantage, and long-term sickness rates are
                three times greater in some areas than in others. Therefore
                decisions taken by the Executive Committee in relation to health
                care will have far reaching implications for everyone in this
                region.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The recommendations of the independent review
                group, which is chaired by Dr&nbsp;Maurice&nbsp;Hayes, on the
                provision of acute hospital services is keenly awaited by
                everyone in the North. In particular, the publication of the
                review group’s report is awaited with much anticipation in my
                constituency of West Tyrone due to the gradual but consistent
                reduction in the level of acute services over a number of years.
                This has heightened the real sense of social exclusion and
                marginalisation felt by the population in this region.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The region is served by the Sperrin Lakeland
                Health and Social Services Trust which encompasses three
                district council areas — Omagh, Fermanagh and approximately
                one third of Strabane. Overall, the trust delivers health and
                social care to around 115,000 people spread across
                1,000&nbsp;sq&nbsp;miles of some of the most remote and marginal
                areas of Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I am a Member for West Tyrone, I will
                concentrate primarily on the West Tyrone area of the trust’s
                responsibilities. That includes all of Omagh District Council
                and the Plumbridge, Newtownstewart and Castlederg areas of
                Strabane District Council. Of course, it is impossible to
                discuss this part of the region in isolation because the outcome
                of the acute services review will have consequences for the
                entire south-west.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the past 20 years, the people of West
                Tyrone have witnessed a gradual deterioration in the provision
                of acute services. This can be traced back to 1979 when the
                Department of Health and Social Services and the Western Health
                and Social Services Board recommended that acute services should
                be concentrated in Altnagelvin Hospital and Enniskillen.
                However, Omagh District Council successfully made a case which
                justified a need for three acute hospitals in the area,
                including the Tyrone County Hospital.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since 1979, there has been some modest
                investment in the Tyrone County Hospital — for example, in
                1987 a satellite renal dialysis unit was located in Omagh
                because of its central location. However, the maternity unit at
                the Tyrone County Hospital was closed down in 1994, and that was
                followed by the centralisation of neo-natal and paediatric
                services in the Erne Hospital.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since then, there has been an ongoing leakage
                of services from the south-west, and from Tyrone County Hospital
                in particular. Overall, if one examines both inpatient and
                outpatient data between 1995 and 2000, there has been a
                continuous decline in the level of acute services’ provision.
                In 1995-96, Sperrin Lakeland Health and Social Services Trust
                had an average of 257&nbsp;acute beds, yet the number of beds
                had decreased by 24 to 233 from 1999 to 2000. It is worth noting
                that in the same period, the number of acute inpatient day cases
                increased from almost 3,500 to almost 5,000 —a rise of over
                500.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Statistics also show a similar decline in
                outpatient services. The number of clinic sessions held in
                Sperrin Lakeland Health and Social Services Trust hospitals has
                decreased from around 4,000 in 1995-96, to under 2,500 in
                1999-2000. There has also been a noticeable decline in GP
                written referrals to Sperrin Lakeland Health and Social Services
                Trust hospitals from 18,445 in 1995/96, to 14,057.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If one examines similar statistics in
                relation to Altnagelvin Hospitals, Health and Social Services
                Trust, there is a significant rise in outpatient activity.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This debate is not a case of the Tyrone
                County Hospital verses the Erne Hospital, or Sperrin Lakeland
                Trust verses Altnagelvin. The people I represent do not want to
                see one hospital close down or one trust receive preferential
                treatment to the detriment of patients in another trust or
                constituency. Rather, this is an issue that goes to the core of
                the Health Minister’s commitment to social inclusion in the
                provision of acute services in the entire south-west region on a
                fair and equitable basis that matches the needs of patients, as
                opposed to discriminating against patients because of where they
                live.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several models of acute service delivery for
                the region have been put forward in recent years. A report
                funded by Sperrin Lakeland Trust and Omagh, Fermanagh and
                Strabane District Councils, and published in 1997, proposed that
                the Tyrone County Hospital and the Erne Hospital could be
                developed as one hospital on two sites. However, that scenario
                received little support and the rapid deterioration of acute
                services in the west generally, and in the Tyrone County
                Hospital specifically, have made that option unworkable. A new
                area category hospital to serve the entire south-west region is
                now the best possible option.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government’s 1997 report ‘Putting it
                Right’ identified the need for patients to receive hospital
                treatment from a local hospital and recommended that hospital
                services be organised so as to ensure that all patients, no
                matter where they live, receive an equally high quality of
                health care. The report identified the need for a number of
                local hospitals that would provide general acute services to the
                local population. These hospitals would be located in Coleraine,
                the Daisy Hill Hospital in Newry and in the southern part of the
                Western Health and Social Services Board area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two&nbsp;years ago the Western Health and
                Social Services Board brought the new hospital scenario one
                stage further and conducted a review of acute services that
                examined six models of delivery. The aim of the review was to
                find, through extensive public consultation, the model that
                would best meet the public’s aspiration for accessibility to
                services, including an emergency hospital in the south-west of
                Northern Ireland. The Western Health and Social Services Board
                concluded in the subsequent report, ‘The Way Forward’, that
                acute services in the western area should be provided through a
                pattern of services based at Altnagelvin Hospital and a new
                hospital located in the south-west. Omagh District Council’s
                response to the review also endorsed the need for a new area
                hospital, but in the meantime there should be strong interim
                arrangements to maintain the existing level of services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since the publication of the Western Health
                and Social Services Board’s report, there has been a crisis of
                confidence among the population in the south-west because the
                Minister of Health and her Department appear to be avoiding the
                need to make a decision. The Minister and her Department have
                increased the level of anxiety and uncertainty around this
                issue. Many people in west Tyrone believe that the Department
                was dithering and delaying taking any decisions by
                commissioning, in July last year, a further review of acute
                services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, now that the independent review
                group will soon be publishing its report, it is important that
                we do our utmost to ensure that the people of the south-west
                receive the best possible standard of acute services provision.
                It is imperative that the review group should endorse the
                Western Health and Social Services Board’s proposal for a new
                hospital in the south-west and that the Minister support its
                recommendations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The people of West Tyrone must have access to
                the key acute services and rapid access to high-level specialist
                care. Any proposal for a new hospital must make the best
                available use of clinical practice and resources and should be
                located in an area that has the necessary infrastructure and
                public services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards the need for joined-up Government,
                the Minister’s decision must also be made with reference to
                other Government policies and the requirements of the equality
                legislation, which states that the Department must ensure that
                effective health and social care services are available to
                everyone in Northern Ireland. The Minister must also refer to
                the requirements laid down by New TSN, which requires that
                resources be targeted to the areas most in need.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Omagh and Strabane district council areas
                have been designated as suffering from high levels of social
                deprivation and long-term unemployment. The Robson index
                highlights Strabane as the most deprived district in Northern
                Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When making her decisions on other Government
                policies, the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public
                Safety must address the issues of spatial equity and sustainable
                development. The Regional Development Department’s strategic
                framework document, ‘Shaping our Future’, designates Omagh
                as a major service centre. It identifies Omagh as a town with
                strong potential for growth, and well equipped to develop as the
                major service centre for the west of the region.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Omagh has a population of 25,000, and outside
                of Derry it is the largest urban centre in the north-west of
                Ireland. The population of the entire district, which is now
                almost 48,000, has grown by 20% in the last 30 years and the
                population in the rural hinterland is approaching 150,000.
                Therefore any recommendation made by the review and any decision
                taken by the Minister should capitalise on the existing
                infrastructure, must be accessible and should make best use of
                the existing logistical, administrative and business support
                services in the region.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The people of the south-west need certainty
                on this crucial issue from the Health Minister and her
                Department. They want the Minister to have the courage to make a
                speedy decision and end the endless series of reviews. She
                should pay a visit to the Tyrone County Hospital and the Erne
                Hospital and show her solidarity and commitment to patients and
                medical staff in the south- west region.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister, with the rest of the Executive
                Committee, signed up to the draft Programme for Government. It
                included a commitment to make a difference for the better to the
                lives of the people of Northern Ireland. When the independent
                review group publishes its report at the end of the month, the
                Minister’s final decision will be a key test of her own and
                her Department’s resolve to fulfil the terms of her pledge of
                office, the requirements of the equality legislation and the
                commitments given in the draft Programme for Government to
                reduce health inequalities in the marginal and rural parts of
                Northern Ireland.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gibson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. Mr Byrne dealt
                historically with the majority of the background relating to the
                local hospitals. He rightly said that Tyrone County Hospital
                lost its maternity services in 1994. Unfortunately for Erne
                Hospital, the predictions that were made on the numbers that
                would use its maternity services did not develop as anticipated.
                As a result, Erne Hospital is limping along — and I used that
                expression yesterday when asking a question of the Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tyrone County Hospital is limping along.
                Services are leaking away on a casual ad hoc basis. That is
                despite the Minister’s assurances yesterday — which I was
                delighted to hear — that she wanted to ensure that services
                were maintained in the interim. However, that has not been the
                case.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the last occasion that I visited my GP, he
                was in a temper because he had referred one of his patients to a
                medical facility without knowing that it had been taken from the
                hospital. The patient had arrived at the Tyrone County Hospital
                only to discover that a decision had been made to take the
                facility from it. Nobody knew whether the facility would be
                available at Erne Hospital, Altnagelvin Hospital or Craigavon
                Area Hospital. The patient was left in limbo until, after a
                series of telephone calls, somebody discovered where the service
                was available.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the east of the county, South Tyrone
                Hospital has been virtually closed down.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At present Counties Tyrone and Fermanagh have
                a population of 200,000, who are more or less dependent upon the
                Tyrone County Hospital and the Erne Hospital. However, the vast
                majority of the services are dripping away from those hospitals.
                The staff feel demoralised, people have held street rallies, but
                they feel as though no one is listening. We made a presentation
                to Dr&nbsp;Hayes and his review group, and we were not just
                talking locally or parochially. We were making a point about
                good, genuine acute services for the whole south-west of the
                Province. It would take that amount of people to make one
                sustainable and viable unit. We are quite reasonable about that
                because we had a similar arrangement whereby the psychiatric
                facilities for both counties were based in one hospital.
                Therefore there is a historical precedent for the two counties
                to join and operate in unison.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Representatives from both counties made a
                presentation to the Department of the Environment for the ‘Shaping
                Our Future’ document. It is not new for co-operation and
                determination to come from both counties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People made their case to George&nbsp;Howarth
                just before the Assembly recommenced last May. We thought then
                that he was ready to issue a determination, and we were rather
                surprised when the new Minister announced another review.
                However, we are quite content to wait because we hope that it
                will only be another year. We also hope that there will be a
                favourable consideration at last that will give encouragement
                and heart to the 200,000 people who now expect, in the age of
                equality, not only transparency and justice but also equality of
                opportunity and availability of a good Health Service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People are prepared to make the 140-mile
                return journey from Omagh to Belfast to receive very specialist
                care. However, we do not see why a new provision in the
                south-west of the Province should not equally have a number of
                specialities. Not only do we have the facilities for a good
                acute service, but we also have the location and the population
                to support it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is an opportunity to make a hospital
                available in the south-west of the Province, which is attractive
                because it can provide quality and attract consultants of
                calibre. Tyrone County Hospital has a number of specialities.
                Its ENT section is known nationally and internationally.
                Specialities in kidney dialysis — chosen because of the need
                to centralise that service in the west of the Province — are
                reckoned to be equal to anything in the rest of the world.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore we are talking about people who
                have already acquired a high level of expertise. We can bring
                those people together with other experts in the various fields
                of medicine. The south-west has every good reason to expect a
                favourable outcome. After Easter I hope that the Minister will
                be able to encourage us with a favourable announcement.</p>

                </i><b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Doherty:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A LeasCheann Comhairle, there should be a
                co-ordinated strategic approach to the planning and delivery of
                acute services in West Tyrone. That would allow for the
                development of structural health care plans, accessible services
                and centres of excellence. Greater co-operation would also make
                better use of resources, build clinical expertise and deliver
                accessible services for patients and families.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another issue is that many of the
                inequalities in the provision of acute care are a direct result
                of the fragmentation of planning and the parochial nature of
                boards. With the four area boards limited to overseeing the
                planning and delivery of acute services for their respective
                areas, there can be no overall strategic approach.
                Responsibility for planning and funding must be removed from the
                present board structures and given to a regional acute planning
                service established within the Department. The service would
                then have the widest possible remit to develop, in co-operation
                with other bodies, centres of excellence and co-ordinated
                regional services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department must also develop regional
                patterns in the siting of acute care. Such an approach could be
                expected to provide major benefits that would obviate
                duplication of services and produce savings through the sharing
                of resources. That would also enable cross-border co-operation
                on high technology, leading to the distribution of complex and
                expensive procedures to designated centres of excellence
                throughout the island, as well as a greater responsiveness to
                the more isolated communities, such as West Tyrone.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Levels of planning should be clear,
                transparent and inclusive, and must uphold both the letter and
                ethos of equality legislation. I believe that in the planning,
                funding and siting of acute care in West Tyrone, the Department
                should establish a body comprising service users or their
                representatives, trade unions and the full range of health care
                professionals. The cross-border approach could be developed
                under the aegis of North/South co-operation, reporting to and
                accountable to the North/South Ministerial Council.
                Alternatively, the body could report to the respective
                Ministers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The concept of accountability should not be
                solely applied to the central planning, funding and siting of
                acute care facilities. There should be greater accountability in
                the management of local hospitals and greater openness and
                transparency in hospital management. Trade unions and service
                users should be included in the management of hospital care.
                Unelected and unaccountable bodies are not the way forward. The
                Assembly and its associated Committees could provide oversight
                and help to assure the accountability of the Department. The
                structure of all aspects of acute care must be less bureaucratic
                and more cost-effective.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It must be accepted that an inaccessible
                service is not a quality service. Just as targets for waiting
                lists for in-patients and waiting times at accident and
                emergency units are used to evaluate the quality of service, it
                is incumbent to develop and implement such a target for
                accessibility. The Health Department must take account of the
                realities facing people in rural areas who need access to acute
                services. Their difficulties are of a cross-cutting nature,
                relating to time and distance — poor road infrastructure, lack
                of car ownership and, thus, dependency on public transport,
                which does not always exist or operate at the most appropriate
                time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are difficulties in achieving a balance
                between the accessibility of services and the provision of
                modern, high quality standards of care. However, the quality of
                care one receives cannot depend on where one lives, so Omagh
                must have acute hospital services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The increase in waiting lists and the
                decrease in quality care stem from the reduction of the number
                of beds, the closure of hospitals and increased seasonal
                pressures. The current configuration of services within the
                hospital settings must be questioned. If care can be delivered
                locally, it should be. I accept the need to concentrate some
                services so that specialist teams have access to a wide range of
                clinical and technical backup. However, I see no reason for the
                majority of regional services being sited in Greater Belfast.
                Such a high concentration inside this limited area does not
                reflect an equitable and accessible hospital service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In siting acute service care, one needs to
                take cognisance of the interface between the acute-care sector
                and community-based services. Some of the consequences of the
                proliferation of trusts and the preserved incentives of the
                internal market are particularly evident in this area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The abolition of both the internal market and
                unaccountable, unrepresentative quangos is a prerequisite to the
                establishment of an accessible and equal health service. There
                should be an effective integration of service and a smooth
                transition between health sectors reflecting patients’ needs
                and the effective use of resources.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The review group must address the endemic
                underfunding of the Health Service and the piecemeal planning
                which wastes resources and duplicates management. A LeasCheann
                Chomhairle, recent cases have shown that quotas are not a true
                measure of quality. They promote the attitude that the
                attainment of specific targets is more important than the
                treatment of patients. They have been the driving factors behind
                acute-service reviews and the withdrawal of acute services from
                some areas. Some services have been removed from hospitals, not
                because there is no need for them, but because there was not the
                requisite number of patients to meet arbitrary quotas set by the
                Royal Colleges.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate Mr Byrne on raising this
                important issue. I appreciate the importance of local hospitals
                to the communities that they serve. One of the real challenges
                facing us in the coming years is to build on the tradition of
                local service, while ensuring that patients have access to the
                best that modern medicine has to offer. I welcome the Member’s
                acknowledgement of the vital importance of my portfolio and of
                health and social services. As he acknowledged, it is not merely
                a question for myself, but of the importance that the Executive
                places on the Health Service in its decisions. I know the local
                geography and appreciate the central roles that the hospitals in
                Omagh and Enniskillen play in the life and well-being of their
                respective communities. I share many of the concerns that have
                been expressed and agree that local communities must play a part
                in the development of services in their area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The difficulties that small hospitals face in
                seeking to maintain a broad band of acute services are not
                unique to these hospitals, and Members have recognised that. All
                our smaller hospitals are confronted by the dilemma of how to
                recruit and retain staff and how to meet the demand for
                continuous improvement of standards. The challenge is to balance
                the necessary pursuit of excellence with accessibility,
                especially for rural communities. Our services must build on
                developments in medicine, technology and drugs if they are to
                meet the needs of our population. Such developments frequently
                exert pressure for the centralisation of services, as in the
                case of cancer treatment. However, we must also be conscious of
                the opportunities to decentralise and localise care offered by
                new technologies, such as tele-medicine, and modern clinical
                networking. Such developments breathe fresh vigour into
                otherwise isolated services at smaller hospitals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate the strength of support for
                these and other local hospitals; it has been eloquently
                expressed by Members today. I share the concerns about pressures
                on local hospitals and the fears that they have been blighted by
                a lack of clear direction in respect of future service
                provision. That is why I set up the review of acute hospital
                services under the chairmanship of Dr Maurice Hayes. Dr Hayes
                and his team have held meetings in the communities served by our
                smaller hospitals and have had fruitful discussions with many
                community groups and individuals about the future of acute
                services and how they might develop.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I await the report with great anticipation.
                Its publication will furnish us with an opportunity to debate
                afresh how our services must develop, but, while the review is
                ongoing, it would be inappropriate for me to make advance
                comment on the way forward. I expect to receive the report in
                the spring and intend to consult fully on it, before coming to
                any conclusions. In the meantime, I expect trusts to maintain
                their current acute services in our smaller hospitals, unless
                that would seriously compromise patient care and treatment.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At any point where services are not to be
                maintained, any transfer of services must be temporary. I am not
                clear about the reference made by Oliver Gibson to a specific
                case, but if he wishes to write to me I will be very happy to
                take the matter up with him.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the other points raised by Members, I
                share their desire to ensure the availability of a good acute
                Health Service. That is what I expect to come out of the acute
                hospital review. I believe that it is important to build on the
                strengths of our current services and staff. I am absolutely
                committed to developing open and transparent Health Service
                arrangements that actively involve, and listen to, local
                communities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Byrne in his opening comments referred to
                ‘Putting it Right’. That paper reflected the views of
                Ministers at that time in relation to the pattern of services.
                It does not necessarily reflect my views, and I have said before
                that I want to take a completely fresh look at these issues. Had
                it not been for the four-month suspension, I would now have been
                in post for a year. In that period I have taken on board the
                questions that need to be tackled. I have very proactively taken
                forward some of the concerns mentioned by Mr Byrne in his
                opening speech. These include the question of the health of our
                population and the need for a public health strategy that goes
                wider than the Health Service, the question of the future
                pattern and development of primary care services, and the very
                critical question of acute hospital services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reference was made to North/South linkages,
                and Pat Doherty referred to the need for an overall strategic
                approach. I agree totally that we need to develop a regional
                view of acute services. There are no boundaries in my thinking,
                and no boundaries have been set in the terms of reference of the
                acute hospitals review. We need to look at ourselves in this
                broader context and to build arrangements in the interest of all
                our people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On North/South development, I am committed to
                building up effective linkages, and that is included in the
                terms of reference of the acute hospitals review. I am
                consequently open to any suggestions that Members may wish to
                put to me regarding the construction of cross-border
                partnerships that can work in the interests of patients.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the review of administration
                that is being taken forward, and any consequent changes and
                structures, my first priority, after the years of uncertainty,
                must be to set an appropriate direction for our hospital
                service. The form of administration required to operate such a
                service should be influenced by its functions, as determined in
                the light of the acute hospitals review. I would stress again
                that there is no question of my avoiding a decision. I have
                acted decisively to address this and other issues in the short
                — and somewhat difficult — period of suspension.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The points raised by the Member regarding
                waiting lists and winter pressures are matters that I have
                vigorously tackled. I can confirm to Joe Byrne that any
                decisions taken as a result of the independent review will be in
                line with the principles of TSN, and they must be assessed and
                equality proofed in line with section 75 of the Northern Ireland
                Act 1998.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the question of rurality, I absolutely
                recognise the specific problems facing rural communities. I am
                prepared to take those into account in developing the required
                acute hospital strategy for the future, and, therefore, the
                issue is referred to in the remit of the acute hospitals review
                group. Reference was made to other Departments, and I trust that
                my Colleagues in the Executive are taking similar steps to
                ensure that their strategic planning takes account of the
                interests of rural communities. That point was certainly taken
                forward in our discussions on the Programme for Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Looking to the future, I am committed to
                creating a new and better hospital service. I will build on the
                report of the acute hospitals review group to stimulate an open
                and informed debate on the way forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At this stage I cannot say any more about the
                outcome of this process. I can say that I am committed to
                creating a modern and effective hospital service which will meet
                the needs of our population in this new century; a service which
                will provide a standard and quality of care comparable with the
                best in Europe; a service that will use technology in the
                interest of its users. We need a service that takes account of
                the overall needs of our population, which must, and will,
                include those people who live in rural areas.</p>
