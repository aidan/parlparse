	        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
	        <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="1"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
	        <p class="H4StageHeading">Provisional Out-turn for 2007-2008</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice from the Minister of Finance and Personnel that he  wishes to make a statement on the provisional out-turn for 2007-08.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr P Robinson)</strong>: In June 2007, the Assembly voted to  approve the spending plans for 2007-08 that were inherited from direct rule  Ministers, and which provided for current expenditure of &pound;8,259,000,000 and  capital expenditure of &pound;1,409,000,000 in budgetary terms. Today, I will report  on the extent to which Departments have spent the money for which they bid and  were subsequently allocated. In headline terms, the underspend by Departments  was &pound;177 million in respect of current expenditure, and &pound;76 million in respect  of capital investment.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Members will be well aware that, through the Budget,  Estimates and in-year monitoring processes, the Assembly continues to spend a  significant amount of time and effort debating the funding that is allocated to  Departments. That reflects the importance of prioritising the limited funding  that is available to the Executive in order to deliver the best possible public  services to the people of Northern    Ireland. However, Departments often put too  great an emphasis on the size of their budget, rather than on the outcomes that  they can achieve. Given that imbalance, and the relative lack of robust and  timely information on outcomes, the actual expenditure of Departments against  their plans must be considered as a proxy for delivery.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">There is little point in the best-laid plans being put in  place if Departments do not subsequently deliver the planned services,  primarily by spending the funds that have been made available to them. Although  it is critical that Departments do not overspend, it is equally important to  ensure that &mdash; to the greatest extent possible, and with due regard to value for  money &mdash; the amounts that are provided are spent. Significant levels of  underspend imply that fewer services have been delivered than had been planned,  and that resources have been retained when they should have been redeployed to  improve services in other areas.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In that context, I shall provide Members with detailed  figures of the actual spending levels by Northern Ireland Departments in  2007-08, with particular reference to performance against plans. Details of the  provisional out-turns for each Department &mdash; covering current expenditure and  capital investment &mdash; are set out in tables 1 and 2, which are attached to the  printed copy of my statement.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In my statement of 25 June 2007, I highlighted the fact  that the Executive inherited a situation in which, in recent years, Northern  Ireland Departments had underperformed when maximising the spend from funds  that had been allocated to them. That situation has also been recognised by the  Committee for Finance and Personnel, which advocated a 1% target for the  maximum underspend rate for current expenditure.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The provisional out-turn returns for 2007-08 indicate that  the total current expenditure by Departments was &pound;8&middot;2 billion, which represents  real terms growth of 4&middot;9% in 2007-08. However, Departments spent &pound;177 million, or  2&middot;1%, less than had been planned. That headline rate is unchanged from 2006-07,  and, given the significant efforts over the past year to improve and raise the  profile of financial management, it indicates a somewhat disappointing  performance by Departments.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Members will not be surprised to hear that the overall  underspend figures mask significant variations among Departments. The  Department for Regional Development (DRD) was the best performer, with a 0&middot;9%  underspend, and the Department for Employment and Learning (DEL) was the worst,  with a 3&middot;9% underspend. My Department had the fourth-highest underspend at  3&middot;1%; however, that is a significant improvement on the previous year, when it  underspent by 10&middot;7%. Although the Department of Finance and Personnel (DFP)  clearly has some way to go to be the example to others that it should be, that  improvement on past performance demonstrates the extent of change that is  possible with a sustained focus on the issue.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Other Departments such as the Department of Agriculture and  Rural Development (DARD) and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment  (DETI) also managed to reduce their underspend rate compared with last year,  and I urge them to continue the good work. However, it is disappointing that  the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety (DHSSPS), DEL and the Department  of the Environment (DOE) performed worse in 2007-08 than in the previous year.  Although all Departments can rehearse excuses and highlight supposedly  extenuating circumstances, the simple fact is that either their planning or  their delivery mechanisms were deficient.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Although I recognise that some Departments made good  progress, in general, Departments are still some way from the ultimate goal of  reducing the underspend rate to the Committee of Finance and Personnel&rsquo;s target  of 1% or less, and only one Department &mdash; DRD &mdash; managed to achieve that  benchmark in 2007-08. The challenge for other Departments &mdash; including my own &mdash;  is to match that performance level.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In recent years, an area of particular concern has been the  spending performances of ring-fenced central funds, which have often  experienced substantial levels of underspend. Although the underspend rate for  priority funding packages is lower than in previous years, it is still  considerably higher than the average for Departments in current expenditure and  capital investment. For example, the environment and renewable energy fund  underspent by 13&middot;5%, and the children and young people&rsquo;s fund underspent by  4&middot;3% on current expenditure. Those levels of performance justify the  Executive&rsquo;s decision, as part of the Budget, to mainstream those funds into  departmental baselines in order to engender a greater sense of responsibility  in Departments for the associated projects.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">That decision also obliged those Departments to consider  how much of their increased allocations should continue to be targeted at areas  that were previously funded from central funds. It did not mean &mdash; as some  Departments appear to have suggested &mdash; that they could simply take the  additional funding, allocate it to something else and then claim that they had  no money left to meet pressures in areas that were previously funded from  central funds.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Given the greater potential for capital projects to be  delayed and their greater propensity to be one-off or innovative in nature,  Members will be aware that the percentage underspend on capital projects has  traditionally been higher than on current expenditure.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The provisional out-turn returns indicate that Northern  Ireland Departments have delivered &pound;1&middot;1 billion in 2007-08 in net investment.  That is the highest figure on record, representing real-terms growth of 9&middot;3% on  the year before.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The consequence of that level of actual expenditure is that  Departments have spent &pound;76 million &mdash; or 6&middot;3% &mdash; less than had been planned for.  Compared with the performance of Departments under direct rule &mdash; when the rate  of underspend reached 18&middot;2% in 2005-06 &mdash; that outcome represents significant  progress on past performance.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">However, although overall performance is reasonable, that  outcome is the consequence of strong <strong>performances  by two Departments</strong>: DHSSPS and DRD. I commend both Departments on their  management of capital projects. Notwithstanding, below that high standard lies  a great variation in performance between Departments, ranging from an 8%  overspend by the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister  (OFMDFM), to a 34&middot;6% underspend by DARD. In total, five Departments had an  underspend of 15% or more.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I acknowledge the fact that DFP has performed particularly  well as regards capital expenditure, with only DHSSPS and DRD having a lower  level of percentage underspend in 2007-08. That is in contrast with the  position in 2004-05, when DFP had an underspend of 88&middot;3%, and hence had spent only  12% of its allocated funding.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Although the headline performance is one of continued  improvement, as with current expenditure, the position needs to be seen in the  context of the substantial amounts of reduced requirements and re-profiling  requested by Departments during the year. If Departments are serious about  delivering on time the infrastructural improvements set out in the investment  strategy, that level of performance must not be repeated in the coming years.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Although I have focused on the importance of avoiding  excessive levels of underspend, it is equally important to emphasise that  Departments should ensure that they do not overspend against their <strong>approved allocations. Unfortunately, two  such cases have arisen this year</strong>: the Department for Social Development  (DSD) and OFMDFM. Although the Executive will, of course, want a full  explanation for the reasons for that overspend and will wish to consider the  appropriate response, it is also essential that we ensure that, as has been the  case in the past, an unreasonable fear of overspend does not drive higher  levels of underspend.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I have heard it said many times that one gets shot for  overspend, but simply flogged for underspend. However, I believe firmly that we  must ensure that there is a proportionate view of those two wrongs. In that  context, I ask which is really worse: a small overspend, or a failure to  deliver hundreds of millions of pounds of public-service improvements both  promised to and paid for by the public, at least in part, through their  regional-rate payments?</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The answer is, of course, that both are to be avoided, but  we must recognise that, if we are to reduce substantially the level of  underspend, the risk of overspend will increase. I appreciate that that is a  difficult issue, as the principle of avoiding overspend at any cost has rightly  been at the heart of public-expenditure control for many years. I will want to  consider that issue further with my Executive colleagues, but I am clear that,  as in other areas, we need to be prepared to challenge accepted practice if we  are to secure the sort of improvements that the Executive aspire to achieve.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Although I have set out the 2007-08 provisional out-turn  position for individual Departments, the Executive as a whole are facing the  key emerging issue of equal pay for some grades in the Northern Ireland Civil  Service. Although more work is required to establish precisely the level of  funding that will be needed to address that problem, it is clear that the costs  will be material and will have clear implications for public services here.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">One option that we are currently considering is whether  some of the underspend declared by Departments for 2007-08 should be used to  fund part of the equal-pay claim. That will mean that that funding would then  not be available for future years, and hence would have a clear cost as regards  the future delivery of public services.</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive must, therefore, take great care in balancing  the need to ensure fair and equitable treatment for staff with the imperative  of delivering the best possible services for all of the people of Northern Ireland.  Work on that is progressing, and the Assembly will be given an update later  this month as part of the June monitoring statement.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The challenge of financial management manifests itself as  not only the level of spend against plans, but as the monthly profile of spend  throughout the year. Departments continue to demonstrate a clear profile of  steady spend throughout the year, with a significant surge in expenditure  towards the year end.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Although there may be legitimate reasons for that, it  raises concerns whether that expenditure represents value for money or simply  reflects a &ldquo;use it or lose it&rdquo; mentality in Departments. Despite concerns  regarding underspend, and the timing of access to the Executive&rsquo;s end-year  flexibility (EYF) stock, I prefer the adage that &ldquo;no spend is better than bad  spend&rdquo;. It is important that Departments recognise that, under the Treasury&rsquo;s  existing end-year flexibility arrangements, although the amounts underspent  might not be automatically available in subsequent years, they will be  available at some point and are not, therefore, lost to the Executive.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, the skewing of expenditure towards the end of  the year implies that spending has been delayed. Although that phenomenon is  not recognised in the headline figures, months, weeks or even days of delay can  be important with regard to public services, whether new textbooks for schools  or the repair of potholes.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Although the starting figures on underspend send a strong  signal to Departments that they need, substantially, to raise their game with  regard to performance in general and financial management in particular, there  is an equally compelling message to those Ministers who seek to press for  additional funds. Over the past 12 months, I have been subject to subtle, and  some not-so-subtle, approaches from Ministers to increase the funding allocated  to their Departments. With resources becoming increasingly tighter, I &mdash; and, I  am sure, my successor &mdash; will not countenance the allocation of funding that  simply sits unused. That is not acceptable to me, as I am sure that it is not  acceptable to Members, or to the general public, who have waited long enough  for the return of locally-accountable Government to deliver improved services.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Although I commend the progress that has been made by some  Departments in reducing underspend, much more can be achieved, individually and  collectively. Although ultimate responsibility for that rests with accounting  officers in Departments, there is a role for DFP, Ministers and the Assembly.  The steps that have so far been taken to improve financial management skills  and raise the priority given to financial issues may not yet have had  sufficient time to bed in, and will, therefore, have an impact on the level of  underspend for 2008-09 and beyond.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">That on its own, however, may not be enough, and other  options must be considered to provide a stronger incentive for improved  performance. Those include setting targets and sanctions at organisational and  individual levels, and taking greater account of a Department&rsquo;s underspend  performance when prioritising funding, or even revisiting the Budget  allocations. Moreover, Assembly Committees have a role to play, and I look  forward to reports of the challenges from Committees to their respective  Departments on their underspend performance.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive has set out a challenging programme of work  to improve the lives of people in Northern Ireland over the next  three years. We must not fall at the first hurdle as a result of an inability  by Departments to carry out the fundamental act of spending the funds that have  been allocated to them, thereby delivering the planned level of services.  Spending plans will be informed by the ability of Departments to spend what  they have been allocated, or to make that money available to others as early as  possible in the process.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel (Mr McLaughlin)</strong>: Go raibh maith  agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement, and support its  robust criticisms about underperforming Departments. The figure of 2.1%, or  &pound;177 million, underspent in current expenditure is disappointing, and is the  highest rate of underspend in the past four years.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">That performance is especially disappointing given the  tight public expenditure environment and the need to maximise the impact of available  resources. The Minister referred to the target that the Committee for Finance  and Personnel proposed in its report on the draft Budget for 2008-2011, which  advocated a maximum rate of underspend of 1% for current expenditure. The  Committee arrived at that conclusion following analysis of previous patterns of  underspend here and in other jurisdictions. Experience and practice elsewhere  have demonstrated that that target is achievable. Therefore, given the emphasis  that the Department and the Committee have placed on robust financial manage&shy;ment  in Departments, what additional steps can be taken to address the culture of  underspend in Departments, which has been inherited by the Executive?</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister also state how the underspend in his  Department has affected delivery of services in 2007-08?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I thank the Chairperson and members of the Committee  for Finance and Personnel for taking a great interest in the performance and  underspend of each Department. Additional steps could be taken, but some of  those might be considered to be too revolutionary to be accepted by the  Executive. For example, at one point, I asked officials to rework mechanisms in  the Civil Service so that the Department of Finance and Personnel could have a  presence in the finance sections of each Department. That would have enabled  DFP to obtain a better level of information, because it is only after a  financial year is over that DFP obtains a clear picture of each Department&rsquo;s  final position.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">As has been seen, Departments hold on to money  unnecessarily, rather than give it up at an earlier stage to enable it to be  spent elsewhere. At an individual level, accounting officers could be made more  accountable with respect to underspends &mdash; for instance, it could be one of the  factors taken into account in relation to bonuses earned in the senior levels  of the Civil Service.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">However, one option that is open to us all &mdash; and which I  would consider seriously &mdash; is that where there is a pattern of underspending by  a Department, it should be taken into account when determining that  Department&rsquo;s future year allocations. Indeed, a case could be made for  reviewing the allocations for the remaining years in this comprehensive  spending review period to take into account the inability of Departments to  spend their money.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, there are several sanctions that we need to  consider, because we simply cannot continue to have a situation whereby &pound;177  million that could have been spent in Northern Ireland in the last  financial year was not spent.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. What implications will the out-turn have  on the Executive&rsquo;s access to its stock of end-year flexibility? Have any  negotiations taken place? If so, what was the outcome? The Minister also  pointed out the important role of Statutory Committees, and he will be aware  that those Committees are facing difficulties in receiving departmental  submissions on monitoring rounds. What can be done to ensure that that  situation does not continue?</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">As a member of the Committee for Education, I ask the  Minister for Finance and Personnel to comment on an accusation that was made by  the Minister of Education on 20 May during a debate on the extended schools  funding programme, when she said that funding for that programme had been cut  because DFP had not provided sufficient funds for it.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for Finance  and Personnel raised three issues. First, with regard to end-year flexibility,  I said that although a substantial part of my statement focuses on the  provisional out-turns of each Department, one pressing issue for the Executive  relates to equal pay for some grades in the Civil Service. A significant amount  of money will be required to deal with the six years&rsquo; back pay to which those  members of staff are entitled under the law.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">We have already begun discussions with the Treasury about  receiving an allocation from our underspend for that purpose. If successful, we  would retain those funds, which would not be placed into the normal end-year  flexibility stock. I emphasise that Members and, in particular, Ministers must  be aware that, in the past, we were allowed to keep any underspend  automatically, whereas we must now bid, negotiate and argue with the Treasury  to receive that funding. It is conceivable that, because UK finances are  tight, the Treasury could restrict future allocations if we do not use our  allocations fully. Therefore, it is imperative that we improve financial management.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">It is a Committee&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure that any  papers that it requires are delivered. Committees have a statutory right to  receive papers and to summon people to appear before them, and they must be  more robust in demanding that information. If Members want me to investigate  specific cases, I would be pleased to do so.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Storey mentioned education; I understand that a  particular Department of Education programme required funding of approximately  &pound;4 million, and the Minister of Education decided &mdash; according to the headline  in &lsquo;The Irish News&rsquo; &mdash; to blame me for allocating insufficient funds. My answer  to that is: just look at the Department of Education&rsquo;s underspend of &pound;50  million. With better financial management, the Department of Education could  have conducted more than a dozen of those programmes.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Does the Minister accept that the Department of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety was much closer to achieving targets in the two spending areas  than most Departments and, in particular, his own Department? Furthermore, does  he agree that, because revenue reflects a pattern of need whereas capital is a  planned process, tackling capital underspend should be easier and, therefore,  is a more disappointing result?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Finance  and Personnel</strong>: The figures show that the Department of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety had the highest underspend of &pound;54&middot;8 million, whereas  my Department had an underspend of &pound;6&middot;1 million. However, that outlines the  amount only, and the Member&rsquo;s reliance on percentages illustrates the  Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety&rsquo;s massive allocation. I  recall a debate during which I was told that the Department of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety needed to receive an extra &pound;300 million a year; it  is difficult to swallow that point if the Department returns &pound;55 million at the  end of the year.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">However, I commend the Department of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety for its record on capital allocation, which, as the Member  said, is more difficult to control because legal planning and other issues can  make it difficult to achieve the appropriate out-turn. Therefore, the  Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety shows mixed results &mdash; a  large underspend of its resource but a good capital expenditure out-turn.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  Given the demand and support for renewable energies, the environment and  renewable energy fund&rsquo;s underspend of 13&middot;5% will cause disappoint&shy;ment.  However, the public will welcome the news that the Northern Ireland Assembly&rsquo;s  allocation was under&shy;spent by &pound;3&middot;4 million, which is 7&middot;6% of its budget.</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">11.00 am</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I commend certain Departments for their very good results.  I wonder whether it is easier for some than others. For example, one can  envisage that DRD can spend rapidly on roads maintenance; we all accept the  great need for that, and that is an area in which spending can get going  quickly.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I accept the Minister&rsquo;s comment that no spending is better  than bad spending. Nevertheless, is there a model that Departments can  replicate &mdash; namely, have in readiness meaningful schemes to use up budgeted  funds &mdash; or can he say anything else about best practice that would prevent  underspend and overspend?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Let me start where the Member finished. The  expenditure should all be planned; it should not be about holding things back  that can be pulled out suddenly at the last minute if there is a bit of money  left over. Departments should have plans in place to spend the money that is  allocated to them. They should not keep money in reserve that can be pulled out  of the hat at the last minute.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The whole idea of a budgetary process is for Departments to  look forward to what they want to accomplish during the following years and to  utilise the funds that are necessary to achieve their targets. There should be  plans for the expenditure of all that money. If a Department discovers that it  is falling behind, as can happen in the case of capital funding and in resource  funding, it must free up the money as early as possible in the financial year  so that other Departments can use it &mdash; or, indeed, it can bid to use the money  for another purpose. That is a matter of financial planning; it is not simply a  case of having something in a back pocket that can be pulled out if there is a  bit of money left over.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I share the Member&rsquo;s disappointment at some of the high  levels of underspend on renewable energy. I hope that mainstreaming those  funds, rather than having them in the Executive priority funds, will help us to  deliver better. Although some departmental underspend levels are bad, they are  all better than the priority funds had been, which are somewhat detached from  the Departments.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Member also asked whether it was easier for some  Departments to reach their targets than others. He is right; we all see  roadworks staring to appear more frequently in the last few months of the year  as DRD uses up its allocation. That is no bad thing, however, because that work  must be done. In that case, I am not so worried about the upgrade and the  curve, because it is not simply a case of taking on work that would not  otherwise be done. That work should be done, although the money for it is being  used up at the end of the year.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">DRD&rsquo;s record is exceptionally good, both in revenue and  capital terms, and it has been able to plan its programmes well on both  accounts. I hope that, to some extent, on the capital front, that is down to  the assistance that was provided by a previous Minister, who introduced a  preparation pool so that schemes would be prepared and ready to move as soon as  funding was available for them.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  First, in what may be his last appearance at the Dispatch Box as Minister of  Finance and Personnel, I acknowledge, on behalf of the opposition, the  Minister&rsquo;s contribution in that role. Although we may not have agreed with  every decision that was taken, I certainly respect his mastery of his brief.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister see any correlation between the levels of  current underspend and the Departments that are making bids under the  monitoring rounds? Does he see the monitoring rounds as a means of enforcing a  greater degree of discipline on Departments? How does Northern Ireland compare with the latest figures  from our counterparts in Scotland  and Wales, and the UK as a whole?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I am not sure whether I should refer to the Minister as &ldquo;the  Government Minister&rdquo;.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I thank the Member for  his kind remarks. I, at least, am one of those who recognises the importance of  the role of an opposition. I know that many of the Member&rsquo;s criticisms are  merely synthetic because of the role that he has in opposition, and that he  feels that he has to make those comments. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Member is right to draw attention not just to the issue  of underspend at the end of the year, but to link it to the in-year monitoring  rounds.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Let us not forget that money that is given up during the  course of the year, as well as money that is left over at the end of the year,  is money that is not going towards expenditure that was planned at the  beginning of the year. If one adds the amount that was given up during the  in-year monitoring rounds to the end-year flexibility figure, one ends up,  effectively, with underspend of &pound;400 million. The original budgets that were  set out at the beginning of the financial year have been underspent by about 4%  or 5%.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The figures are worse for capital spend, because only about  60% of the planned capital expenditure actually took place.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  As has been said, table 1, attached to the printed copy of the Minister&rsquo;s  statement, indicates that the underspend in the Department of Health was &pound;55  million. The Minister has already confirmed that that money has been lost to Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  public expenditure. How can that underspend be reconciled with the Health  Minister&rsquo;s claim, during the Budget process, that his Department was  underfunded by &pound;300 million? Bearing in mind that those who work in the  mental-health sector &mdash; the Cinderella sector &mdash; are crying out for resources,  particularly in the areas of suicide and self-harm and units and beds for  children and adolescents, does the Minister agree that that is an abysmal  showing on the part of the Health Minister?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: There are two issues. First, let me make it clear  that the funds are not lost to Northern Ireland plc, as things stand. We can  seek the return of those funds, and they should be returned to Northern Ireland.  It will be up to the Executive to determine how they distribute end-year  flexibility when they get it.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, the Department of Health is a massive Department.  It receives half of the overall Budget for Northern Ireland, and it must  filter money to a series of organisations. Therefore, it faces massive  financial-planning issues. However, many people are waiting for hip  replacements or heart bypasses, for example, and they may have been told by the  professionals that the money is not available for their treatment. If they hear  today that there is a &pound;55 million underspend in the Health Department, they  will ask questions.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">It is the job of the financial planners in the Health  Department to ensure that they plan better to ensure that they use the money  that is allocated to them. Simply asking for more money achieves nothing if  they cannot use the money that has already been allocated.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. All Members will share the  concerns that the Minister has just outlined about departmental underspending  and the effects that that has on essential front-line services. I was glad to  hear his comments about Assembly Committees exercising a more proactive role in  scrutinising their respective Depart&shy;ments&rsquo; budgets, especially in the run-up  to monitoring rounds, where they can have an impact. Will the Minister comment  on any direct effect on front-line services to the public that resulted from  underspending in the Department of Finance and Personnel?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: By asking PEDU to examine one particular area of the  Department of Finance and Personnel&rsquo;s responsibility, I have indicated an area  in which I think that there can be improvements. It is probably unnecessary for  me to say more than that.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">As the Member will know, she and I could identify areas in  which improvements could be made in any Department. If Departments are handing  back money at the end of a financial year, we must ask why that money was not  used to improve the services that we give to the community. These are very  large sums. I recognise the difficulties that accounting officers and others  face in ensuring that the plans that are set out at the beginning of the year &mdash;  or, in some cases, three years in advance &mdash; are implemented.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">If our plans cannot be fulfilled, we must do better to  ensure that funds are reallocated to where they will be of use.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I accept the Member&rsquo;s point about the Committee for Finance  and Personnel. The target for the general level of underspend is about right &mdash;  Departments should aim for an underspend in the region of 1%. Other Governments  have achieved such levels of underspend; the Scottish Government, for example,  reached a 0&middot;1% underspend. I would be nervous about such a tight position, but  the example shows that underspend targets can be achieved, with proper  planning. We must raise our game to ensure that the public get a return for the  money that they hand over in payment of their rates bill.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: The  Finance Minister indicated that underspend figures are set against February&rsquo;s  final-plan position. Will he advise how Departments have performed against what  they were allocated at the start of the year?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I will be happy to provide the Member with a table  showing detailed figures for each Department. As I indicated to Dr Farry &mdash; Mr  Weir&rsquo;s fellow Member for North Down &mdash; overall, Departments fulfilled only 60%  of their intended capital expenditure, and about 95% of their resource or  revenue expenditure. If we have had to reallocate funds within departmental  in-year monitoring rounds, the underspend figure is really 5%, rather than 2%.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>:  In light of the Minister&rsquo;s response to Mr McCallister&rsquo;s question, does he not  accept that it is much more difficult to forecast revenue spend? For example, DEL&rsquo;s expenditure on  programmes is dependent on the decisions of individuals.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister rightly draws attention to his Department&rsquo;s  3&middot;1% underspend &mdash; the fourth highest of all the Departments. The Minister  conceded that his Department has some way to go before it can set an example  that others should follow. Will the Minister provide the House with some detail  on how &mdash; and when &mdash; his Department aims to achieve the Committee for Finance  and Personnel&rsquo;s target of 1% underspend?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I am not sure whether I have misinterpreted Mr  McCallister or whether the Member misspoke during his initial remarks. It is more  difficult to get close to zero underspend for capital than for revenue. Capital  expenditure is very difficult to predict because it is subject to so many  variables. Capital schemes are innovative by nature and, therefore, it is more  difficult to develop a curve showing the trajectory of capital expenditure.  Capital spend is often subject to the Planning Service, and the process is not always  as prompt as we would like. Capital expenditure can also be subject to legal,  roads and tendering issues. For example, tenders are often not within what we  are prepared to pay, and there has to be a re-tender.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Lots of things can go wrong in capital spend; revenue spend  is much more predictable. Therefore, we should be able to get closer to our  underspend target for revenue expenditure. That is not simply my general belief  &mdash; statistics prove that to be the case. Underspend figures for past years show  that capital underspend is significantly higher than revenue underspend.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Member&rsquo;s second question referred directly to the  Department of Finance and Personnel. The trajectory under direct rule indicated  a worsening situation in the Department of Finance and Personnel. The level of  underpsend increased from 7&middot;1% in 2004-05, to 9&middot;1% in 2005-06, to 10&middot;7% in  2006-07. The trajectory is going in the other direction and has been reduced to  3&middot;1%.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">With hard work, the position has been turned round. Far  from being critical of my officials, I recognise that they have reversed the  trend in my Department and been able to reduce the underspend.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Those figures relate only to current expenditure. With  respect to the capital budget, the underspend in 2004-05 was 88&middot;3%; in the  following year, it was 73&middot;4%; the year after that, it was 18&middot;3%; and now I have  reduced it to 4&middot;6%. Therefore, I take the applause from the Ulster Unionist  Benches for transforming the situation in the Department of Finance and  Personnel.</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I agree with the other Members who  have spoken. The public will not care about the reasons for the &pound;177 million  underspend, come the back of numerous debates in the Assembly.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In answer to a previous question, the Minister said that  the money would not be lost to the Executive with the passing of time. Can he  explain that to us? I believe that the money will be lost to Departments, for  it will be transferred to the central fund.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister believe that senior civil servants in all  Departments take their talents and experience with them when they move from one  Department to another? The permanent secretary of the Department of Health  previously worked for the Department of Finance and Personnel. Where did that  all go wrong?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: We could have a long debate about that last point.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Member is absolutely correct that as soon as there is  an underspend in any Department, the money is lost to it. The &pound;55 million  underspent in the Department of Health is lost to that Department. It will stay  in the Treasury. The Executive will have to bid for the return of all the money  underspent in this financial year from the Treasury. If we cannot persuade the  Treasury to release that money to settle the equal pay issue, I suspect that  the Treasury will want to spread the return of the money over a number of years.  As the money comes back to Northern    Ireland, the Executive can allocate it. The  Executive will receive bids from the Department of Health and from other  Departments. If a Department has an underspend, there is no guarantee that it  will get that money back. It will have to bid for it, as will every other  Department.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  After encouraging indications earlier in the year, and in the monitoring  rounds, of improved financial management in Departments, there has been a  deeply disappointing out-turn from some Depart&shy;ments. That makes a compelling  case for application of some of the sanctions described in the Minister&rsquo;s  statement. Will the Minister confirm to the House that he will consider making  senior civil servants ineligible for bonuses if their Departments continue to  underspend so badly?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I hinted earlier that the award of a bonus must  reflect good value given by an individual in his public service. If ensuring  that the public service fulfils the plans laid by the Executive is a key  objective, then it must be a factor in how well that person has performed. The  Member&rsquo;s suggestion that it should be the only factor and the whole bonus  should depend on it is draconian, but it is certainly one factor and,  therefore, the bonus should reflect to some extent the ability of the  accounting officer to meet the targets that have been set.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McQuillan</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. Has the impact of the Northern Ireland  Civil Service equal pay policy been factored into the underspend figures?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: It has not. The figures that I have outlined are the  provisional out-turns for the Departments based upon the allocations made to  them. The underspend of &pound;177 million leaves us with two arguments that might be  deployed against the Treasury. The first is that direct rule left us with the  problem of equal pay, and therefore, the United Kingdom Government should stump  up to remedy that. Secondly, if they are not prepared to do that then we should  be able to use some of the funds that were not spent to deal with the costs  that we will incur in back payments to meet equal pay requirements.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  There appears to be a significant difference of opinion between the Minister of  Finance and Personnel and others about whether capital expenditure or revenue  is the most difficult to forecast. I ask the Minister to demonstrate his  command of the detail and explain how in the Department for Employment and  Learning &mdash; which he mentioned &mdash; more than two-thirds of the original &pound;733  million produced an underspend of less than three-quarters of one per cent.  That position is highly acceptable. Does he agree that the underspend occurred  in demand-led areas, which are difficult to forecast?</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Does he also accept that planned overspend was reduced to  try and meet the budget? Does he consider that that reduction had an adverse  effect on the profile, which, I see from the chart, peaks at the end of the  financial year? Does he think that the party-political-bickering that we see,  in which one Department plays off another, is helpful as regards collective  responsibility? Will he explain to the people of Northern Ireland why the Minister  of Education appears to have a &pound;50 million underspend but cannot find money for  extended schools? That inconsistency can be applied to any Department. Why is  that being allowed to happen under our financial regulations?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Let me settle the issue, because it is not merely  about the Member&rsquo;s opinion or mine. There is statistical evidence, and the  statistics are fairly stubborn. The Member can put whatever excuses he wants  into the ether, but the figures show the reality. There are significantly  higher amounts of underspend in capital expenditure than there are in resource  expenditure.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Why is that?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I will inform the Member of the reasons again,  because I suspect that he needs to be told three times before he understands.  First, it is more difficult to predict capital expenditure because the projects  involved are often novel, one-off experiences. Departments are unable, therefore,  to benefit from a learning curve or by drawing on the knowledge of previous  capital expenditure projects. Secondly, capital expenditure relies on planning,  tendering, legal issues and a Department&rsquo;s ability to get workmen on and off  site in a given time.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In the 2007-08 financial year, there was an underspend of  2&middot;1% in resource expenditure and 6&middot;3% in capital expenditure. That should tell  the Member something &mdash; it should tell him that since the underspend of capital  expenditure is greater, it is more difficult for Departments to spend their  full capital expenditure allocation.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I do not look at out-turns as being a case of comparing one  Department with another, because I acknowledge what the Member for North Antrim  Mr O&rsquo;Loan said. Some Departments find it easier than others to use up money at  the end of the year, and the Department for Regional Development is such a  Department. Contrary to being party political, I commended the Department of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety on its capital expenditure. It was  able to return a low level of underspend.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">It is not right for Basil McCrea to point the finger at the  Minister of Education and accuse her of being a terrible Minister because &pound;4  million could not be found for a project although she had an underspend of &pound;50  million, while saying that his Minister had an underspend of &pound;55 million, which  is all right. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Please allow the Minister to respond.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I have been fair in distributing criticism where it  is due, and that criticism must be directed at departmental financial planners.  It is not the Minister of Education or the Minister of Health, Social Services  and Public Safety who carry out departmental financial planning &mdash; they crack  the whip and ask what the out-turn figures will be, and whether the Department  will meet its requirements. We have to be even-handed. No Department, with the  exception of DRD, has done well in its current expenditure underspend &mdash; I did  not notice that the Minister for Regional Development had just arrived. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Department for Regional Development was the only  Department that managed to get its spending within the target figures that were  set by the Department of Finance and Personnel.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>:  Several Members mentioned the debate on extended schools that took place in the  House. During that debate, the Minister of Education indicated that, on  numerous occasions, she had written to the Minister of Finance and Personnel to  request additional funding. Will the Minister of Finance and Personnel state  whether he responded to those requests?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I believe that, on four occasions, I responded to  requests that were made during the Executive-level discussions &mdash; I was going to  call them negotiations &mdash; that take place between Ministers. I met the Minister  of Education on many occasions, and she indicated the needs of, and her  aspirations for, the Department of Education. The money that was allocated to  that Department was increased as a result of each of our discussions. Indeed,  the Minister can point out that her Department had one of the highest levels of  increase in its budget. It seems that the Department of Education has more  money than it can use and will therefore have to reduce its underspend in the  next financial year or it will be one of the Departments whose future spending  patterns will have to be reviewed.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The Minister of Finance and  Personnel has made much of his call for efficiency, for funds to be directed  towards front-line services, and for an end to bureaucracy in our system. I support  that fully, as does my party. Does the Minister agree, therefore, that if we  are to curb the underspend in the Department of Education, we must achieve all  the aforementioned goals? Does he also agree that one way of doing that is to  establish the education and skills authority, as proposed by the Minister of  Education?</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, does the Minister agree that if that authority  were introduced, there would be a more-refined, leaner, keener machine that  would ensure that money is spent? That would also allow for capital-build  programmes to progress. I am aware of one of capital-build programme with an  allocated budget of &pound;21 million that has been delayed because of the bureaucratic  system within which we operate. Therefore, does the Minister of Finance and  Personnel agree that we must establish the education and skills authority and  start making changes in education?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I do not intend to get too involved in the policy  issue, but I remind the Member that, although there are always ways of doing  things cheaply, we must do things to the highest level in order to get the best  return. For instance, if there were three bodies rather than one education and  skills authority, it could be argued that that would allow a closer on-the-ground  scrutiny of what was going on, resulting in savings being made. However, the  financial outcome of such an undertaking is the kind of issue that we can leave  the economists and others to argue about.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">We must recognise that every Department provides services,  that those services must be provided in a way that offers the best value for  money and that, often, that way is not the cheapest option. We must get the  best value for money and cut out waste. It rattles me significantly that, at  the end of a financial year, we find ourselves with &pound;177 million unspent, while  members of the public want improved services and have been denied the services  that they desperately want and need. That is not a satisfactory situation, but  it should not provoke an argument among Members, because the only issue that we  should be concerned with is how to get a better return at the end of the next  financial year.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Rather than worrying about how much has been spent by any  one Department, we should be concerned about ensuring that the underspend is  reduced and that the ratepayers and taxpayers of Northern Ireland get the best value  for money.</p>
	        <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="2"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
	        <p class="H4StageHeading">North/South Ministerial Council Transport Sectoral  Meeting</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I have received notice from the Minister for Regional Development  that he wishes to make a statement regarding the North/South Ministerial  Council transport sectoral meeting.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development (Mr Murphy)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann  Comhairle. In compliance with section 52 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, I  wish to make the following report about the fifth meeting of the North/South  Ministerial Council (NMSC) in the transport sectoral format, which was held at  the T&iacute; Chulainn conference centre in Mullaghbane, County Armagh  on Wednesday 21 May 2008.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive were represented by Arlene Foster MLA and I,  and the Irish Government were represented by Noel Dempsey TD.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Environment Minister, Arlene Foster, has approved the  report, and I make it on her behalf.</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted and welcomed the progress that had been  made since the last meeting in December 2007 and the chance to meet to discuss  opportunities for cross-border co-operation on strategic transport planning and  road safety.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Council discussed the positions of the A5 north-west  gateway to Aughnacloy and A8 Belfast to Larne road projects, and noted the  progress that has been made. I advised the Council that the A5 project is on  target to achieve its first significant milestone &mdash; preliminary route corridor  assessment &mdash; by late 2008. It is anticipated that the preferred route will be  selected by mid-2009, and the draft statutory Orders published by late 2010.  Beyond that, it is anticipated that a public inquiry will be necessary. Subject  to satisfactory progress through the statutory procedures, construction could  commence by 2012 and be completed by 2015. The Council also noted that several  key milestones have been agreed, which can be aligned with the timing of  payments from the Irish Government.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">On the A8 project, I advised the Council that development  work is in progress on the proposal to provide 14 km of dual carriageway  between Belfast  and Larne. I confirmed that that project is also on target to achieve the first  significant milestone of preliminary route corridor assessment later this year.  Overall delivery is anticipated on a similar timescale to the A5 project.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted and welcomed the continuing progress on  the Irish Government&rsquo;s proposals to replace the two cross-border bridges at  Annaghroe and Knocknaginny on the Tyrone/Monaghan border. Monaghan County  Council has appointed consultants to develop the design, and information  evenings for the public were held in County  Tyrone and County Monaghan  in March. The issue of full community consultation on the proposals before the  bridges open was raised by the Environment Minister and discussed. A further  opportunity for public consultation will arise when the bridge design proposals  are submitted for planning approval. The Council welcomed that progress and  commended the excellent cross-border co-operation to date at official level.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted that Louth County Council has appointed  consultants who have begun a technical study on the construction of a bridge at  Narrow Water &mdash; public consultation took place recently in Louth and  Warrenpoint. The technical study, environmental impact statement and  preliminary design work will be completed by the end of 2008.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I reminded the Council that Roads Service has employed  consultants who have undertaken a feasibility study for a Newry southern relief  road, which would link the A2    Warrenpoint Road to the A1 just south of Newry.  That study is also due to be completed later this year, and further reports on  both projects will be presented to future NSMC transport sectoral meetings. The  Council welcomed the close co-operation between officials on those projects,  which it looked forward to continuing as the work on both studies progresses.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Council reviewed the progress since the last meeting on  proposals for improving the Belfast to Dublin rail service. It  noted that the two railway companies have considered options for redeploying  additional existing rolling stock on the Belfast  to Dublin line,  which could improve the frequency of the service. Both railway companies are  finalising proposals in the form of a costed business case, which will be  presented prior to the next NSMC meeting in transport sectoral format.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Council welcomed the commitment from the Department for  Regional Development to improve the railway line from Belfast  to Derry. Ministers noted that the Department  for Regional Development has agreed to undertake a study to consider the  long-term social, physical and economic redevelopment of the railway throughout  the north-west. Once the study is complete, its findings will be brought to a  meeting of the NSMC in transport sectoral format, at which stage consideration  will be given to a study of improved public-transport links with Donegal.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted that City of Derry Airport had begun work  on the runway safety improvement scheme, which is supported by &pound;14 million of  funding from the two Governments. Already, over &pound;3 million of grants has been  paid to Derry City Council. As a precondition of the grant scheme, Derry City  Council is required to commit to a programme of reform for the governance of  the airport. The Council noted that a commitment had been given to incorporate  the airport into a company wholly owned by the local authority, followed,  within an 18-month period, by the sale of the company, either outright or with  Derry City Council retaining control of the airport land through a long-term  lease. The Council noted that, in addition to the grant aid scheme, Derry City  Council has funded the construction of a new taxiway and extended the aircraft  parking apron.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted the progress that is being made in  reducing road deaths by the authorities on both sides of the border. It  welcomed the continuing co-operation between the authorities on advertising,  publicity and road safety in border areas and noted the potential for further  liaison on key road-safety issues, such as drink-driving limits, road-safety  strategies and cross-border enforcement. Ministers also requested an  intensification in the work on a bilateral agreement on the EU Convention on  Driving Disqualifications to ensure that it is brought into effect by late 2008  or early 2009.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted that preparations are under way for a  cross-border rural community transport project, which is expected to commence  before the end of 2008. That project will involve community transport groups in  the Fermanagh and Cavan border region. A report on the evaluation of the pilot  scheme will be presented to a future NSMC meeting in transport sectoral format.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Council discussed sustainable transport, and noted that  the Department of Transport has launched a paper entitled &lsquo;2020 Vision &mdash;  Sustainable Travel and Transport&rsquo; for public consultation. The Council also  noted that a number of initiatives on sustainable transport are being  progressed by the Department for Regional Development.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted that officials met to share information  and experience and to explore measures to promote sustainable transport. It  looked forward to receiving specific cross-border pilot projects on sustainable  transport for consideration at future NSMC meetings in transport sectoral  format.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted the ongoing work and studies being  undertaken on rapid transit in Belfast, Cork, Limerick, Waterford  and Galway. It welcomed the ongoing  discussions among officials about sharing information and co-operation on that  issue.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers welcomed the presentation from the Confederation  of British Industry/Irish Business and Employers Confederation Joint Business  Council on the findings of the report &lsquo;Freight Transport Report for the Island of Ireland&rsquo;. Ministers agreed that  officials should consider the recommendations of the study that are relevant to  the NSMC transport area and should report to a future meeting.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Council agreed to meet again in October or November  2008. Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Regional Development (Mr Cobain)</strong>: I thank the Minister  for his statement.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Is the real problem with the Belfast  to Dublin rail  service not related to the trackbed, rather than rolling stock? Unless work to  the trackbed is conducted, there is little point in spending money on faster  trains, which will not be able to run at full speed. That has been a problem  with the Belfast  to Derry/Londonderry line. I am sure that, like us, the Minister does not want  to see such problems repeated on the Belfast to Dublin line.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The Chairman is correct to say that we need to  improve the service and the system of rail network across the North and across  the island generally. Of course we want to improve the Belfast  to Dublin  railway line. That not only involves investment in the rolling stock, but  investment in the track itself. There are a number of problems with the track  between Belfast and Dublin that cause the service to be slower  than we would like.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The general objectives are to provide more a frequent,  faster and more comfortable service. In doing so, we hope to improve the usage  of the service. One study that we considered recently estimated that, within 30  years, 40% of the population of Ireland  will live on the eastern corridor between Belfast  and Dublin.  Such a statistic could be used to argue for investment in the rail network  along that corridor, both locally and on the intercity network.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and NIR (Northern Ireland Railways) are  preparing a business case to present to a NSMC meeting that will outline a  range of options and associated costings about how to improve across a range of  areas, including frequency, speed and comfort. We have asked for that report to  be delivered to us in advance of the next NSMC meeting, which will enable us to  consider and discuss the options, rather than simply receive them at that  meeting. I look forward to receiving that, and to the continued support for  increased investment in rail from the Committee for Regional Development and  the Assembly generally.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  Does the Minister recall that, just before he took high office, he, I and all  the Assembly Members for South Down and Newry and Armagh signed a document in  Newry stating that a southern relief road was essential to relieve congestion  in that city? If so, does he believe that that is still the case?</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister stated that negotiations are ongoing for a  bridge at Narrow Water, near Warrenpoint. Will he offer an assurance that,  should that project proceed, it will in no way prejudice the prospect of having  a southern relief road that is required for South Down and Newry and Armagh? Such a road will relieve the chronic congestion  that is currently strangling Newry.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I have no difficulty in standing over what I signed  up to. I believe that there is an urgent need for a connection between the port of Warrenpoint  and the M1 motorway between Belfast and Dublin. Such a connection  is essential for the port and its continued expansion, and for the southern  part of Newry into South Down to relieve traffic congestion.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Despite what the Member might like, I will not fall into  the trap of saying that those projects are in competition with each other. Even  before I assumed what he referred to as &ldquo;high office&rdquo;, I always avoided the  notion that the Narrow Water bridge project was competing with the southern  relief road project.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Louth County Council is currently conducting a study in  relation to the Narrow Water bridge project, and the Roads Service is  conducting one in relation to the southern relief road. Officials from both of  those projects are sharing information with one another, and both studies are  expected to be completed by the end of this year. They will then be put before  the next NSMC meeting, and we will see where that takes us. I am committed to  trying to reduce the traffic congestion on the southern side of Newry. I am  also committed to improving the access to Warrenpoint port because that is an  essential economic driver for that region. I have also expressed my support for  the idea of a bridge linking the communities in County  Louth and County Down.  We will consider what the two studies produce, and we will see where that takes  us.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Will the Minister outline what  progress has been made in relation to sustainable transport on an all-island  basis? Will he also outline what initiatives are being progressed by the  Department regarding sustainable transport?</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">With your indulgence, a LeasCheann Comhairle, I also ask  the Minister whether the issue of public transport using biofuels was discussed  at the NSMC meeting.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I will answer the Member&rsquo;s final question first &mdash; it  was not. However, that is not to say that that issue could not feature on the  agenda of a future NSMC meeting.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Sustainable transport is something that is very important  to us. I strongly feel that there is an all-Ireland dimension to travel, and I  support the need to deepen cross-border co-operation to address sustainability  issues and meet the challenges that lie ahead.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">At a time when the amount of traffic on roads continues to  increase, we need to work together and contribute to CO2 reductions by seeking  opportunities to address congestion and encourage more environmentally friendly  travel. Officials, North and South, have met to share information and  experience, and to explore measures to promote sustainable transport. I am keen  that behavioural-change projects that are already in place in the North &mdash; such  as the promotion of walking, cycling, public transport, car sharing and  park-and-ride facilities &mdash; could assist the South in the development of its  sustainable travel and transport action plan.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The meeting noted plans to jointly undertake pilot  demonstration projects and studies that will lead to more sustainable travel on  both sides of the border. At a future meeting, we look forward to hearing the  results of how those projects could be expanded further for the mutual benefit  of both North and South.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement this morning. I also welcome the report on  the ongoing efforts to improve the Dublin to Belfast rail link. Both  Governments must continue the work to upgrade that very important track,  because, until we receive a fully recognised Euro rail link, that is a target  that both Governments should aim for.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I imagine that the Minister expects me to raise a question  about Narrow Water, so I will not disappoint him. I welcome the fact that the  project was profiled at the meeting on 21 May 2008. The report gives me  encouragement, and I welcome the response that the Minister gave to Mr Wells.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">At the last meeting that I had with officials in the  Republic, I was given nine indicative dates. As the Minister mentioned, two of  those have already passed. However, the dates that I was given included 28  February 2010, which is the date for the tendering process; and August 2011,  which is the date for the completion of the work. Will the Minister assure me &mdash;  and others who will benefit greatly from the provision of the bridge &mdash; that he  will work to achieve those stages by those dates, or even advance them if  possible?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Due to his keen interest in that project, the Member  will be aware that the study was undertaken by Louth County Council; it was not  done by the Department for Regional Development. The dates that he mentioned  were shared with him by those who conducted the study on behalf of Louth County  Council.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I have read further press announcements in relation to that  project. I often think that Narrow Water bridge would have been built a long  time ago if it were built on press releases. Nonetheless, we are where we are  with that project. In one of the Member&rsquo;s press releases, I also note that he  said that DRD was not doing enough to assist that project. DRD has not been  asked to do anything by the people conducting the study. I asked Roads Service  officials to share information with the people conducting the study on behalf  of Louth County Council.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">My answer remains the same as it was to Mr Wells; let the  studies be completed and then we will see what propositions are put to us. We  will certainly respond as positively as we possibly can.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>: I  am delighted that the issue of the A8 Larne to Belfast road was discussed at the meeting,  and the fact that public consultations are ongoing currently. Will the Minister  indicate what the estimated timescale is for the completion of that project?</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: As I said in my statement, the first milestone will  be to identify the route corridor, which will happen shortly. As the Member  knows, that will go out for consultation, and we will then have to identify the  preferred route option. Unfortunately, those processes take time, because a  proper assessment of, and consultation on, all the routes is required. Whatever  route is suggested, as with any significant road project, a public inquiry will  be inevitable, because people will object to some aspect, be it their access to  the road or the impact that that will have on people&rsquo;s property or land; that  will take time. However, the process is expected to follow the same timescale  as the A5 Derry to Aughnacloy route, with commencement by 2012 and completion  by 2015.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Moutray</strong>:  Given that journey times on the Belfast to Dublin rail link are often more than  two and a half hours and, indeed, in the past, have taken as long as five  hours, what analysis has been undertaken to assess the effectiveness of the  Minister&rsquo;s efforts to improve the efficiency of the service?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: We strive constantly to improve efficiency. However,  bad experiences are heard more often than good, normal, run-of-the-mill  experiences. Several parts of the line have been identified that slow down the  journey, one of which is between Lurgan and Lisburn. Access into Connolly  station on the Dublin  side is an issue because of congestion with the local intercity service.  Several issues have been identified.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">At the previous NSMC meeting, we had a presentation from  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Northern Ireland Railways. We had hoped that the business  case that we had requested would be presented at the Mullaghbawn meeting, but  that did not happen because it required more work. However, we have asked for the  business case to be presented to us in advance of the next NSMC meeting so that  some analysis can be conducted, and we can respond at that meeting. We want to  improve the service &mdash; frequency, speed and comfort &mdash; and thereby increase the  number of passengers who use the service. It is hoped that the business case  will identify a range of options and the attendant costings, and we will then  have to find the resources. However, the business case will identify what must  be done, and at what level, to improve the service. The improvement of the  service is the constant goal of the Department and NIR.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Given the fact that there will be a  report on the community-based rural transport pilot scheme in the Fermanagh/Cavan  area, have there been any discussions to extend that scheme, if successful,  into other border areas?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The fact that community-based rural transport is  considered a pilot scheme suggests that we anticipate and hope that it will be  successful.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">A range of issues has been identified about difficulties in  the provision of cross-border rural transport. The pilot scheme is focusing on  identifying the potential demands and barriers, which include logistic,  legislative and procedural issues, for the provision of cross-border rural  transport. We hope that the operation of the scheme between Fermanagh and Cavan  will identify the obstacles.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">We are reasonably sure of some of the obstacles, but pilot  schemes are effective in examining how schemes work and what inhibits their  full and proper working. We intend to address whatever difficulties are thrown  up as a result of the pilot scheme and to use that experience to introduce  other schemes that will benefit from learning about the obstacles that were  faced and overcome in the pilot scheme. The intention is to use that experience  to roll out schemes in other cross-border areas.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  In his statement, the Minister referred to the bridges on the Tyrone/Monagahan  border. Although they are not in my constituency, will the Minister assure the  Assembly that full public consultation will be undertaken at every stage of the  process, particularly on the design of the bridges at Annaghroe and  Knocknaginney?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Yes, the bridges were discussed at the meeting, and  the Minister of the Environment raised the specific concerns of the local  community on the re-opening of the roads. Undoubtedly, when roads have been  closed for a lengthy period, their re-opening will create some disturbance in  that area. Minister Foster asked Minister Dempsey to talk to Monaghan County  Council to ensure that whatever further consultation the communities in that  border area deem necessary will be fully undertaken.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">A quantity of information has been distributed, but some  people felt that they did not have a full opportunity to examine, and express  their views on, the proposals. However, Minister Dempsey assured us that  Monaghan County Council will ensure full consultation with local people at each  stage of the process and, if people want additional information, the council  will accommodate them.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  This morning, I am reassured that, should the projects for a bridge at Narrow  Water and a southern relief road end up competing on budgetary terms, at least  the Minister has signed up to the latter and has pledged to honour that  commitment.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister accepts that there has been widespread local  opposition, on both sides of the border, to the bridges linking Tyrone and  Monaghan. Will he do everything in his power to address the issues that have  been raised on each side of the border? Will he agree to review whether the  project should even proceed?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The Southern Government would fund the project for a  bridge at Narrow Water, and it would be up to the Assembly to fund the southern  relief road project, if it were to go ahead. The only chance of the projects  competing for a budgetary allocation would be in a united Ireland, in  which everyone would share the same Budget. I look forward to the day when such  projects compete for funding from the same pool of money.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The bridges were discussed at the meeting, and it was  accepted that the re-opening of roads after a lengthy closure would cause some  disruption and alter the pattern of people&rsquo;s lives that has been established  over the past 30 years, or for however long the bridges have been closed. The  Minister of the Environment raised the issue, and it was acknowledged that  people &mdash; certainly on the Northern side &mdash; want more consultation. They want to  examine the proposals more fully and be given an opportunity to comment on  them. The Southern representatives undertook to speak to Monaghan County  Council about facilitating that.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  I too welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement, particularly on road safety. Members  are constantly concerned about the continued carnage on the roads, such as  occurred in Donegal, only last weekend. A move to a metric system would be of  particular benefit to tourists travelling in the border regions. Does the  Minister foresee a time of greater harmonisation of road signage?</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has committed to improving the Derry to Belfast railway line. An  independent study by the Northern Corridor Railways Group clearly demonstrates  that the sustainability of the line is crucial to the long-term economic,  social and environmental stability of the area. When will the Minister  introduce definitive proposals on the future of the line from Derry to Belfast?</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister referred to a study on a rail link in the  north-west. Is that time-bound? Will he use the proposals by the Northern  Corridor Railways Group, in conjunction with the Irish Government&rsquo;s study on  Donegal, as a template for going forward?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The Northern Corridors Railways Group produced its  study. It then asked my Department to initiate a study into the social and  economic benefits of developing the railway line between Belfast  and Derry, and links to the north-west in  general. We have agreed to do that, and we will undertake that study as soon as  is possible. The Member will be aware that significant investment is already  being made between Coleraine and Derry. More  work is about to begin, and work has been proposed for the coming years. I  identified, and bid for, a &pound;64 million improvement to the track between  Coleraine and Derry. That all augurs well for  the future of that line.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The study will undoubtedly help, because, as was the case  with the Belfast to Dublin line, and our railways in general, we  must increasingly make stronger arguments for investment in rail  infrastructure, as the population, congestion and pressure on our roads grows.  We must return to a system of investing more in our railways. I look forward to  the completion of the study to which we have committed. We have also committed  to bringing that study to the NSMC, and to using it to kick-start and influence  a study into public transport in Donegal that examines how both systems might  link up. We are committed to doing that at future NSMC meetings.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Member asked about road signage. An examination of each  and every area in which road safety can be improved will take place. The  objective is to try to reduce the number of deaths on our roads. Particular  problems exist in border areas, but whether accidents occur because of road  signs or because of driver behaviour, which, unfortunately, most deaths on the  road are as a result of, is another matter.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister of the Environment takes lead responsibility  for developing the road safety policy. My Department will contribute to that  policy, and we will happily consider improved signage if it were identified as  something that would help.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  statement. Does he agree that there has been substantial progress on North to  South road infrastructure, in particular the M1 from Dublin  to Belfast and the M2 from Belfast  to Derry?</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Given its congestion and traffic problems, did any discussion  take place on the third main arterial route, which, in part, connects  Castleblayney, Keady and Armagh? Given that  70% of road fatalities happen on rural roads, and in the border counties, will  the Minister update us on any relevant new measures to reduce that statistic?  Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Other Members may dispute whether the road through  Keady is the third main route. Quite a few people have suggested that the Sligo  to Belfast  route &mdash; the N4 &mdash; is one of the main routes, North and South.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">To answer the Member&rsquo;s question directly, the matter was  not discussed. However, roads projects that cross the border are issues that  feature on NSMC agendas. If a particular issue arises, or a case is made for  improving that road, I am sure that it will appear on our agenda at some stage.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">A range of road safety issues was discussed, one of which  concerned mutual recognition. There was a sense that the urgency in dealing  with mutual recognition of disqualifications, and in sharing information across  the border, should be stepped up. Of course, a range of measures to deal with  road safety is already in place. At the previous NSMC meeting, we saw a  presentation of the Southern Government&rsquo;s road safety policy. I know that the Minister  of the Environment is intending to review the road safety policy here, and to  make known her findings in 2010. That, of course, does not prevent the  introduction of interim road safety measures, such as advertising, road  improvements, education measures, detection, disqualification, and harsher  penalties for people who are caught speeding or driving irresponsibly.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">All those measures are being undertaken as it is, but a  review of the road safety strategy will also take place. A strategy is  currently being introduced in the South. That will provide opportunities,  particularly in border areas, where it is recognised that there is a particular  problem. Statistics show that there is dispropor&shy;tionate number of accidents  and deaths compared with some of the other counties across the island.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Sharing information on both strategies will help Ministers  to devise further strategies on top of those that already work in order to  reduce the carnage further. Bearing in mind that serious accidents have  occurred during the past few weeks, with bank holidays in the North and South &mdash;  which, tragically, always seems to be the case &mdash; generally speaking, statistics  for the time of year are down, both North and South, compared with previous  years. We hope that that remains the case and that those figures can be driven  down further.</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">12.00 noon</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. He referred to improvements that have  been made to the southern relief road. As regards tourist traffic, 100,000  extra tourists have come to Northern Ireland  in the past year, and it is quite clear that a large number of them are from  the Republic of Ireland. Are steps being taken, not only  to improve the southern relief road at Warrenpoint, but to provide a bypass or  similar road improvements at Ballynahinch and, indeed, at Downpatrick, which  will, ultimately, open the door towards Strangford? That is my idea. I am sure  that the Minister would be disappointed if I were not to mention Strangford at  some stage.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">My other question relates to the bilateral agreement on  driving disqualifications. Has any progress been made between the Republic of Ireland  and Northern Ireland  on the issue of disqualified drivers? Many in the Chamber believe that it is  important that, when someone is disqualified from driving in the Republic of Ireland  or Northern Ireland,  the same rule applies in the other jurisdiction. I want confirmation on whether  progress is ongoing on that issue.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The Ballynahinch bypass is identified in Roads  Service&rsquo;s forward planning schedule. I am not sure about a bypass for  Downpatrick. I met some of Downpatrick&rsquo;s councillors to discuss the traffic  through the town and improvements that could be made, and we identified some  options by which the flow of traffic through Downpatrick could be assisted.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, increased tourism brings increased traffic. On  one hand, increased tourism is a welcome development. However, it brings  associated problems. I am sure that many tourists who come to the North will  want to visit Strangford Lough and to see the beauty of that area. So, a bypass  for Ballynahinch has been identified. The Department will continue to work to  improve road networks away from major, key roads, on which there is already a  high degree of focus.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">As regards the mutual recognition of driving  disqualifications, there was, as I have said, a sense during the discussion  that the matter is largely between the Minister of the Environment and Minister  Dempsey. Certainly, there was a sense that both Ministers wanted some urgency  to be injected into discussion on the issue and that they felt that progress  has not been made as quickly as, perhaps, it could be. The matter has been the  subject of constraints that are associated with the normal processes of policy  development and implementation, including public consultation in both  jurisdictions. I understand that several technical and legal difficulties have  also been encountered. Mutual recognition of penalty points has also proven to  be a complex and difficult issue. It is expected to be some time yet before all  the obstacles to implementation can be overcome.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">A trilateral meeting on mutual recognition between the  Environment Minister and her counterparts in London  and Dublin is scheduled to take place in Belfast in June.  Certainly, the sense that I got from the meeting was that both Minister Foster  and Minister Dempsey wanted some urgency to be injected into the issue.  Technical and legal difficulties always occur with cross-border issues.  However, my sense of the discussion is that those difficulties are not  insurmountable. Ministers want to move ahead and close that loophole as early  as possible. A trilateral discussion is scheduled to take place in Belfast later in the  month to try to make progress on the issue. London&rsquo;s input is a key element in that  discussion.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  statement and the answers that he has already given. I note that the meeting  took place in T&iacute; Chulainn. I hope that the Minister showed a good example to  the Environment Minister by, at least, cycling, if not walking, to T&iacute; Chulainn  on that particular day.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  Does the Member suggest that I should have walked to T&iacute; Chulainn from  Fermanagh? <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  No, I meant that the Minister for Regional Development should have shown the  Environment Minister such a good example.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the study that has been carried out on the  redevelopment of railways in the north-west. What discussion on rapid transit  has the Minister had with his counterpart in the South? What discussions have  taken place between officials in both Departments?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Minister, did you cycle?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I have to confess, a LeasCheann Comhairle, that I did  not. Anyone who knows Sturgan Brae, which comes out of Camlough, heading  towards Crossmaglen, will understand that it would require more than my legs to  get up it on a bicycle.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I take on board the Member&rsquo;s point about sustainable  transport. Dublin has experienced the Luas rapid  transit system, and several other cities across the South, including Waterford, Limerick and Galway,  are considering rapid transit propositions. We were able to share with, and  hand over to, Minister Dempsey the outcome of the feasibility study that was  carried out on Belfast.  We provided the highlights of that study, which was welcome to his Department,  given that those other cities are being considered.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">On 15 May 2008, my officials made a presentation on the  findings and recommendations of our feasibility report to colleagues in Dublin, and they agreed  to continue the discussions as the project progresses. I understand that the  Southern Government are considering the feasibility of bus-based rapid  transport systems for Cork, Limerick, Galway and  Waterford.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. F&aacute;ilt&iacute;m roimh r&aacute;iteas an  Aire, agus gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis as. Is maith liom go raibh an cruinni&uacute; ar si&uacute;l  i dT&iacute; Chulainn, n&oacute; t&aacute; m&eacute; f&eacute;in ar dhuine d&aacute; bhunaitheoir&iacute;. Is maith go bhfuil an  Chomhairle Aireachta Thuaidh/Theas ag baint &uacute;s&aacute;ide as &aacute;iseanna pobail. Ba  mhaith liom fosta tagairt &aacute;irithe a dh&eacute;anamh don bh&oacute;thar faoisimh &oacute; dheas &oacute; I&uacute;r  Cinn Tr&aacute;, n&oacute; beidh r&oacute;l t&aacute;bhachtach ag an bh&oacute;thar sin ag fuascailt fadhbanna  tr&aacute;chta an I&uacute;ir.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister for his statement, and I welcome it. I  welcome the fact that the meeting was held in T&iacute; Chulainn, as I am one of the  founders of that centre. I am glad that the NSMC is making use of community  facilities.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The southern relief road in Newry will have an important  role in solving the traffic chaos in Newry. The Minister said that further  reports on the feasibility of the southern relief road will be presented to the  NSMC later this year. Will he ensure that the study, in addition to examining  the benefit to Newry city and south Down, will consider the potential benefit  to both jurisdictions in that the road will facilitate better links between  Warrenpoint port and Dublin  port? Will he ensure that the study considers the fact that Warrenpoint handles  a considerable volume of port traffic that Dublin port cannot presently handle? Go raibh  maith agat.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I was delighted to host the meeting in T&iacute; Chulainn,  and it is beneficial that, where possible, Government business, particularly  North/South meetings, makes use of community facilities, which rely on that  business more than some of the other venues that have been used. It is a good  venue, and all who came to it got a real sense of the beauty of the south Armagh area and were made welcome, which was also  beneficial.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I notice that the Member&rsquo;s namesake and colleague Mr P J  Bradley has left the Chamber. It is similar to a Punch-and-Judy act; one Member  supports the southern relief road and the other tries to harangue me over the  southern relief road and supports the construction of a bridge at Narrow Water.  Nonetheless, all politics is local, and even parties are able to divide along  local lines on such projects.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The idea of a southern relief road is important not only  for the port of Warrenpoint  and for the southern side of Newry but for the connection onto the A1/M1 north,  which will make a connection towards Dublin  and the other ports. Warrenpoint has a key role, and we have one eye on the  issues of port traffic generally on the eastern side of the island.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Dublin  has capacity issues, and there are, perhaps, development plans for the ports at  Greenore and Braemore. The ports at Warrenpoint, Belfast and Larne are all well placed to try  to enhance, and share, business with other ports. From my attendance at a  couple of ports conferences, I have noticed an increase in co-operation among  the ports across the island, and I am encouraged by that co-operation.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Warrenpoint port is important strategically to the region  that the Member and I represent and to the eastern seaboard generally, and I am  fully aware that a link road between the Warrenpoint-to-Newry dual carriageway  and the main Belfast-to-Dublin  road would be hugely important to the port and its ability to do business both  North and South.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> Last week, members of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure were  presented with a beautiful orange badge on which the word &ldquo;T&aacute;&rdquo; was written. I  understand that t&aacute; means &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, and, therefore, I am doing my bit to promote  the Irish language.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s detailed report, but I am  disappointed that, as yet, there has been no mention of the anomaly between  North and South on concessionary fares for people aged 60 and over. As usual,  the North led the way for people aged 60 and over. Given that we have friends  and relatives over the border, will the Minister pursue equality for everyone  on the island, so that everyone aged 60 and over &mdash; rather than over 66, as it  is across the border &mdash; can avail themselves of free public transport as soon as  possible?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his commentary and use of  Irish. He raised several issues. First, there was an anomaly anyway &mdash; even when  the concessionary fares applied to people aged 65 and over &mdash; because the  South&rsquo;s concessionary fares applied to people aged 66 and over. Therefore,  there was already a one-year anomaly. Given our intention to reduce the  concessionary-fare age limit to 60 in the autumn, an even greater gap will be  created between here and the South.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I must point out that the policy in the South is the  responsibility of the Department of Social and Family Affairs and not the  Department of Transport. Therefore, the North/South Ministerial Council  transport sectoral meeting was not the occasion on which to discuss such a  matter. Obviously, although reducing the age for eligibility to the  concessionary-fares scheme from 66 to 60 would have financial implications for  the Government in Dublin,  I, and people aged 60 and over throughout the island, would welcome such a  policy. However, in the first instance, it is a matter for the Irish  Government. Nevertheless, I am content to raise the matter in order to achieve  some degree of harmonisation. As I said, there are budgetary implications for  the South, and, in the final analysis, it will be a matter for them to decide.</p>
	        <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="3"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
	        <p class="H4StageHeading">Progress Report on the Independent Review into the Outbreak  of Clostridium Difficile at Antrim   Area Hospital</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I have received notice from the Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety that he wishes to give a progress report on the  independent review into the outbreak of clostridium difficile at Antrim Area   Hospital.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: I shall update  the Assembly on the independent review&rsquo;s progress on the outbreak of  clostridium difficile in the Northern Health and Social Care Trust.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">During the debate on 4 March 2008, I said that the  situation required an urgent response and immediate action. My first priority  was to ensure that the outbreak was contained and that other health and social  care trusts were taking all possible steps to minimise the risk of clostridium  difficile outbreaks in their hospitals. I announced that I had asked the  Regulation and Quality Improvement Authority (RQIA) not just to carry out an  independent review into the circumstances of the outbreak in the Northern  Health and Social Care Trust but to examine the measures being taken by all  trusts to reduce healthcare-associated infections.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I set terms of reference to ensure that the review would be  rigorous and would have all the powers and expertise necessary to investigate  the outbreak thoroughly and examine all five trusts&rsquo; management of, and  clinical response to, clostridium difficile infections. It was important for  the review to be conducted quickly, and I asked the independent review team to  report to me on its findings by the end of May.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I have now received the review team&rsquo;s interim report. The  report is, of necessity, interim because the outbreak has not been declared  over. From the outset, I have made it clear that the review will be conducted  in such a way as not to hamper staff&rsquo;s efforts to contain the outbreak.</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 am</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Over the past 12 weeks, the RQIA team has made substantial  progress on its independent review. On 30 May, members of the review team  reported to me in person, and I received the team&rsquo;s written report on 1 June.  To date, the team has completed its investigation into the other four trusts&rsquo;  actions to reduce clostridium difficile rates. The team has also gathered  substantial documentary evidence from the Northern Health and Social Care  Trust, and it carried out a validation visit on 30 May. Further important work  must be carried out before the RQIA can deliver its final report, and I will  return to that matter.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I met members of the review team on 30 May, and they  commented on the tremendous dedication of all staff in the Northern Health and  Social Care Trust and their efforts to contain the outbreak. They acknowledge  the immense pressure that staff have been under. I witnessed that dedication  when I visited the trust, and I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to  the staff. They have worked tirelessly, under extremely demanding conditions,  to bring the outbreak to an end. Members should also be reassured to hear that  the management of the outbreak is being taken very seriously by everyone in the  trust, from the chairperson and the chief executive right down to the cleaners  who work on the wards. People at all levels are working hard to ensure that  infection control is given the highest priority. The RQIA team has also  commented that the chief executive and the medical director of the trust &mdash;  indeed all the staff &mdash; have been very open.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased to report that there is evidence of progress  in containing the outbreak. The month of May saw the lowest number of cases of  any month this year, and the severity of the illness has eased. It is still too  early to say that the outbreak is over; that improvement must be sustained. To  that end, a team is being set up to ensure that policies, procedures and  practices for healthcare-associated infections are fully embedded across the  trust area. We will continue to monitor the position until we are sure that the  measures being taken by the trust are really working and that the outbreak is  over.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The independent review team&rsquo;s report is wide-ranging and  important. It makes 36 recommendations that cover four key areas: governance;  infection control; laboratories; and pharmacy. Overall, the team has reported  that all health and social care trusts have made good progress towards the  implementation of effective control measures to reduce the risk of clostridium  difficile infections.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The team has given the reassurance that all five health and  social care trusts recognise the need to prioritise actions to minimise  healthcare-associated infections in general and clostridium difficile in  particular. It has further reassured that all the trusts are working to achieve  the target that I set last year of an overall reduction of 20% in the number of  clostridium difficile cases in hospital patients aged 65 and over by March  2009, and to introduce a programme of action to ensure that plans and  procedures are in place, in line with recommended guidance, to reduce the rate  of clostridium difficile. In addition, the team points to the skilled and  committed staff who are working in infection-control teams in laboratories and  pharmacies. The team also highlighted many examples of creative local  initiatives to prevent and control infection, and good working relationships  between all those involved in infection-control measures across the trusts and  boards.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">As one would expect, there are challenges for the trusts.  In particular, the RQIA recognises that the five trusts were established  recently, and, as is normal when dealing with the merging of any complex  organisation, they are busy managing the detail of the mergers, including the  harmonisation of policies, procedures and practices. The review team identified  shortfalls in staffing levels in key professional groups, such as  microbiologists, antibiotic pharmacists and infection-control nurses. The team  also commented on a wide variation in the quality and condition of hospital  facilities, which reflects the age of some of the buildings. In addition, it  recommended improvements in the IT systems that support infection prevention  and control, especially for surveillance and antimicrobial resistance. The  review team comprises leading experts in the fields of clostridium difficile  and healthcare-associated infections.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I will now consider the report in more depth, and will take  seriously its recommendations and findings. Some issues will need to be  addressed more urgently than others, and my Department, and health and social  care organisations, will give those priority.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">We have not been standing still while awaiting the report.  The Department has worked with the Northern Health and Social Care Trust at  every step in order to support its efforts. We agreed recently that there would  be value in bringing in more external expertise. To that end, we have enlisted  the support of the National Health Service&rsquo;s cleaner-hospitals team. The team  visited the Northern Health and Social Care Trust on 7 May 2008 and set about  identifying areas for improvement, and making recommendations to help to bring  the situation under control.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The trust has established an action plan in order to address  the issues that have been raised, and the cleaner-hospitals team will return to  the trust on 4 June 2008 to see how well the plan is working. A member of the  team will join my Department&rsquo;s service delivery unit for two days a week for  the next few months. Their role will be further to assist the Northern Health  and Social Care Trust to end the outbreak, and to work with other trusts to  improve infection prevention and control.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">We will never be able to eradicate healthcare-associated  infections. However, there must be sufficient controls and systems to minimise  the risk to patients. That is why I announced in January an extensive range of  measures to tackle the so-called hospital superbugs. An additional &pound;9 million  will be invested over the next three years to improve patient safety and to  reduce the spread of infections such as MRSA and clostridium difficile.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">New initiatives to tackle healthcare-associated infections  include single rooms for new hospitals in order to improve hygiene and privacy;  a rolling programme, which is under way, of unannounced hygiene inspections of  all hospitals; restrictions on hospital visits, which I announced this morning;  a dress code for healthcare staff, which is being introduced; a regional  hand-hygiene campaign to encourage healthcare staff and visitors to wash their  hands; MRSA screening for high-risk patients; additional funding to set up  rapid-response cleaning teams at all hospitals; and funding for a pharmacist in  each trust area to work with clinical staff to promote safer prescribing of  antibiotics.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">There are policies already in place to tackle  healthcare-associated infections including the Changing the Culture action plan  and the ward sister&rsquo;s charter, which aim to reduce infections and to give  nurses the power to create a cleanliness culture in their wards. My Department  is also convening a committee to tackle the problem of antimicrobial  resistance.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, last September, I announced new targets to  reduce MRSA by 10% and clostridium difficile by 20%. New leaflets for the  public on hand hygiene have been distributed to hospitals. Enhanced staff  training on infection reduction is ongoing, and extra funding was provided for  the appointment of five infection-control nurses for trusts. Those measures are  intended to ensure that all staff have the skills, training and equipment that  they need to reduce the spread of healthcare-associated infections. More  importantly, they should also help to restore public confidence in the health  and social care service.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I said that this is an interim report, because the review  team cannot have full access to the affected wards until we are sure that the  outbreak is over. I have, therefore, given the review team an extension for  delivering its final report. That extension does not mean that anyone is less  committed to ending the outbreak or to improving infection control across  Northern Ireland &mdash; quite the opposite. We are determined to get to the root  causes of the outbreak. I have asked the review team to produce its final report  as soon as possible after the outbreak is over, and it is expected to deliver  the report by the end of July.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The review team is determined that the best way to discover  the cause of the outbreak is by a root-cause analysis, which is a retrospective  inquiry to identify how and why an incident happened. The purpose of that  approach is not to apportion blame but to identify preventable factors and the  lessons that must be learned. Once the team has completed that review, it will  review the Changing the Culture action plan, and it is aiming to complete that  job by the end of October.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I acknowledge the work of the review team and the fact that  it has delivered such a substantial and important report in a short space of  time.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">During discussions on the clostridium difficile outbreak at  the end of last year, there were calls for a public inquiry. At that time, I  said that I was minded to hold such an inquiry. However, my first priority was  to ensure that the outbreak was contained and that other health trusts were  taking every possible step to prevent clostridium difficile outbreaks from  occurring in hospitals. I did not take that step lightly, nor did I take it  without the expert advice of the Chief Medical Officer for Northern Ireland,  Dr Michael McBride.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The situation required an urgent response and immediate  action, and I believed that a public inquiry could not deliver that. In fact, a  public inquiry at that time would have served only to deflect staff from their  vital work in trying to reduce and control infections, such as clostridium  difficile and MRSA. That would have put patients at risk, and I cannot and will  not do that. Furthermore, a public inquiry could not have delivered so much in  such a compressed period.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">As I have said before, it is not possible to eliminate  healthcare-associated infections completely, but we can and must adopt a  zero-tolerance approach to them. That means that no case of infection is  regarded as acceptable, and the response to each new case is immediate and  urgent.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Healthcare-associated infections cause pain and distress to  patients, and the outbreak has led to a loss of public confidence in our health  and social care service. It is clear from the RQIA&rsquo;s interim report that  healthcare staff at all levels take the matter very seriously and are working  extremely hard, often under severe pressure, to reduce the spread of such  infections.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">My Department is considering the interim report carefully,  and its recommendations, in particular, which require a region-wide response.  Infection, prevention and control are everyone&rsquo;s business, and the inquiry  shows the value of co-operation in making healthcare safer and restoring  people&rsquo;s confidence in their healthcare system.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for Health,  Social Services and Public Safety (Mrs <strong>O&rsquo;Neill)</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I wish that I could welcome the  Minister&rsquo;s statement, but, unfortunately, it is lacking in detail and  substance. At the heart of this issue is the fact that more than 40 people have  died from hospital-acquired infections. Families of the deceased and others who  have contracted hospital-acquired infections want and deserve answers.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">People have cancelled their surgeries and hospital visits  because of fears of acquiring such infections, yet the Minister is discussing  an incomplete inquiry. According to the Minister, the report makes 36  recommendations to improve current standards and practices in hospitals.  However, neither I, as Deputy Chairperson of the Health Committee, nor any  other Member have received a copy of that report. When will we receive a copy  of it, and when will the 36 recommendations be implemented?</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">If we want to restore public confidence in the Health  Service, we must see action, and we must see those recommendations implemented.  It has been six months since the first outbreak was discussed in the House, and  we still do not have answers for people. When will those people get answers?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: As I explained to the  Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson of the Committee this morning, I have only  just received the report. I will share the report with all Members later today,  and Mrs O&rsquo;Neill will be able to examine it more closely then.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">There are key messages in that report, which we are  considering. One of the key messages concerns the state of our hospital  buildings. It is very difficult to keep old buildings up to the levels of  cleanliness of new ones. There is a shortage of pharmacists who are skilled in  the application of specific types of antibiotics to deal with particular  infections. Furthermore, there is a shortage of microbiologists and a need for  infection-control nurses. With the benefit of hindsight, those people should  have been in place. However, this is a recent phenomenon, and we are working  and moving quickly to try to deal with it.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I have already put some measures in place, such as the  Changing the Culture action plan. I also announced further measures, to which I  referred in my speech, including restrictions on hospital visiting, a dress  code for staff, a regional hand-hygiene campaign and MRSA screening for  high-risk patients, among other measures.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Those measures are working effectively, as is the raft of  other measures, such as single rooms and newbuilds. As I reported to the House  previously, environmental cleanliness audits and unannounced inspections are  now in place. After consideration, the review team did not disagree with the  introduction of those measures. However, as its role requires, the team has  identified gaps.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Mrs O&rsquo;Neill is correct; we must increase public confidence,  which has been knocked since the incidences of healthcare-associated  infections. We understand &mdash; or at least accept &mdash; that we can never eliminate  those infections; we can, however, restrict them to the absolute minimum level.</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  Will the Minister outline how many new cases of clostridium difficile were  identified at Antrim   Area Hospital  last month? Is sufficient funding in place to implement the 36 recommendations  to reduce clostridium difficile levels? What measures are in place to screen  hospital staff who might carry the infection?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Expert advice suggests that  screening for clostridium difficile is not helpful. For example, a large  proportion of over 65s &mdash; approximately 30% &mdash; carry clostridium difficile. When  symptoms emerge, we must react, instigate isolation and control the infection.  At Antrim Area Hospital,  the number of deaths has decreased from February&rsquo;s peak of 14, to three in  March, two in April and two in May.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">If we can restrict deaths to that level, the outbreak can be  declared over. However, we must reach a point at which no new cases are  emerging. The number of new cases has decreased from 20 in January 2008 to 10  in February, 17 in March, 18 in April and three in May. Therefore, the numbers  are tailing off, but it takes time to reach the point at which we can declare  the outbreak over. The problem is that the review team cannot complete its  inquiry until the outbreak is over. We cannot remove staff from isolation wards  to deal with the inquiry team&rsquo;s queries until we are confident that the  outbreak is over &mdash; otherwise lives will be at risk.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert  Coulter</strong>: On behalf of my constituents, I congratulate the Minister on  introducing initiatives to contain and eliminate the clostridium difficile  outbreak. I pay tribute to the staff &mdash; particularly in the Northern Health and  Social Care Trust &mdash; who have worked hard to combat clostridium difficile.  During my numerous visits, I witnessed the work conducted by the chief  executive of that trust, Norma Evans, and her team.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister agree that staff must not be deflected  from their duties? Will he commit to offer the future support that is necessary  to eliminate the problem of clostridium difficile?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I assure Rev Coulter that I will  leave no stone unturned in my quest to tackle that problem. The Northern Health  and Social Care Trust has worked hard and adopted a dedicated approach. I have  visited the isolation ward and talked to staff; one could not fail to be impressed  with their serious approach to their work.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">There is a shortage of the skilled infection-control  nurses, antibiotic pharmacists and microbiologists that are required. I will  consider a human resources strategy to determine how to deal with that situation.  The more serious consequences in the Northern Trust area, particularly in Antrim Area   Hospital, as the Member  is aware, have been caused by the new and virulent clostridium difficile 027  strain.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>: I  welcome the Minister&rsquo;s update. I have met the review team, and I appreciate the  time that it spent in informing me of its work. Although progress has been  made, and we are aware that the lowest number of deaths as a result of the  infection was recorded in May, we are still concerned that the infection is  ongoing.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister mentioned that the RQIA process highlighted  the staffing shortfall. Is that being addressed? Are infection reductions and  ward inspections being recorded in order to ensure that the maintenance of high  standards is continued?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Several unannounced inspections  have taken place already. They have been recorded, and reports have been  issued. The consequences of and responses to those reports will also be issued.  Unannounced inspections have taken place at Craigavon  Area Hospital,  Belfast City  Hospital, Downe  Hospital and Altnagelvin Area   Hospital. That work will  continue.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">We must address the staffing situation, and I am putting  resources in place as necessary. For example, there will be a pharmacist in  each trust area to work on this particular area. Microbiologists also play a  key role. The microbiologist in Antrim   Area Hospital  impressed me strongly when she spoke to me about the need for a microbiological  approach to the identification of both the infection and the correct antibiotic  to deal with it. We must move away from the broad-spectrum antibiotics that are  the root cause of so many problems.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">When infection breaks out, we must control it. In order to  do so, we must have skilled infection-control nurses, but we must also change  the infection-control culture, from the cleaners through to the chief  executives and the chairmen. We must have the right culture at the root of  everything that we do.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his report. However, it will not be of much comfort to  people who, over the past while, have lost loved ones as a result of this  outbreak. The report contains 36 recommendations, and another Member asked  whether the Minister would have the funding to put those recommendations into  practice as quickly as possible.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In the report, the review team identified the shortfall in  staffing levels. I am concerned about the Department&rsquo;s policy to achieve 3%  efficiency savings over the next three years under the RPA. That will commit  the Department to further staff reductions. If the Minister goes down that  road, will that complicate matters further and make it more difficult to  overcome clostridium difficile?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I have no choice but to go down  the road of the 3% efficiency savings. Over and over again, Members have  reinforced to me the need for efficiency. I heard a discussion this morning  between the Minister of Finance and Personnel and the Chair&shy;person of the  Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety on that issue. It is  important to point out, for example, that the Department&rsquo;s underspend last year  rose above 1% precisely because of its efficiency.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Department overachieved in savings on the drugs budget  to the tune of &pound;20 million more than was anticipated. That skewed our figures  over that 1% underspend, so instead of being the best-performing Department as  usual, it was the second-best. That information is contained in a letter to Mrs  Robinson, which I will circulate to all Members of the Committee for Health,  Social Services and Public Safety; I know that they will be interested in that.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Although we have been successful in achieving efficiencies,  not all efficiencies have to come at the expense of staff.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">We anticipate achieving reasonable efficiencies in our drug  budget, because it runs to about &pound;400 million a year through chemists&rsquo; shops  and pharmacies.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">As for staffing, we need staff with the right skills, and  there are gaps that we must fill. The phenomenon of healthcare-associated  infections appeared suddenly. Although clostridium difficile and MRSA have  always existed, the sudden rise in their incidence has taken the system by  surprise in recent years. We must get on top of that, because patient  confidence is everything. Anything that detracts from patients&rsquo; confidence in  the Health Service is very damaging to the healthcare of the entire population.  We have a first-class Health Service, manned by first-class staff, and I will  make every effort to ensure that systems are put in place where they are  needed.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement, and I commend him on the work that has  been done to try to eradicate clostridium difficile. Like the Deputy  Chairperson of the Health Committee, I am disappointed that the Committee has  not seen the 36 recommendations, and I look forward to seeing them.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">At the time of the clostridium difficile outbreak, concern  was expressed that nursing staff had no proper changing facilities, which  resulted in their travelling to and from work in their uniforms. What has the Department  done to address that matter? Is the Minister confident that his Department&rsquo;s  new initiatives to reduce the spread of infection are adequate, not only to  hold infection at bay, but to eradicate it?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The new initiatives must be  proven. All new initiatives are kept under constant review. For example, I have  asked Alice Casey and her independent review team to review the Department&rsquo;s  &lsquo;Changing the Culture&rsquo; action plan straight after completing their current  review of the outbreak in the Northern Trust. It is important that we keep on  top of the issue and keep the initiatives up to date.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to uniforms, infection control requires  protective equipment and clothing. That is essential for protecting the health  of staff. I have introduced a dress code for all staff, which will work its way  through the system as the trusts implement it. It is patchy at the moment, but  we will continue to develop a dress-code policy to ensure that staff are  recognisable to people attending hospital and that they are not carrying  infection by constantly wearing everyday clothes.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I too welcome the update from the  Minister. The RQIA review is mainly an in-house review. Although it can be  justified as an urgent response to the outbreak, we should acknowledge the need  to address public concerns. I wish to preface my question by commending the  dedication and professionalism of healthcare staff and the support and guidance  that they have been given by the RQIA.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">However, a review such as that by the RQIA does not  alleviate public alarm at the perception of falling hygiene standards. Indeed,  the RQIA process might even increase the frustration of many who feel that the  matter should have been dealt with more openly and transparently.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Six months on, will the Minister acknowledge the high level  of public concern, and recognise the need for a public inquiry into what caused  the initial outbreak, and why it was so difficult to access accurate,  up-to-date information on clostridium difficile-related deaths?</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">12.45 pm</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The review team is an  independent body that was recruited in England. Alice Casey and her team  possess an impressive amount of expertise. I hope that the Committee will have  an opportunity to speak to them in due course. It is 12 weeks &mdash; not six months  &mdash; since we established the review team.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">At that time, I also stated that I was minded to have a  public inquiry, not least to restore public confidence. However, a public  inquiry would take at least a year. Time limits can be set, but, ultimately,  the inspector will take as much time as he believes is required. A key element  of the inquiry will be to pull staff out of the trust, Antrim Area   Hospital, isolation  wards, and so on, to give evidence &mdash; and those people are busy at the moment.  The point that I made was that, at the moment, a public inquiry would have  difficulty in doing anything more than to carry out a general scoping of the  situation.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I will be advised by Members of the House and of the  Committee on whether to proceed with a public inquiry. Essential to restoring  public confidence in the Health Service is that the House should state that it  has confidence in the system. That would be a major boost. The public must have  confidence, rather than anxiety, in the Health Service. If and when we hold a  public inquiry, the work that Alice Casey&rsquo;s team has done will prove absolutely  invaluable and save months of work.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  My question concerns public confidence. Many people, such as the elderly, do  not have confidence in the Health Service and would prefer to be treated at  home. I was alarmed by the Minister&rsquo;s suggestion that the introduction of a  uniform policy is somewhat &ldquo;patchy&rdquo;. People would see a uniform policy at first  hand so &mdash; to encourage public confidence &mdash; surely, that issue should have been  addressed at the outset. Indeed, uniform policy has been discussed on the news,  and on &lsquo;Talkback&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Stephen Nolan Show&rsquo; on BBC Radio Ulster.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">When visiting hospitals, I have noticed that hand-washing  facilities are positioned only on wards. Would it not boost public confidence  if those facilities were located at hospital entrances, where everyone would be  encouraged to use them?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Hand-washing facilities should  be in place both on the wards and at hospital entrances. Our simple and key  message is: &ldquo;Wash your hands&rdquo;. If all visitors and staff routinely washed their  hands when entering and leaving hospital premises, there would be a major  reduction in the incidence of infections.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I said that uniform policy is &ldquo;patchy&rdquo; because it is not  consistent throughout the trusts. Hospitals must implement a uniform policy for  all staff &mdash; nurses, doctors, consultants and so on. They must all be dressed  appropriately to ensure that they are not carrying infection. The doctors and  nurses are the experts in this matter because they are the people who deal with  infections.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I also announced an environmental cleaning programme;  indeed, we have already held an environmental audit. Another important measure  is the restriction on hospital visits, as outlined in the Changing the Culture  action plan. It is not appropriate that anyone can walk into a hospital to make  a visit at any time of day or night. That was having an adverse impact on  wards, patients and staff. Intensive care units will be subject to strict  visiting times in the future. We will also examine meal times and a number of  other matters. However, I cannot implement such measures by clicking my  fingers; they must work their way through the system.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Given that staff co-operation is essential, they have to be  trained and instructed &mdash; it is not a matter of waving a magic wand. I am aware  that public interest in the matter has been reflected on the &lsquo;The Stephen Nolan  Show&rsquo; and on &lsquo;Talk Back&rsquo;. I have talked on the matter on both those programmes  on more than one occasion. We will continue to work on the problem. There is no  magic fix for it: it will take work and effort over a long time.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement, and I commend him for the speed with which  he brought it to the House after receiving the report. I join other Members in  paying tribute to Health Service staff at all levels. They have worked  tirelessly to make good progress on this outbreak in difficult circumstances.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister confirm that his decision to set up an  independent review has not hampered the efforts of staff? Does the interim  report provide any guidance on how we can restore public confidence and educate  the public on its responsibilities when visiting hospitals?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I confirm that the review has  not hampered the work of hospital staff, and I thank the Member for remarking  on how hard staff have worked. They have worked extremely hard, and they are  dedicated. At times, certain comments make them feel unappreciated, which is  unfortunate. They are doing sterling work. They did not invent the problem, but  they are dealing with it for the benefit of patients.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The inquiry made 36 recommendations. I received the report  on Sunday, and I will share it with the House before close of play this  afternoon so that Members have an early opportunity to see it. I have referred  in my speech to several of its recommendations, and I look forward to Members&rsquo;  responses.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  statement, and I, along with the Minister and other Members, commend the  efforts of healthcare staff.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I see from the Minister&rsquo;s statement that funding was  provided for five infection-control nurses last September. Have they been  appointed? Are there only five? Is there one infection-control nurse for the  Western Health and Social Care Trust area? Is there one nurse for the Tyrone County   Hospital, for example? Go  raibh maith agat.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: A team of infection-control  nurses is in operation. Furthermore, one director in charge of each trust area  &mdash; normally the medical director &mdash; looks after and is responsible for infection  control. He also has a team of people working on it. The nurses are a key  element in the strategy; however, that does not mean that there is only one  nurse in each trust area responsible for infection control. The important element  is the education of and support for the workforce. There are some 16,000 nurses  in the system, and the Western Trust has its allocation of those nurses, who  must be supported. If more support or extra people are required, I will  consider providing them. The infection-control strategy involves giving nurses  the support that they need, educating the workforce in preventing the spread of  infection, and promoting good practice.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Just as we have people in each trust who focus on staff  safety and support when staff are assaulted, we also have people in each trust  who focus on infection. That does not mean that that is the only work that is  being done &mdash; far from it.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s  statement, but it does not contain much detail for people to go on. However, it  is a progress report, so it has to be looked at as such. In the Minister&rsquo;s  response to questions on his statement, I detected that he was putting some  blame for the occurrence of clostridium difficile on patients, their families  and everyone else, but it seemed that the Department was washing its hands of  any blame. Ultimately, the blame lies with the Department that is running the  healthcare service. I do not think that everyone has access to a quality  healthcare service, particularly in my constituency of Mid Ulster where people  have been told that the local hospital is not safe, but patients are being  transferred there.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I congratulate most of the hospital staff, but not all of  them. Is the Minister aware that there are consultants in the Antrim Area  Hospital who are actually telling families that it is inevitable that an  elderly patient with clostridium difficile is going to die and that they should  prepare themselves for that? That consultant is also directing that the drips  and medication be removed; even water is being removed from some patients in  what they term the Liverpool pathway to death  system. Serious questions must be asked.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Recently, I visited Daisy  Hill Hospital,  and the facilities that the Minister says should be available in Antrim Area Hospital are not available in Daisy Hill Hospital. There is no isolation  facility; four, five and six visitors are permitted into the side ward of a  patient with clostridium difficile; there are no displayed notices stating that  there are clostridium difficile sufferers in the ward; and there are no  displayed notices instructing people to wash their hands. However, there is a  facility at the end of the ward at which people can wash their hands if they  wish.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">There are serious flaws in the system, and the Minister  must take responsibility for ensuring that the patients&rsquo; quality of life and  care is well attended to. That is particularly important for the elderly.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">People &mdash; especially the elderly &mdash; are not confident that  the healthcare facility is to enhance their healthcare and is not merely a  pathway to death, as seems to be the case. Will the Minister respond and ensure  that consultants in those hospitals are not preparing people for death and dismissing  the protestations of families? The Minister said that there was a reduction in  the number of deaths from clostridium difficile. I know why one patient was  saved from death. The elderly individual&rsquo;s family was told that the patient was  dying, but they protested and got the hospital staff to resume the patient&rsquo;s  drip treatment and medication.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Please ask a question, Mr Molloy.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  That was an important point, Mr Deputy Speaker. Will the Minister confirm that  that is happening in the Antrim   Area Hospital?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I repudiate entirely the  suggestion that I blamed patients and families. I said that hand hygiene was  one of the key steps towards helping to eradicate clostridium difficile, and I  have tried to emphasise that. I am not here to apportion blame; I am here to  address the issue.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Molloy makes a very serious accusation against  consultants in Antrim   Area Hospital,  and I expect him to back it up by giving me the names of the consultants and  the families involved, so that I can carry out an investigation. His remarks  are not helpful as far as patient confidence and Antrim Area   Hospital staff are  concerned. I will investigate those matters and the so-called Liverpool  pathway to death. I am not aware of a Liverpool pathway to death system in Antrim Area   Hospital or any other  hospital. I will take action if Mr Molloy can prove that his accusations are  true. Allegations, accusations and assertions are made often, but I do not get  evidence. I look forward to the evidence in this case.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I will also investigate the situation at the Daisy Hill   Hospital. The Southern  Health and Social Care Trust is a very good trust. The Member will be aware  that Daisy Hill Hospital  is one of the hospital buildings highlighted in the report as being long past  its sell-by date, and it is difficult to achieve the required levels. However,  that is no excuse for inadequate and inappropriate facilities. Hand washing is  part of the hand-hygiene measures that I expect trusts to observe.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has arranged to meet immediately upon the  lunchtime suspension. I therefore propose, by leave of the Assembly, to suspend  the sitting until 2.00 pm.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The sitting was suspended at 1.00 pm.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">On resuming (Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Dallat] in the  Chair) &mdash;</p>

	        <p class="H5StageHeading"><a name="4"></a>North/South Minsterial Council &mdash; Aquaculture and Marine  Sectoral Meeting</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I have received notice from the Minister of Agriculture and Rural  Development that she wishes to make a statement regarding the North/South  Ministerial Council aquaculture and marine sectoral meeting.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development (Ms Gildernew)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a  LeasCheann Comhairle. I wish to make a statement in compliance with section 52  of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 regarding the recent meeting of the  North/South Ministerial Council (NSMC) in aquaculture and marine sectoral  format. The meeting was held at Dublin   Castle on Wednesday 21  May 2008. The Executive were represented by Edwin Poots MLA, Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure, and myself. The Irish Government were represented by  Eamon Ryan TD, Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. This  statement has been agreed with Minister Edwin Poots.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The chairperson of the board of the Foyle, Carlingford and  Irish Lights Commission, Mr Tarlach O&rsquo;Crosain, and the chief executive of the  Loughs Agency, Mr Derick Anderson, presented a report to the Council on  developments that have occurred since the previous meeting in November 2007.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers noted that the Loughs Agency is developing plans  for the delivery of its marine tourism and recreational fishing strategy and  asked the chief executive to formulate a fuller report on that strategy, detailing  plans for collaborative work with other bodies, to be presented at a future  meeting of the Council.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted the ongoing work to develop an emergency  procedure for the approval of regulations to deal with events requiring  immediate intervention for the protection of the fisheries in the Foyle and  Carlingford areas. Ministers received a comprehensive presentation on the  Loughs Agency&rsquo;s aquaculture and shellfisheries strategy, and, following  discussions, agreed that they look forward to receiving a report on its  implement&shy;ation at a future meeting.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers also noted the agency&rsquo;s plan to finalise a  management agreement later this year, with a view to initiating aquaculture  licensing in Lough Foyle during 2009.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted progress on the commencement Orders that  are required for a staged and managed introduction of the new powers that are  available to the Loughs Agency to develop and license aquaculture and to  protect the fisheries in the Foyle and Carlingford areas. Ministers welcomed  the agency&rsquo;s legislation implementation plan and noted that NSMC approval will  be required for five sets of regulations in June and for a further nine sets later  in 2008.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Council agreed that its next meeting in the aquaculture  and marine sectoral format would take place in June 2008, with a further  meeting in October or November 2008. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development (Dr W McCrea)</strong>: The  Council noted:</p>
	        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the ongoing work to develop an emergency procedure  for the approval of regulations to deal with events requiring immediate  intervention&rdquo;.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">What emergency procedures does the Minister have in mind so  that she can intervene now to ensure that no more boats from the Northern Ireland  fleet follow the seven vessels that have been forced to tie up in the past two  weeks because of escalating fuel costs? Where are the emergency procedures to  deal with such events, which demand immediate departmental intervention? Why  can the Minister not find the &pound;1 million for the de minimis scheme, which would  represent an immediate intervention, when her Department has underspent its  budget by more than &pound;31 million?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Develop&shy;ment</strong>: The NSMC meeting in aquaculture and  marine sectoral format dealt solely with issues that come under the Foyle,  Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission&rsquo;s area of responsibility. The Chairman  of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development&rsquo;s question deals with  issues that are outside that area of responsibility. Therefore, it is not  appropriate for me to deal with those issues as part of my statement. However,  if the Chairman writes to me about those issues, which, I accept, are urgent, I  am happy to address them.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a  ghabh&aacute;il leis an Aire as a r&aacute;iteas.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">When will the fishermen of Lough Foyle, who have  surrendered their drift nets, receive their hardship payments?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Develop&shy;ment</strong>: In December 2007, the Loughs Agency  made the first payments to affected fishermen, which totalled &euro;2&middot;5 million. I  was fully aware of the matter, partly due to lobbying by Foyle MLAs. The second  stage of the payment, which totalled &euro;600,000, was paid in April 2008, and the  final stage of the payment is expected to occur in spring 2009.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement, particularly the Loughs Agency&rsquo;s marine-tourism  plans in Foyle. Does the Minister know with whom the Loughs Agency is  co-operating to implement those plans?</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I have some concerns about recreational fishing. Why did no  consultation take place with the Loughs Agency advisory forum before fishing was  banned on the River Finn? Why is the modern and accessible fishing area at  Greenbrae, which is on the River Foyle near Lifford, still not open despite the  amount of money that was spent preparing it for fishermen?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Develop&shy;ment</strong>: The Council will receive a full  presentation on the marine-tourism strategy at the next meeting. Ministers were  informed about the Loughs Agency application for more than &euro;8 million of  funding for the strategy and about smaller-scale projects, such as angling  development, which are about to receive agency funding. I encourage the  agency&rsquo;s chief executive to ensure that those projects benefit both tourists  and local people in the areas concerned.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The agency is developing regulations to provide for  permit-controlled angling on the tidal River Foyle at the Greenbrae&rsquo;s fishery.  The agency expects to go to public consultation on its proposals in the near  future, and it is anticipated that those regulations will come into operation  in early 2009.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Member recognised that, in order to conserve stocks,  that measure was required. That matter will be the subject of public  consultation.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  Does the Department have any intention to widen the aquaculture initiatives to  other parts of the Province, including Lough Neagh and Strangford Lough?</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Some concern has been expressed about intensive  for-the-plate aquaculture enterprises and the fear that, sometimes, diseases  that can result from that industry can infect some native species. Will the  Minister advise the House what steps have been taken to ensure that any disease  that can result from intensive aquaculture will not, and cannot, reach native  fish and species?</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">My second question perhaps comes under the Minister&rsquo;s  remit, as well as that of the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure, Edwin  Poots, because it concerns angling and fishing initiatives. We are all aware  that fishing initiatives can bring great benefits to the whole Province. Will  there be a spin-off from angling tourism and initiatives that would reach far  beyond Carlingford Lough and Lough Foyle?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Develop&shy;ment</strong>: The NSMC met to discuss the Foyle and  Carlingford areas. During that meeting, the Loughs Agency presented its plans  for aquaculture in those areas. Significant potential exists to develop that  sector, which is already valuable in both areas.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The transfer of aquaculture-licensing powers to the Foyle,  Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission will allow aquaculture operations in  Lough Foyle to be licensed through the Loughs Agency for the first time. That  is an important step to ensure that a transparently good standard of practice  in relation to husbandry, hygiene, fish welfare, disease control and  environmental impact is in place. Control also exists through regulations under  EU directives and aquaculture-licensing conditions.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The aquaculture sector is not punching above its weight.  Further potential exists for the European fisheries fund to be used again for  aquaculture opportunities.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Loughs Agency is 5conducting a review into its licence  fees and charges, and decisions on the settlement of fees for the 2009 season  will be taken on the basis of the findings of that review.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I am taking questions on what was discussed at the NSMC  sectoral meeting; therefore, further issues about licensing should not be  discussed during this plenary sitting. However, I am happy to respond in  writing to any queries that the Member may have.</p>
	        <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="5"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
	        <p class="H4StageHeading">Northern Ireland Events Company</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I have received notice from the Minister of Culture, Arts and  Leisure that he wishes to make a statement on the Northern Ireland Events  Company (NIEC).</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure (Mr Poots)</strong>: I am grateful for the opportunity to  make a further statement to the Assembly about the Northern Ireland Events  Company. Members will be aware that, last September, the acting chief executive  and accounting officer of the Northern Ireland Events Company notified the  Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL) that he had become aware of a  significant overspend, and that the company was in a budget-deficit position.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">At the insistence of DCAL, an emergency board meeting was  convened on 5 October 2007, and the company was directed by the Department to  establish the extent of the overspend, and to provide an explanation as to how  it arose. The departmental accounting officer accordingly informed the  Comptroller and Auditor General, and I briefed the Executive on 8 November  2007. On 22 November 2007, following consultation with the Minister of Finance  and Personnel, I presented a paper to the Executive.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">At their meeting on 22 November 2007, the Northern Ireland  Executive agreed that DCAL would:</p>
	        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;meet the liabilities of the NIEC as identified by  external auditors appointed by the company as presented at today&rsquo;s Executive  and to be verified by the professional financial adviser appointed by DCAL with  a view to the company being wound up at the earliest opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Northern Ireland Events Company was instructed not to  enter into any further financial commitments without the express permission of  the Department, and that its activities should focus solely on winding up its  affairs in an orderly fashion. On 26 November 2007, I made a statement to the  Assembly that informed Members of the background to the financial deficit of  the NIEC and the steps that had been agreed by the Executive to address the  matter.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In my statement, I said that I wanted to implement a comprehensive  and authoritative review of the financial affairs of the company in order to  enable me to fully assess the position. In addition, I said that I would advise  the House further when that position became clearer. I also said that I would  commission an independent comprehensive review of all the circumstances  surrounding the deficit accumulated by NIEC and report back to the House, at  the earliest opportunity, on the findings of that review.</p>	        
        <p class="B3BodyText">On 28 November 2007, the Department asked KPMG independent  professional financial advisers to carry out a comprehensive and authoritative  review of the financial affairs of the company; to advise on meeting the  existing liabilities of NIEC and the most appropriate method of winding up the  company in an orderly manner; and to carry out a comprehensive review of all  the circumstances surrounding the deficit accumulated by NIEC.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It was anticipated that the report on the independent  review of NIEC would have been completed by the end of February 2008. Essential  to that review were interviews with board members of NIEC and the former chief  executive, in which they were given opportunities to answer some specific  questions in relation to their knowledge and understanding of how the deficit arose.  Owing to the time that was required to conduct those interviews &mdash; and the  complex and sensitive matters that were being examined &mdash; the report was not  completed within the original timescale.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Department has now received the draft independent  review report. It contains matters of public concern, about which Members will  wish to be fully informed. I have a duty to ensure that those matters are  brought to the attention of this House, and to ensure that they are dealt with  rigorously and urgently.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The report contains matters of a sensitive legal and  financial nature, on which I sought advice. In making this statement, I must be  mindful of the possibility of further investigative work. I do not wish to  prejudice the continuing investigations by what I say in the House. As a result  of those investigations, certain matters could be referred to the PSNI and,  ultimately, to the Public Prosecution Service (PPS).</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, matters may also be referred to the Department  of Enterprise, Trade and Investment for further action under companies  legislation. As a Government Minister, I do not want to prejudice those further  investigations, or the potential for properly holding those responsible to  account. I must, therefore, restrict my public comment at this stage. These are  serious matters, with potentially serious financial consequences. However, in  outlining the key findings of the report, I assure Members that I will be as  open and informative as I can be within those constraints and circumstances.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">By 31 March 2008, KPMG estimated the NIEC financial deficit  to be &pound;1,662,450. That figure excludes non-quantifiable contingent liabilities,  and has accum&shy;ulated since 1 March 2005, when it was &pound;440,337. The deficit  occurred because of a fundamental breakdown of controls and procedures at a  number of levels. The company began to directly manage and carry out activities  in relation to certain events without the knowledge and proper approval of the  board, as opposed to the normal practice of providing grant aid to third parties.  In addition, the company did that without the knowledge or approval of DCAL.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">NIEC entered into future-years commitments without  accounting for such commitments properly, without proper departmental authority  to do so, or clear budgetary provision for those commitments.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">One contract was entered into as late as last September, one  week before the company informed the Department of the financial deficit. That  contract permitted the company to run certain motocross events for each year up  until 2012.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The deficit was not uncovered for a number of reasons:  inaccuracies in the accounts; lack of clarity and understanding of accounting  policies; excess funding was drawn down from DCAL; in-year bids were made to  DCAL for additional funding; sponsorship and other income was used by the  company, and payments were deferred from one financial year to the next.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Under company law, the board was responsible for the  company&rsquo;s affairs. The chief executive and, subsequently, the acting chief  executive, were accounting officers for the Northern Ireland Events Company for  the relevant periods and appear to have enjoyed the full confidence of the  board. The chief executive, as accounting officer, had particular  responsibility for informing the board on all matters relating to the financial  management of the company.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">However, the board may have been denied relevant  information about the true financial position of NIEC. In addition, the  evidence strongly suggests that the board was not sufficiently involved or  informed prior to major funding commitments being entered into. There is  nothing on the record to indicate that the board was made aware of the  substantial financial obligations that were being taken on in the name of NIEC,  and there is some evidence to show that by the time the board was consulted, a  commitment had already been entered into in some cases. If the board had been  more robust in its interrogative approach, it may have been alerted to those  issues earlier.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The company&rsquo;s accounting officer also had particular responsibility  to ensure that the Department was notified properly of underspends and  overspends. It will be a matter of public concern as to why those  responsibilities were not properly exercised, and they will be subject to  further investigation. Operational controls lie very clearly with the Northern  Ireland Events Company&rsquo;s directors and accounting officer. The Department was  heavily reliant on both the accounting officer and the directors discharging  their responsibilities effectively.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Department&rsquo;s role was to ensure that the fundamental  architecture of governance was put in place. The KPMG report found that  although there was a framework of governance and controls put in place by the  Department, there was a breakdown in the operation of those controls and good  governance that led to fundamental breaches of extensive parts of the company&rsquo;s  constitution, rules and authorities. That led to an estimated &pound;1,662,450, which  the company&rsquo;s accounting officers were personally responsible for controlling,  being committed on behalf of NIEC without proper control or authorisation. The  lion&rsquo;s share of that money was used to finance a small number of motocross-type  events from 2004 onwards. The situation was allowed to continue for some time  until, effectively, the company ran out of funding in September 2007.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In KPMG&rsquo;s opinion, the management of the company finances,  financial reporting and financial controls were poor; the directors did not  fully discharge all their director obligations; they placed an over-reliance on  the former chief executive and the external auditors, and they delegated powers  to the former chief executive without proper controls. The duties set out in  the accounting officer designation letters were not performed adequately, and  the accounting officer&rsquo;s statement on internal control and reliance on  represent&shy;ations at regular monitoring meetings provided the Department with  assurances that have proved to be unfounded. The Department did not identify  the shortcomings due to the lack of a sufficiently interrogative and robust  challenge of the company&rsquo;s accounting officer and the board.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The report raises serious questions about the conduct of  named individuals and suggests further investigation. It does not discount the  possibility of fraud, criminal activity or civil proceedings, and the  Department will need to consider carefully whether it can seek to recover money  that may have been obtained unlawfully or payments that have been made on the  basis of misrepresentations by certain parties.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The potential for recovery will require careful  consideration and, if appropriate, vigorous pursuit. It is, therefore, vital  that I, the Department and the House take no action that would inadvertently  prejudice those investigations or make any recovery more difficult.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In my statement to the House on 26 November 2007, I  reported that the Executive had agreed that my Department should assist in  meeting the existing liabilities of NIEC, as verified by an appropriate independent  professional appointed by my Department. I can now tell the House that 144  creditors were owed a total of &pound;938,008&middot;87. Of those creditors, 135, or 94%,  have been paid a total of &pound;884,221&middot;95. Under the direction of the board, and in  consultation with my Department, those creditors that have not been paid are being  investigated. Once they are verified, my Department will be in a position to  deal with them in the same way as the other creditors.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Department is also aware that independent financial  advisers identified several contingent liabilities on NIEC, some of which are,  at this stage, unquantifiable. They include any costs arising from potential  legal action and winding-up costs. The board, in conjunction with DCAL, is  examining and dealing with each liability and unverified creditor on a case-by-case  basis, and legal advice is being taken with a view to resolving, or otherwise,  those claims.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As the precise nature and extent of the contingent  liabilities remain the cause of some concern, the manner in which the company  handles them will have a significant impact on whether the company is solvent  or insolvent when it is wound up. Legally, that is a matter for the board of  directors in the first instance.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I also reported to the House that an external review had  been commissioned of the monitoring arrangements between the Department and  other arm&rsquo;s-length bodies for which it is responsible. The review was carried  out by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, a  professional accountancy body that specialises in the public sector. Its report  is being finalised, but I understand that it identifies several areas that  require improvement to address areas of weakness in DCAL&rsquo;s sponsorship of its  arm&rsquo;s-length bodies. In line with commitments made to the Public Accounts  Committee, the departmental accounting officer will progress the report&rsquo;s  recommendations as a matter of urgency.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In reporting these matters to the House, I am conscious  that significant benefits resulted from attracting major events to Northern Ireland.  The rationale for taking such urgent and decisive steps is to ensure that  worthwhile events can proceed, but I remain adamant that they must do so within  a properly controlled financial framework. Therefore, I have given urgent  consideration to the future delivery of the events function and how to ensure  that the transition to any new arrangements agreed under the review of public  administration (RPA) is managed in a manner that secures the continuity of  attracting and hosting major events in Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Under RPA, the assumption was that promotional activities  and events would transfer from DCAL to DETI, where the functions would be  discharged by the Northern Ireland Tourist Board (NITB). Under that  arrangement, the company was to be dissolved by the current directors. DETI has  indicated that it remains committed, in principle, to the transfer, but that in  light of ongoing disclosures, its continued commitment is subject to its being  satisfied with the results of due diligence inquiries.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive made the decision to protect, as far as  possible, the business continuity of imminent events and those in the pipeline  and, in due course, to transfer the events function to NITB and DETI, subject  to my agreement and that of the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment. I agreed  that my Department would take on the interim management of the events function.  An events unit has been established in DCAL to deal with outstanding grant  funding agreements and outstanding applications made to NIEC to the end of  October 2007. Further grant funding programmes have been launched for funding  available from the major events fund and the events growth fund.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">2.30 pm</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Twenty-six applications were received by the closing date  of 2 May, and they are being evaluated with a view to grant-funding decisions  being made by mid-June. The events unit will not engage in running events  directly: that will be the role of appropriately experienced and qualified  event promoters and organisers.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Members are aware that the Public Accounts Committee is the  Standing Committee of the Assembly that is responsible for examining such  matters. That Committee has given early consideration to the Northern Ireland  Events Company in its &lsquo;Report on Good Governance &mdash; Effective Relationships  between Departments and their Arm&rsquo;s Length Bodies&rsquo;, dated 24 April 2008. I  share that Committee&rsquo;s view that this is one of the most serious failures of  control in an arm&rsquo;s-length body in recent years, and I understand that it  intends to revisit the matter in some detail once the investigatory process is  complete. I am sure that the House will not wish to pre-empt the further  investigations required or the findings of the Public Accounts Committee. I am  assured that the matter will be examined thoroughly and that the lessons will  be learned and applied.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure (Mr McElduff)</strong>: Go raibh  maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I place on record my Committee&rsquo;s  dissatisfaction with the poor level of engagement there has been ahead of  today&rsquo;s statement. Many efforts were made today to gain clarification; to gain  a briefing for the Committee, or the Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson, or to  even have the Committee furnished with a copy of the statement well in advance of  its release to the House. None of those high standards of consultation with the  Committee were observed.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">How much responsibility does the Department accept for the  gross mismanagement of the public finances under its control? Given the way in  which the Minister has presented the situation, one could be forgiven for  thinking that he is washing his hands of responsibility for an arm&rsquo;s-length  body. The Committee was told that the Department is examining all arrangements  for non-departmental public bodies to prevent this sort of thing happening  again. What has been the outcome of the external review of the monitoring  arrangements between the Department and other arm&rsquo;s-length bodies for which it  is responsible to make sure that this does not happen again?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: As far as the Department is concerned,  significant infrastructure and control mechanisms were put in place, which in  turn placed a high level of responsibility on the chief executive and board of  the company; and the Department was responsible for monitoring those controls.  In reality, the responsibilities were not discharged fully and fell well short  of the public accountability requirements envisaged in those infrastructure and  control mechanisms.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The control framework that was in place included: establishing  the body as a company limited by guarantee; its articles and memorandum of  association; management statement and financial memoranda; corporate and  business plans; quarterly monitoring meetings; provision of financial  information as part of monthly financial meetings and support of draw-down  funds; an annual report; and financial accounts.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Department has highlighted matters of concern relating  to its role in monitoring and overseeing the NIEC, and it is considered that  the Department was insufficiently assertive in its oversight of the company.  The Department placed an over-reliance on the board to meet its obligations  under company law and had an over-reliance on trust that the former chief  executive was meeting her accounting officer responsibilities. Certain issues  relating to the process for drawing down funds by NIEC also highlighted  problems.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  I want to pick up on the point regarding the accountability arrangements  because it is clear that the subsequent review has identified a number of  shortcomings to which the Minister has referred.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister undertake to give a more detailed account  to the Committee in due course of the findings that have emerged from the  review; the lessons that have been learned; what changes will be put in place,  and whether there are lessons for other Departments that deal with arm&rsquo;s-length  companies? Is it possible to get some indication of the probable timescale in  which there might be some indication of movement on the company&rsquo;s transfer to DETI  and the recovery of money outstanding?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: Subsequent arrangements that have been put in  place are based on the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy&rsquo;s  recommendations. As Minister, I will engage directly with one of the  arm&rsquo;s-length bodies in an accountability meeting this afternoon in order to  ensure personally that I am satisfied with the accountability measures that  have been put in place.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I am happy to brief the Committee further on the matter and  any others that are outstanding after the debate, should the Committee feel  that it is in its interest and that of the Northern Ireland public. Throughout  our discussions, however, we must remain cognisant that further investigations  on the matter are ongoing and that their outcomes may, in due course, be  reported to the police and the Public Prosecution Service. In some respects, I  am constrained because although I want to tell the Assembly and the public as  much as possible about what happened and how that public money was lost, I do  not want to do so in such a way that would impinge upon the forces of law and  order taking their due course.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: At this juncture, it may be useful to remind Members that although  privilege is attached to the House&rsquo;s proceedings, it is only in respect of any  potential action for defamation. In the past, the Speaker has reminded Members  that that privilege should be exercised responsibly. I urge Members to bear  that caution in mind for the rest of the debate.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for that timely warning. I hope that I do not  stray across any imaginary line.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It gives me great sadness to be present at the debate and  to hear about the Events Company, which did so much to restore Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  image and undo, in a constructive way, the damage that was caused during 30  years of terrorism; and to hear that, in that particular instance, the  procedures that the Department should have followed to ensure that the Events  Company followed the right path in all of those matters were not fully  surveyed.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I am particularly concerned by the significant number of  creditors who find themselves exposed because of the company&rsquo;s demise. The  matter has caused grave concern among Committee members, who are anxious that  people who have outstanding invoices are dealt with as quickly as possible. As  I recall from the Minister&rsquo;s statement, some 6% have not, as yet, been dealt  with. Will the Minister assure the House that they will be dealt with as  speedily as possible, so that no one will find themselves financially exposed  in a manner that was not of their making?</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">During the debate, I have listened carefully to the  Minister&rsquo;s comments. Faults may or may not have occurred in the Events Company  itself: that will be determined by someone else, somewhere else, in the future.  However, there is no doubt that the Department&rsquo;s role in the situation has been  less than flattering. Surely, if the Minister&rsquo;s Department and others will rely  on arm&rsquo;s-length agencies to carry out certain functions on the community&rsquo;s  behalf, it is incumbent on the parent Department to ensure that it not only  covers all of the angles that it should cover, but any that a logical, careful  civil servant, departmental official or Minister ought to cover in the public&rsquo;s  interest.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: As regards the 6% of creditors that are still  outstanding, those who provided genuine services and are shown to have acted in  good faith with a verifiable contract in place will be paid. I will give that  assurance. However, I do not believe that the House or the public want anyone  to be paid when that is not the case.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Ultimately, we must be absolutely sure. To have dealt with  the issue and paid 94% of creditors is good, although the matter of outstanding  individuals with genuine claims should be addressed as quickly as possible.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Member raised the valid point that the Government and  the Departments are heavily reliant on arm&rsquo;s-length bodies to carry out  functions on behalf of the Government. That involves expenditure of large  amounts of public moneys, and the case of the Northern Ireland Events Company  has brought into stark focus the potential for such arrangements to go wrong.  The Northern Ireland Events Company involved fairly modest spending in  comparison with other arm&rsquo;s-length bodies, so that should represent a  significant wake-up call to Government about the practices and processes that  are in place when arm&rsquo;s-length bodies conduct affairs on behalf of Government.  As Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure, I am conscious of that. Every other  Minister must also be conscious of that, and attention must be paid to that  issue.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  Notice of the Minister&rsquo;s statement was received only half an hour before the  start of the plenary session. That is not fair to Members, who need to prepare  for such statements. The Minister said that he would be happy to come before  the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure, but the short notice that Members  were given of his statement means that he will have to do that, because the  Committee will need to examine areas that were not covered during the debate.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister said that the company committed to a contract  to hold motocross events in each year up to 2012. How much money was committed,  and is the contract still legally binding on the Department? The Minister said  that the lion&rsquo;s share of a sum of money was used to finance motocross events  from 2004 onwards. How much was allocated to those events, and how many events  or organisations were involved?</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with Ken Robinson&rsquo;s comments. A cloud has been  placed over the ability to prepare and advance events in Northern Ireland,  which had been done well through the capacity and expertise of the Events  Company.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Is the Minister confident that events of the same nature  can be delivered? He referred to the major events funds and the events growth  fund. How much money is available under those funds, compared with what was  available from the Events Company during the same period? All those groups now  face a difficulty because the Events Company had a capacity to access private  or sponsorship moneys to assist in match funding the events. Is the Minister  confident that the same types of events, which have brought international  acclaim to Northern Ireland,  can be delivered?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I will make available in writing to the Member  the amount of money that was offered to the motocross events up to 2012. The  expenses and the deficit were run up between 2004 and 2007, and were largely,  but not exclusively, based on annual motocross events, the running of which the  Events Company took responsibility for.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The events budget, which is now managed by the Department,  is &pound;1&middot;6 million &mdash; the same amount that was available to the Northern Ireland  Events Company. That is not decided on the basis of matched funding; in most  instances, we would like considerably more than 50% matched funding to come  from the events. We seek to ensure that events that are good for Northern  Ireland can happen with as little support as possible from the public purse,  and that those events can continue to grow.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">That is what we are about. We are not about giving out  large amounts of money just for the sake of securing events; we are about  supporting events that are close to economic viability, when, perhaps, our  support might secure their ongoing viability.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement, but I must reiterate what my fellow  Committee member Pat Ramsey and the Committee Chairperson said about the lack  of time that we have been given to read it. First, is the Minister satisfied  that sufficient control was exercised by the Department in relation to the  Northern Ireland Events Company? Secondly, is the Minister satisfied that the  correct people were appointed to the company in the first place, and have  appointment procedures changed or been revised since then?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: In hindsight, no. However, that will also be the  case in the future, no matter which regime is in place. Appointments will be  made by Government or arm&rsquo;s-length bodies that will prove not to be the best  appointments.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure was responsible  for monitoring the Northern Ireland Events Company, and it was not robust  enough when carrying out its duties. Criticism of the Department will be  extrapolated when the Public Accounts Committee undertakes its work.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  As we all know, particular events promote, and give status to, the Province,  and securing such events was the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Events  Company. Nevertheless, no one can deny that that company&rsquo;s actions have blotted  our reputation, and the financial deficit of more than &pound;1&middot;66 million is, in  itself, totally unacceptable and particularly worrying. The Northern Ireland  Events Company and the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure cannot stand  blameless for what happened.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister stated that he wants a &ldquo;comprehensive and  authoritative review&rdquo;. To those Members who made snide remarks, I say that, as  soon as the Minister was made aware of the problem, he initiated a full investi&shy;gation.  Members know that, and today&rsquo;s statement to the Assembly is part of that  investigation. The Minister deserves great credit for the manner in which he  has responded by initiating the investigation and ensuring that all evidence  has been brought to the Chamber, and other Members are aware that he responded  positively.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Is there any evidence of fraud, will there be further investigations,  and has the inquiry that the Minister mentioned earlier unearthed more  concerns? Furthermore, will the Minister confirm whether actions have occurred  that are contrary to company law and that may warrant further investigation,  and what measures have been put in place to ensure that similar problems will  not arise again? That is just one question, with a couple of amendments and  add-ons.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: It is your choice whether to answer, Minister.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Thus far, there is  no clear, substantive evidence of criminal intent or gain by anyone involved.  However &mdash; and that is a fairly major &ldquo;however&rdquo; &mdash; there is sufficient evidence  of fraudulent activity to warrant further investigation. As part of any further  investigations, the Department must consider whether it can seek to recover  moneys that may have been obtained unlawfully or payments that were made on the  basis of misrepresentations by certain parties. Therefore, it is vital that we  continue to consider those matters.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The independent review also found several irregularities in  the company&rsquo;s financial and payment-related procedures that give cause for  concern. Those include: the use of credit cards by certain members of the  company&rsquo;s executive; the procurement of services; company record keeping,  including bookkeeping irregularities; unusual, or possibly irregular, payments;  the payment of commission to members of staff; and an unauthorised &pound;200,000  overdraft in a bank account that was not disclosed to the Department. Those  potentially serious matters require full investigation.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The Minister&rsquo;s statement mentions  creditors, an issue that Ken Robinson raised earlier. Perhaps the wording in  the statement is incorrect &mdash; or perhaps I have read it incorrectly &mdash; but it  says:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Those creditors that have not been paid are being  investigated by the NIEC, under the direction of the board and in consultation  with my Department&rdquo;.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I read the draft independent review report, and I have  listened to the Minister&rsquo;s comments today. Is he saying that he has confidence  in the NIEC investigating the 6% of its creditors who did not receive any  payment? The investigation will take place under the direction of the board and  in consultation with the Department, but I take it that that was the process  that was followed all along, when the company was in operation. Does the  Minister have confidence in the NIEC&rsquo;s ability to carry out that investigation?  Go raibh maith agat.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: The responsibility for what happened lies with  the NIEC and its board. Under the circumstances that the Department has  arranged, I do have confidence in the NIEC&rsquo;s ability to deal with those issues.  The Department has asked independent financial experts to carry out that  investigation on behalf of the NIEC. That work has been overseen by a senior  civil servant in the Department, who has spent huge amounts of time with the  company and who has been engaged with the independent financial advisers  virtually full-time. It is not a case of the matter being dealt with by the  NIEC that ran up this particular deficit, as such; rather, the NIEC will be  provided with the expertise and help to ensure that the mess with which we have  been left can be dealt with professionally and for the public good.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  Has the matter been reported to the police?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: No clear, substantive evidence of criminal  intent or gain by anyone involved has come to light as yet. However, there may  be sufficient evidence of fraudulent activity to warrant further investigation.  We have consulted the PSNI and have passed the draft report of the independent  review of the NIEC to it for its consideration. The report has also been passed  to DETI for consideration of possible action under company law, which may have  some impact on the company&rsquo;s directors.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Is the Minister satisfied that the  Department&rsquo;s responsibilities for monitoring the NIEC were properly carried  out, given that months went by without the Department seeking monthly accounts  and that it failed to act on other financial information provided to it when it  should have done? This disaster could, arguably, have been avoided had the  Department carried out its responsibilities properly. Can the Minister assure  the House that the report is not an attempt to make a scapegoat of some people  in order to exonerate the Department from its responsibilities?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I am not seeking to exonerate the Department  from the responsibility that should be placed on it. We can certainly identify  who played a role in this matter &mdash; the accounting officer, the directors and  the board members all had a significant role to play. However, the Department  also played a significant role, and I am not in denial about that. The  Department did not engage robustly enough in the processes in which it was  involved. It had evidence that the Northern Ireland Events Company carried out  previous work well, but it did not robustly challenge the company&rsquo;s other  engagements. As a consequence of good faith, the situation was allowed to  develop.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There were periods when the Department was not quick enough  to look at the accounts or to keep on top of everything that was happening in  the Northern Ireland Events Company. As a result, we have ended up in this situation.  I do not blame the Department for that &mdash; the blame lies elsewhere. However, the  Department had a role to play in not being robust enough.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as a  r&aacute;iteas. In response to a question from Ken Robinson, the Minister spoke about  arm&rsquo;s-length bodies, lessons learned, and, obviously, lessons for the future. I  am mindful of that in asking my questions, because I know that the Committee  will be more than interested in his response. There are three main questions  that the Minister needs to answer for the Assembly &mdash; not today, perhaps, but in  the future.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">First, how was the matter able to go undetected? Reading  the Minister&rsquo;s statement, it looks as though it was detected when representatives  from the NI Events Company walked in, put their hands up and said that they had  run out of ideas on which to spend money and that they could not go on any  longer.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, where in the Department should the matter have  been spotted? In other words, who was responsible, and I do not mean an  individual, because this is not about individualising. Where in the system  should someone, somewhere along the line have realised that there had to be  something wrong with the company, given the way that it was spending its money?</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, when should the matter have been spotted? We need  a clear answer to that. It should have been spotted, for example, two or three  years ago. The investigation should examine the NI Events Company from its  inception, because if credit cards were being used wrongly, in order for there  to be a proper inquiry, we need to find out when that started and when it  ended.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, if there are to be arm&rsquo;s-length bodies to run Government  &mdash; and the Minister has said that there will be &mdash; we will at least know how to  spot the mistakes.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I indicated that the Department needed to be  more robust. Perhaps if it had been more robust in its engagement, the matter  could have been notified when the first significant deficit was run up, which I  think I quoted at &pound;440,000 in, I believe, 2005. If I am incorrect, the figure  will have been noted in the Hansard report. Had the monitoring processes been  carried through, the Department should have become alert to what was going on  at that early stage.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In summer 2006, two whistleblowers came to the Department  and drew to its attention matters with which they were not satisfied about the  running of the Northern Ireland Events Company. One of those whistleblowers came  to me, by arrangement with Ian Paisley Jnr, to bring those matters to my  attention, and that person repeated what had been said to civil servants. At  that point, I started to seek more information on the Northern Ireland Events  Company, to which greater attention was paid. That brought us to the point  where, in September, the matter became public knowledge.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is clear that the Events Company was operating with a  considerable faith from the Department. That faith was misplaced. As a  consequence, the Department, the Government and the public in Northern Ireland  have had their fingers burned. The affair has been very damaging for Northern  Ireland, and the steps that we have taken to ensure that genuine creditors are  paid and that we are in a position to organise more events is the best that we  could have put in place in the circumstances.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  The Minister&rsquo;s revelations are deeply disturbing on a host of levels. In his  statement, he said that the board was over-reliant on external auditors.  However, when other elements of his statement are examined, not only has &pound;1.6  million gone awry but:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;there were inaccuracies in the accounts; a lack of  clarity and understanding of the accounting policies&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">And, as he said in response to my colleague Jim  Shannon, an overdraft of &pound;200,000 was secreted in another bank account. Did the  company&rsquo;s external auditors give any warning to the board or to the Department  that things were going so severely wrong?</p>
        <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: The company&rsquo;s external accountants prepared  annual accounts for each of the three years concerned, and the deficit was  reported inadequately in those statements. There are questions about whether  the accounting standards, practices and policies adopted by the external  accountants were accepted standards, practices and policies in some instances.  Indeed, some of those questions could not be answered in the review without  having access to the accountants&rsquo; working papers, and, on the basis of legal  advice, the auditors have refused access to those papers. Such access may have  provided answers to some of the questions that have arisen.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The issue is being referred to the Department of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment, which has the power, under companies  legislation, to investigate such matters. However, it is a matter of concern  that the company got an unqualified clean bill of health from the auditors.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brolly</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. We have been focusing on finances  and their use, but will the Minister consider initiating a full investigation  of the behaviour of everyone in the Events Company, including how contracts  were meted out and how events promoters were dealt with? I am aware of one case  in which a promoter of one important event is severely aggrieved and feels  discriminated against. I am not sure where the discrimination came from, but  the promoter is very aggrieved by the treatment received and has suffered  serious financial loss as a consequence. I am still dealing with that case.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I am aware of similar cases. Ultimately, the  Department&rsquo;s responsibility is to identify the financial loss to the public and  how that happened. The Department must also identify whether there is potential  to seek redress for the loss or to go to the Public Prosecution Service and  bring about an appearance before the courts. Those are all important steps.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Many people will have grievances with the Events Company. I  am not sure whether those grievances can ever be satisfied, but we must focus  on what is deliverable.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  My question is similar to that of Dominic Bradley. I thank the Minister for his  comprehensive statement, and for going into such detail. I recognise that there  are certain things that he cannot discuss at this stage, but he did say that  KPMG estimated the financial deficit to be &pound;1&middot;6 million by 31 March 2008. He  went on to say that the deficit has accumulated since 31 March 2005, when it  was close to &pound;500,000. What was the deficit at 31 March 2006?</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Although the situation did not occur during his time as  Minister, I am sure that he shares our concerns that the matter was not been  dealt with long before now. When does he envisage a final investigation and  completion of the report? It is in the interests of the Assembly and, indeed,  the general public that this matter is concluded quickly and to the  satisfaction of everyone concerned.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: There is a running total. Therefore, the figures  are available, and I will ascertain them for Lord Morrow.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As I indicated, the deficit was almost entirely related to  the motocross events that were organised latterly by the Northern Ireland  Events Company. As the situation developed, it seemed that the company was  throwing good money after bad. Given the good work that took place over a long  period to bring quality events to Northern   Ireland, it is sad that the organisation of a small  number of events &mdash; and the close association of the Northern Ireland Events Company  with those events &mdash; resulted in so much damage.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>:  The House will be interested to hear that a company of consultants has  circulated a flyer boasting that one of its directors is the former chief  executive of the Northern Ireland Events Company. The Northern Ireland Tourist  Board &mdash; with whom the company has recently secured a contract &mdash; is listed among  its clients. Given those facts, will the Minister inform the House about the  role that the chief executive of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board played in  the Northern Ireland Events Company? Given the continuing connection that  exists, can Members have any confidence that the Northern Ireland Tourist Board  would be able to fulfil the responsibilities of that important role?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: Mr Alan Clarke was appointed to the Northern  Ireland Events Company on 6 June 2002; he is also chief executive of the  Northern Ireland Tourist Board. The role of the directors of the board is in  the public domain, and I have reiterated that the board did not carry out its  functions to the standards expected. Although I do not want to pre-empt any  Public Accounts Committee investigation, I will be interested in the results of  such an investigation.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The House will be alarmed that the Northern Ireland Tourist  Board would be prepared to engage with a company in which the former chief  executive of the Northern Ireland Events Company is a director &mdash; particularly  given the fact that the chief executive of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board  is on the board of that company and has a good knowledge of the situation.  Members can draw their own conclusions, but the matter will not go away. The  Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment and I will have to consider the  issue when then the proposed transfer to the Northern Ireland Tourist Board  takes place.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  share other Members&rsquo; concerns about the deficit of &pound;1&middot;6 million to the public  purse. The Minister&rsquo;s statement suggested that the board might have been  unaware of the company&rsquo;s true financial position. How is that possible?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: The board appears to have failed to meet the  requirements of public accountability as laid out in the management statement,  financial memorandum and companies&rsquo; legislation. Furthermore, the board appears  to have delegated substantial authority to the former chief  executive/accounting officer and, indeed, to the former acting chief  executive/accounting officer, with a lack of adequate controls, such as the  requirement to establish an audit committee and internal audit programme.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The financial controls and procedures were inadequate, and  that contributed significantly to the board&rsquo;s lack of awareness of the  developing problems. The board relied on the chief executive, DCAL and external  auditors to provide support in those areas. However, the fundamentally weak  control environment was the responsibility of the board and the accounting  officer under the provisions of the management statement and financial  memorandum, and under companies&rsquo; legislation.</p>

        <p class="H4StageHeading">Consideration Stage</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: One amendment has been tabled. Members will have received a copy  of the Marshalled List of amendments, which provides details of the amendment.  The amendment deals with the powers to make statutory rules. I remind Members  who intend to speak that they should address their comments only to the  amendment. The Questions on stand part will be taken at the appropriate points  of the Bill. If that is clear, we will proceed.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Clauses 1 to 11 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Clause 12 (Commencement)</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development (Ms Ritchie)</strong>: I beg to move the following amendment: In  page 6, line 38, at end insert</p>
        <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;(2) An order under subsection (1) may include such  transitional provision or savings as the Department considers necessary or expedient  in connection with bringing any provision of the Act into operation.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 12 allows the provisions of the Bill to be brought  into operation by commencement Orders, except clauses 12 and 13, which will  come in to operation upon the granting of Royal Assent. This is a technical  amend&shy;ment to clause 12 of the Bill, and does not introduce any change in  policy. It will enable the Department for Social Development to include, where  it is considered necessary or expedient, transitional provision or savings in  commencement Orders made under that clause. It will ensure that the Department  for Social Development will be able to legislate on the same basis as the  Secretary of State for Work and Pensions under corresponding provisions in the  Westminster Bill.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development (Mr Campbell)</strong>: I thank the Minister  for her explanation of the amendment. As Chairperson of the Social Development  Committee, I will take the opportunity to say a few words about the Bill and  the Committee&rsquo;s scrutiny of it during its Committee Stage.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The overall aim of the Bill is to introduce an integrated system  of registration and regulation, as well as super&shy;vision and support, of  registered charities. In particular, the Bill will provide a definition of  &ldquo;charity&rdquo; and &ldquo;charitable purpose&rdquo;. It will establish &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I apologise; I am on the wrong Bill. I will take my seat.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I will call you again, Mr Campbell, as the Chairperson of the  Committee for Social Development.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development</strong>: I apologise for my mistake, Mr  Deputy Speaker. We are dealing with the Charities Bill as well as the  Mesothelioma, etc., Bill today.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee examined the issue of mesothelioma for some  considerable time, and has no objections or issues to raise in connection with  the Bill. A considerable volume of representations were made about  mesothelioma, but, again, no issues have been raised in connection with the  Bill.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I concur with Mr Campbell. In the  past two days, however, two queries have come to light in relation to the Bill,  which, I am sure, the Minister will be able to deal with briefly. The first was  about whether it had to be definitively proven that an individual had  contracted mesothelioma in order that compensation could be paid. The second  query was about savings, which could be affected by the amendment.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The award of compensation over a certain amount to a person  receiving income support or pension credit may have an impact on that person&rsquo;s  future entitlement to benefit. That situation may only affect a small number of  people, but it does seem to be a contradiction in terms that a person who  receives compensation intended to alleviate suffering in the final period of  his or her life because of mesothelioma may, in fact, be caused a degree of  stress if their benefits, and those of their dependants, are affected. Go raibh  maith agat.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Will the Minister assure the House &mdash; because it is an important public matter &mdash;  that the bureaucracy involved in administering the funds will be so limited as  to easily facilitate those who are afflicted by that terrible condition and to  enable payments to be made easily and in a timely fashion?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>: I  welcome the legislation. Almost 10 years ago, the late Mr Robbie Brown from  Carrickfergus founded the organisation, Justice for Asbestos Victims. That  prompted me, together with the late Mr John Kelly, to propose a debate on the  subject in the Assembly.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">At around that time, the Department of Enterprise, Trade  and Investment set aside a sum to compensate former employees of Harland and  Wolff who had contracted the disease while working for that company before  privatisation. Will such compensation be affected by the legislation, and, if  so, how will it be affected?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  I welcome the legislation. My question has already been asked, so I will not  use up the House&rsquo;s time by repeating it.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Committee members for their support, I am  grateful for it. I am also grateful that, across the Assembly, there has been a  positive approach to the legislation.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As I made clear, the amendment is purely technical and does  not involve a change of policy. Savings provisions are used for a variety of  purposes; for example, to preserve existing law or to make clear that existing  rights are not affected by new legislation. Transitional provisions are used to  make special provision for the application of the legislation to the  circumstances that exist when the legislation comes into operation.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to address the issues that Members raised. Mickey  Brady asked about the eligibility test. A simple medical diagnosis by the  person&rsquo;s general practitioner or local doctor is all that is required to prove  eligibility.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The lump sum is disregarded for 52 weeks in respect of  claims for income support and housing benefit, and it is disregarded  indefinitely in respect of state pension credit. Members will recall that when  I discussed the legislation at its Second Stage last week, I said that the disease  had a long gestation period, and, once diagnosed, sufferers had a short life  expectancy. Unfortunately and sadly, that life expectancy is about nine months.  If a person happens to live longer than 52 weeks, and his or her GP indicates  that that is likely to be the case, the money can be protected by placing it in  a trust fund.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I assure Sean Neeson that the lump sum that is guaranteed  by the Bill will not affect other forms of compensation. It may be recovered  from subsequent compensation; however, that will not affect the claimant per  se.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague Mr Maginness raised general issues, and asked  me to assure the House that all payments will be made in a timely, ordered and  expeditious fashion. I wish to reassure the House, and the general public  throughout Northern Ireland,  that my Department has geared itself up to implement the Bill on enactment.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is most important to me, my officials, people who are deeply  affected by mesothelioma and their families that bureaucracy must not prevent  or hold up the expeditious payment of such bills. The aim of the legislation is  to have a simple benefit, paid within weeks of medical diagnosis, and that  diagnosis is the sole eligibility requirement. I assure those people who have  been in contact with MLAs during the past few days that that is the case.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I will make absolutely sure that that work is carried out  upon enactment and implementation of the Bill. Anyone who has been affected by  mesothelioma, or who has a family member who has been affected, should contact  my officials immediately. That will ensure that cases can be fully investigated  and that payments can be made in an expeditious manner to help those affected  by this vexatious and sad issue.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Amendment agreed to.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Clause 12, as amended, ordered to stand part of the  Bill.</p>

        <p class="H4StageHeading">Consideration Stage</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Members will have a copy of the Marshalled List of amendments  detailing the order for consideration. The amendments have been grouped for  debate in my provisional grouping of amendments selected list.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There are four groups of amendments, and we will debate the  amendments in each group in turn. The first debate will be on amendments No 1  and No 2, which deal with issues relating to the public-benefit test. The  second debate will be on amendments No 3, No 42, No 43 and No 44, which deal  with the designation of religious charities and other religious matters. The  third debate will be on 57 technical amendments. These amendments deal with  changes to company law, auditing and accounting matters, and other technical  changes, together with the opposition of the Minister, for technical reasons,  to clauses 52, 104 and 159. The fourth debate will be on amendments No 38, No  39 and No 40, which deal with the level of financial thresholds applying to  charities.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I remind Members intending to speak that, during the  debates on the four groups of amendments, they should address all the amendments  in each particular group on which they wish to comment.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Once the initial debate on each group is completed, any  subsequent amendments in the group will be moved formally as we go through the  Bill, and the Question on each will be put without further debate. The  Questions on stand part will be taken at the appropriate points in the Bill. If  that is clear, we shall proceed.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Clause 2 (Meaning of &ldquo;charitable purpose&rdquo;)</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I beg to move amendment No 1: In page 2, line 29, after  &ldquo;belief in&rdquo; insert &ldquo;one god or&rdquo;.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The following amendment stood on the Marshalled List:</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">No 2: In clause 3, page 3, line 41, leave out &ldquo;disbenefit&rdquo;  and insert &ldquo;detriment&rdquo;. &mdash; <span class="Italic">[The Minister for Social  Development (Ms Ritchie).]</span></p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: It is helpful that the 66 amendments are grouped in  this way. It should help to ensure a more coherent debate and make the best use  of Assembly time. All the amendments that stand in my name have been discussed  in detail during the Committee for Social Development&rsquo;s clause-by-clause  scrutiny of the Bill. I am pleased that the Committee was able to reach  consensus on all 66 amendments, and I thank its Chairperson and members for  their diligence and patience in dealing with such a substantial Bill.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There are two amendments in this group, and they relate to  the meaning of &ldquo;charitable purpose&rdquo; and the &ldquo;&lsquo;public benefit&rsquo; test&rdquo;. Amendment  No 1, to clause 2, will allow for a better explanation of the broad definition of  &ldquo;the advancement of religion&rdquo; as a charitable purpose. Amendment No 2 will  replace the word &ldquo;disbenefit&rdquo; with &ldquo;detriment&rdquo; in clause 3, when determining  whether a public benefit has been provided. That amendment should ensure a  better understanding of the &ldquo;public benefit&rdquo; test. It also reflects the wording  used in recent guidance that the Charity Commission for England and Wales issued.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development (Mr Campbell)</strong>: I believe in being  far-sighted, but I was probably too far-sighted today. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister for her explanation of the amendments,  which have been helpfully grouped.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I take this opportunity to say a few words about the Bill,  and the Committee&rsquo;s scrutiny of it. The Bill&rsquo;s overall aim is to introduce an  integrated system of registration and regulation, as well as supervision and  support of charities. The Bill provides a definition of &ldquo;charity&rdquo; and  &ldquo;charitable purpose&rdquo;. It will also establish a charity commission for Northern Ireland and a charity tribunal for Northern Ireland.  It will create a register of charities, provide for a new form of charitable  body &mdash; the charitable incorporated organisation &mdash; and deal with the regulation  of charities and public charitable collections.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We need to create a modern legal framework to support and  encourage a vibrant and diverse third sector, which plays such an important  role in the lives of people in Northern    Ireland. It provides vital services,  strengthens communities and is often a powerful advocate for the marginalised.  For a considerable time, the third sector has called for reform of charity law.  It wants registration, regulation, supervision and support of charities. The  public also want regulation that will protect them from bogus charities and associated  fraudulent or criminal activity. The Committee believes that the Bill will  provide all those measures.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The establishment of a charity commission is particularly  welcome. The commission will have both an advisory and regulatory role. At all  times, it should pay particular attention to its duty to regulate fairly and  proportionately. It is of utmost importance that, where possible, bureaucracy  be minimised and charities not hindered from carrying out their work because of  an unnecessary bureaucratic burden.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill&rsquo;s Committee Stage commenced on 16 January, and the  Committee conducted a detailed scrutiny of it. As a result, several amendments  were proposed. The Committee and the departmental officials established from  the start a good working relationship, which paid dividends when it came to  agreeing amendments. On behalf of the Committee, I thank the Minister for  agreeing to table the amendments that Committee members proposed. I also wish  to put on record the Committee&rsquo;s thanks and appreciation to all the Committee  staff and departmental officials for their commitment and assistance during the  Committee&rsquo;s scrutiny of the Bill.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee considered the Bill and related issues at 15  meetings between 31 May 2007 and 1 May 2008. During the Committee Stage, 53  written submissions on the Bill were received, and the Committee took oral  evidence from 12 organisations. The Committee is grateful to those who gave  oral or written evidence; it is of the utmost importance that, as a legislative  Assembly, we take on board the views of those whom new legislation will affect.  Listening to the views of those directly involved is essential if we are to  develop and introduce better policy.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill also introduces enabling powers to make  regulations in a number of areas, including annual statements of accounts,  annual reports and annual returns by charities. The Committee looks forward to  receiving and scrutinising the policy proposals for those regulations, and it  is hoped that our dealings with the Department on forthcoming regulations will  be as productive and positive as they have been on the Bill.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister outlined the nature and purpose of the first  group of amendments, which relate to public benefits, and I do not intend to  cover the same ground. Amendment No 1 is intended to give clarity to the  definition of religion. The Committee was content that the definition of  religion recognised a variety of faith groups in respect of the advancement of  religion. However, it was concerned that the definition, as drafted, did not  specifically include a &ldquo;belief in one god&rdquo;, although it accepted that it did  not preclude it. For the sake of clarity, the Committee decided that the  definition of religion should state that it includes a &ldquo;belief in one god&rdquo;.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee was also concerned about the use of the word  &ldquo;disbenefit&rdquo; in relation to the public benefit test, hence amendment No 2.  Members accepted that the word &ldquo;disbenefit&rdquo; was ambiguous, ill defined and  vulnerable to exploitation. The Committee noted that it was not used in the  public benefit guidance issued by the Charity Commission for England and  Wales &mdash; &ldquo;harm&rdquo; and &ldquo;detriment&rdquo; were used instead. The Committee agreed that  clear, unequivocal and accepted language should be used, and recommended that &ldquo;detriment&rdquo;  replace &ldquo;disbenefit&rdquo;.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">One important concern was highlighted by consultees about  the public-benefit test, and, more specifically, about what constitutes public  benefit. In response to that concern, the Committee emphasises the need for  benefits that are not tangible or measurable &mdash; such as spiritual benefits &mdash; to  be recognised by the commission in determining whether a charitable purpose is  for public benefit. The Committee considered that it was not necessary to table  an amendment to that effect. However, it intends to scrutinise carefully the  proposed guidelines on public benefit to ensure that spiritual benefits are  accepted and recognised by the new charity commission as constituting public  benefit. The Committee supports the first group of amendments.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for her  explanation of the amendments. I will address amendment No 2 and amendment No  3. There was much discussion about the use of &ldquo;disbenefit&rdquo;, because it did not  make sense to a lot of people &mdash; in fact, I had never heard the word before. The  Committee decided that &ldquo;detriment&rdquo; was a more appropriate word to use in the  legislation.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">A lot of evidence was taken from religious groups, and  there was a misapprehension among those groups that their charitable status  would be affected. Amendment No 3 has reassured people. Although it may not  satisfy all of the people concerned, it is hoped that it will satisfy the  majority of those people who had reservations about the criteria that  designated religious charities are expected to meet.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Committee and everyone else who was involved in  the progression of the Bill, because it has been a long and arduous process.  The Bill has 186 clauses and nine schedules, so the Committee had a lot of work  to do. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cobain</strong>: I  support the Bill and the first group of amendments. The Charities Bill is  welcome and necessary. The legislation covering the regulation of charities in Northern Ireland is out of step with that of our  British counterparts and with the new charity law that is being introduced in  the Republic of Ireland. The Charities Bill will bring Northern Ireland  up to speed.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The people of Northern Ireland are generous and supportive  of charities, and we have an excellent charity sector that supports some of the  most vulnerable people in society and further afield. However, to date, the  charity sector has been regulated by a disjointed and often complicated  legislative framework that, in many ways, has been ineffectual for the  charities and for the public&rsquo;s confidence in how charities are run. I am  pleased, therefore, that the Bill introduces a regulatory framework that, while  mirroring many aspects of our British counterparts, is moulded to the  distinctive circumstances of Northern    Ireland.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As has been stated, the Bill provides for a statutory  definition of &ldquo;charity&rdquo; and &ldquo;charitable purposes&rdquo;, the establishment of the  charity commission for Northern Ireland, a new charitable incorporated  organisation, a register of charities, and provisions to deal with the regulation  of charities and public charitable collections.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">One of the main purposes of the Bill is to give the public  confidence that charities are legal and that the money that those charities  receive is used correctly and has been collected properly. Good regulation is  crucial for ensuring that legitimate and successful charities are given the  protection and support that they need; consequently, the thrust of the Bill has  been widely supported by the charity sector. Equally, we must ensure that  unscrupulous people, who, in the past, have used the cover of a charitable  label to promote illegal activities and collect money for illegal  organisations, no longer have the opportunity to do that. I believe that the Bill  represents a necessary and modernising step that will see Northern Ireland  join the twenty-first century in respect of charity regulation.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee Stage has proceeded extremely well. I thank  the Minister and all those who made representations in an attempt to improve  the Bill. As the Minister has clearly outlined, the first group of amendments  deals with the definition of &ldquo;charity&rdquo; and the issue of a public-benefit test.  At present, there is no statutory definition of &ldquo;charity&rdquo; in Northern Ireland,  although the legal concept has been developed through case law for many years.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 1 is intended to clarify that the advancement  of a religion involves the &ldquo;belief in one god&rdquo;, as well as a belief in more  than one god.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill sets out the meaning of &ldquo;charity&rdquo; and the meaning  of &ldquo;charitable purpose&rdquo;. Although most charitable groups have been strongly  supportive of that move, the Committee received representation from religious  groups and groups representing Churches, who raised concerns about the definition  of a religion and the use of the public-benefit test. Therefore, amendment No 2  refers to the public-benefit test in clause 3 of the Bill.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">According to the original version of the Bill, if a charity  is considered to impose disbenefit on the public, that organisation may not  gain charitable status. The Committee considered that the word &ldquo;disbenefit&rdquo; was  too elusive, and could be used against charities whose benefit to society  cannot be measured so tangibly, such as spiritual benefit. By tabling this  amendment, the Minister has sought to give more legal clarity and assurance to  charities that the work that they do cannot be attacked unnecessarily. The  removal of the word &ldquo;disbenefit&rdquo; and the introduction of &ldquo;detriment&rdquo; will  ensure that no legitimate charities are unnecessarily penalised for the work  that they carry out. I support amendments Nos 1 and 2.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her work in respect of the Bill, as well as the  Committee for Social Development, whose work was particularly well done, and  the staff of that Committee, who worked very well in support of Committee  members.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">This Bill brings much clarity to the legal concept of  charitable purpose. This is a timely reform of our law, which has significantly  fallen behind the rest of charity law in both Britain  and the Republic   of Ireland. Clause 2  includes an exhaustive list describing charitable purposes, which I believe  reflects contemporary interests and contemporary charitable objectives.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 1, proposing the insertion of &ldquo;one god or&rdquo;  into clause 2, is not, perhaps, absolutely essential. Nonetheless,  representatives of the Presbyterian Church, as well as others, raised the issue  that we live in a theistic society, where the concept of there being one God is  deeply valued. It is fit and proper, therefore, that that should be reflected  in the legislation that will govern charitable purpose, particularly given that  many people who are involved in charities are motivated by religious purpose.  Therefore, it is fit and proper that that amendment be made, and we are  grateful to those religious bodies &mdash; in particular, the Presbyterian Church &mdash;  for bringing that issue to the attention of the Committee and the Assembly.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is proper that amendment No 2 be passed, because the  term &ldquo;disbenefit&rdquo; is vague and lacks proper definition; the amendment will  bring clarity to clause 3. Although the term &ldquo;harm&rdquo; emerged as an alternative  during the Committee&rsquo;s discussions, &ldquo;detriment&rdquo; is the most appropriate term  and reflects the views of the bodies that gave evidence to the Committee. Those  bodies were concerned about the use of the term, &ldquo;disbenefit&rdquo;.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As the Chairperson correctly said, the term &ldquo;disbenefit&rdquo;  jars and does not bring any meaning or feeling to the legislation. In the  corresponding legislation in England  and Wales,  the terms &ldquo;harm&rdquo; and &ldquo;detriment&rdquo; are used &mdash; we should use language that is  common to other jurisdictions to make our law easily understandable in the  context of modern charity law.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As part of the public-benefit test, which is essential to  establishing a charitable purpose, it was proper that the Committee decided  that spiritual value is as legitimate a purpose as any of the more tangible  charitable purposes. It was important and correct that Church bodies and other  organisations stressed that point. When the commission determines public  benefit, I hope that it takes seriously the points that were made by the  organisations that gave evidence &mdash; there is a non-tangible spiritual value that  is appreciated by people who live in this jurisdiction, and it should be part  and parcel of the determination of charitable purpose.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I am grateful for Members&rsquo; contributions to the debate  on the amendments in group 1. As I said earlier, the amendments have been  agreed by the Committee and will improve the understanding of the  public-benefit test.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I assure the Chairperson, Mr Campbell, and all the members  of the Committee that the good working relationship and the communication that  was established between the Committee and the Department will continue as we  work through the implementation of the Bill, namely with the charity  commission. I assure the House that the charity commission will come back with  consultation on the terms of the public-benefit test.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The public-benefit test is an important part of the new  legislation, and the proposed charity commission will have to consult on its  guidance for the application of that test. All charities that register with the  charity commission will have to demonstrate that they provide public benefit.  However, the vast majority of charities currently registered with HM Revenue  and Customs for tax purposes will be able to pass that test.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Cobain discussed the need to have a proper regulatory  framework that is in line with what exists in Great Britain. I welcome those  supportive comments. My Department has been working with other regulators in Great Britain and in Ireland to ensure the proper  regulation of all charities, hence the need for the legislation.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague Mr Maginness raised the issue of spiritual  benefit, to which Mr Cobain referred already. I stress that there will be full  regulation and full recognition of that issue, and that is why I accepted the  Committee&rsquo;s proposed amendments on the matter. I also had several meetings with  various bodies about their particular concerns. I was charged and compelled by  their comments.</p>

        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: The above amendments deal with religious issues. My  Department and the Committee for Social Development received a considerable  number of representations on the issue of designated religious charity status.  That status was introduced in clauses 165 and 166 in recognition of the unique  governance arrangements that exist in many of our faith-based organisations.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is intended that those clauses will provide limited exemptions  from aspects of the Charities Bill for faith-based charities that meet the  criteria for designated religious status. I have listened to the concerns of  Committee members, smaller Churches and ethnic minority groups about the  proposed criteria that are to be applied. It is recognised that many such  organisations also have robust internal governance arrangements. I am pleased  that the proposed amendments to the criteria that are to be applied have been  agreed with the Committee for Social Development and by the Executive.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 3 relates to the registration of charities and  will extend to clause 16 to include a separate statement to reflect whether a  charity has been granted designated religious status. Amendment No 42 to clause  165 will ensure that any subsequent Order made by the Department to extend  exemptions to charities must be approved by resolution of the Assembly.  Amendment No 43 will reduce the qualifying criteria for designated religious  status in clause 166(3)(c) from 10 years to five years.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">That is a reasonable concession that will ensure that new  faith-based charities have sufficient time to demonstrate that acceptable  governance arrangements are in place.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 44 will remove the membership criteria for  designated religious status in clause 166(d). That membership criterion  previously stood at 1,000 members. However, I accepted that that would  disadvantage smaller faith-based organisations. In clause 166, the underlying  principle remains that it will be a matter for the charity commission to  determine whether designated religious status is appropriate in each case.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: As  a member of the Committee for Social Development, I welcome the Charities Bill,  which will introduce an integrated system of registration and regulation,  including control of charitable fund-raising as well as supervision and support  of registered charities. It is good that, for the first time, we will have  effective regulation and a statutory definition of charities in Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">When considering these amendments &mdash; especially amendment No  43, which refers to clause 166(c) &mdash; all members of the Committee understood why  it was necessary to have a clause that stated that religious organisations had  to be established for 10 years before meeting the religious designation  criteria. We all understood the principle; nobody wanted a situation in which  an organisation could set itself up, claiming to be religious, and could  disappear overnight with people&rsquo;s money. Unfortunately, Northern Ireland  has a history of that happening.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">All Committee members clearly understood why a period of  time was included in that clause, but we felt that a decade was too long for  some organisations and Churches to be established before meeting the religious  designation criteria. We suggested that five years was a more suitable period  of time. I thank the Committee and the Minister for coming to an agreement on  the five-year period, which we all believe is much more reasonable.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">That five-year period will still protect the public,  because I do not believe that an illegal organisation would set itself up for  five years, call itself a religious organisation or Church, and disappear with  people&rsquo;s money; most unscrupulous people do not have that sort of patience.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee was bemused when clause 166(d) was  considered. It stated that a Church must have 1,000 members before it meets the  religious designation criteria. Perhaps I am bemused because I am a  third-generation Baptist who was brought up in a small Church that fiercely  protects its independence as a denomination.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">When I mentioned independent and congregation-based Churches,  many Committee members were bewildered because they were not brought up in that  type of background. Northern    Ireland has hundreds &mdash; if not thousands &mdash; of  independent Churches, and few, if any, would have met that criterion of having  1,000 congregation members. Unfortunately, that would have automatically  excluded those Churches from religious designation protection.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Once the arguments were clearly put to Committee members,  not only did they accept them but members asked many of the independent  Churches to make their views known, for which I thank the members. Many  independent Churches went to the effort and bother of submitting their views to  the Committee, for which they are to be thanked. Those views gave the Committee  and the Minister a better understanding of the organisations&rsquo; perspective on  the issue.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Committee for accepting those arguments and,  ultimately, I thank the Minister for accepting them through the Committee.  Furthermore, I thank her for the removal of the denominational number  requirement. The proposed charities commission will make the decision on a  church-by-church basis, and I accept that. Many churches would have been  discriminated against, had that amendment not been accepted. I accept and  endorse the amendments.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  If anyone wants to see the value of the Committee system working in the  Assembly, I refer them to the second group of amendments. That reflects the  sympathy and concern given to the groups that attended the Committee to give  evidence on the issue of designated religious charity status. The deep concerns  of those groups were felt by the Committee and, as a result, the Committee was  so concerned that it made it plain to the Department and the Minister that  amendments were necessary.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Craig detailed the concerns expressed by independent  Church groups. It was appropriate for the Committee to take those concerns on  board, and it did so by reducing the 10 years to five years, and by removing  the necessity for 1,000 members as a criterion for achieving designated  religious charitable status. That, of course, is not to say that the Committee  did not have thorough discussion on the matter: it did. However, it reached a  consensus, and that is important.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Church groups that had problems must feel satisfied that  they not only had the opportunity to make their points, but that their points  were considered thoroughly, and taken on board by the Committee, the Department  and the Minister, and, I hope, by the Assembly today.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  endorse what the previous two Members have said on this group of amendments,  and I support the amendments. I was one of the Committee members who advocated  a change in clause 165.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I particularly thank the Minister for her understanding,  for giving time to meet ethnic minority communities, and for asking her staff  to meet those groups. On behalf of the ethnic minority community sector, I  thank and congratulate the Minister on agreeing to make the amendments. When  the ethnic minority sector first heard about the criterion for 1,000 members,  they felt that it would be totally discriminatory to them. Those small faith  groups will, in their nature, remain very small and will never meet a criterion  of 1,000 members. They would have been barred for ever from obtaining the  designated religious status. They understood that to get that designated  religious status exempted them from only a few clauses; however, to them it was  a matter of principle. Why should they, as religious faith groups, be barred  from obtaining charitable status?</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Any group that is founded on faith or religion wants to  receive designated religious charity status.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The ethnic-minority sector viewed the criterion for a group  to have been established for at least 10 years before acquiring religious  status as extremely difficult to meet and disadvantageous, particularly to  newer immigrants to Northern Ireland. I am extremely pleased that the 10-year  period has been reduced to a more reasonable five years and that the  requirement for 1,000 members has been removed from the Bill.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I support the amendment, and I thank the Minister, the  staff and the Committee members, who also support the amendment.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  I echo my colleague Mr Craig in thanking the Minister for tabling the  amendments to clauses 16, 165 and 166, and I fully support their inclusion in  the Bill. The clauses vexed both Committee members and a wide variety of  congregations and, needless to say, caused a certain amount of confusion and  concern. It is important that the register of charities clearly identifies  whether a charity has designated religious charity status, and the insertion of  clause 16(4)(b) helps to draw attention to that distinction.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland is peculiar in the number and size  of its religious denominations. I welcome the reduction of the 10-year  requirement to five years. I also welcome the removal of the requirement for  1,000 members because, as the Minister said, that may have caused disadvantage  to some. I am happy to support the amendments.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank all Members for contributing to the debate and  raising questions and issues on the second group of amendments. Those  amendments arose out of representations from faith-based organisations during  the Committee&rsquo;s Consideration Stage, and I was content to table them.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I want to make it clear that any applications for  designated religious charity status will be a matter for the new charity  commission to consider, but only after a faith-based charity has been  registered. The commission will require assurance that charities seeking the  exemption have the appropriate governance arrangements in place. Any  faith-based organisation will still be able to register as a charity without  seeking designated religious status, which is neither a requirement nor  automatically granted.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome Mr Craig&rsquo;s supportive comments, and I assure him  that the charity commission will be diligent in protecting legitimate charities  and the public from criminal activity. I place that assurance on the record  while on the Floor of the House.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">My officials and I met several of the main and minority Churches  to discuss the criteria for designated religious status. I listened to their  concerns and to those of the Committee, and I am pleased to have accepted the amendment.  I found meeting all those Church represent&shy;atives a valuable and enriching  experience, because it provided me with information of which I had hitherto  been unaware and that I was pleased to receive.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Anna Lo talked about minority faith and ethnic groups, and  I am aware of the increasingly important role that they play in society,  particularly over the past number of years. I was pleased to table the  amendment.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague Alban Maginness made a largely political  point, but he also underscored the value of the Committee process and the  benefit of positive engagement with the smaller Churches. The fundamental value  of the Committee process is in ensuring members&rsquo; full participation in the  line-by-line scrutiny of the Bill and their full engagement with my officials  in understanding, commenting on and providing reasoned amendments to, the  legislation.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I agree that it was a very worthwhile and necessary  process, and we have seen the benefits of it in the amendments tabled. It  demonstrates very clearly to me, and I am sure to all Members of the House,  that democracy is working in Northern    Ireland and working well for all of the  people.</p>

        <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister for Social Development: The amendments in  this group are almost entirely of a very technical nature, and none in any way  undermines the policy intention of the Bill; to provide for proper regulation  of the charitable sector. The proposed technical amendments fall into three  distinct categories. The first category will ensure that parity is maintained  following very recent changes to charity and company law in Great Britain.  The second category will correct a number of drafting errors in the Bill, and  the final category will update some statutory references.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I do not intend to take up Assembly time by providing  detailed explanation of those technical amendments. That information was  provided to the members of the Committee for Social Development, and I am  grateful to them for agreeing to the amendments.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In addition to the technical amendments, this group  contains three clauses that I wish to oppose in the Bill. Some issues came to  light during the Committee Stage of the Bill, and it was agreed that those  clauses should not stand as part of the Bill. Clause 52 contains provision that  the Charity Commission may order taxation of a solicitor&rsquo;s bill of costs for  business conducted on behalf of a charity. Advice was received from the Office  of Legislative Counsel that that clause duplicated provision contained in the  Solicitors (Northern Ireland)  Order 1976, and is therefore unnecessary.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 104 relates to the annual audit or examination of  accounts of charitable companies. That raises a technical issue arising from  the enactment of the Companies Act 2006, and the reference to the Companies (Northern Ireland)  Order 1986 in the clause is no longer appropriate.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 159 relates to the power of my Department to give  financial assistance to charitable, benevolent or philanthropic institutions.  It is proposed to remove that clause from the Bill, on the basis that it  duplicates provision contained in the Social Need (Northern Ireland) Order 1986.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">For those reasons, I request that Members oppose clauses  52, 104 and 159 and support the other technical amendments to the Bill.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Social Development (Mr Hilditch)</strong>: I thank  the Minister for her explanation of the amendments and her reasons for opposing  certain clauses in the Bill. The vast majority of the technical amendments are  necessary to reflect the recent changes that have been made to company law.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The others simply correct minor typographical or drafting  errors in the Bill. It is important to note that they do not have any policy  impact on the operation of the charity commission. The Committee supports fully  the amendments and the Minister&rsquo;s proposal to remove certain clauses from the  Bill.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister for Social Development: I am grateful for  Mr Hilditch&rsquo;s contribution on those technical amendments. As I made it clear  earlier, they do not in any way dilute the overall policy directive to provide for  effective and proportionate regulation of the charitable sector in Northern  Ireland.</p>

        <p class="B3BodyText">This group of three amendments deals with some financial  issues that arise from clause 122, which provides powers for the transfer of  property belonging to unincorporated charities. The Charity Commission for England and Wales contacted the Social  Development Committee to suggest the introduction of a deregulatory measure  that deals with the transfer of designated land. Officials from my Department  have discussed this matter with the Office of the Third Sector in London and agreed that  there was merit in the suggestion. Amendment Nos 38, 39 and 40 to clause 122  will allow for the transfer of designated land of a low value, where the  charity commission is assured that the land will continue to be used for the  specific purposes on which it is held in trust.</p>        
        <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 38 will introduce a low-value threshold of  &pound;90,000, which aligns to the threshold for small charities in the Charities  Bill and the Companies Act 2006. Amendment No 39 will make a minor change to  the wording of the clause and amendment No 40 will provide a definition of  market value in relation to any designated land held by a charity. Those  amendments provide for a more reasonable approach to this issue, and I am  thankful to the Charity Commission for England  and Wales  for bringing this matter to the attention of myself and the Committee.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development</strong>: I thank the Minister for her  explanation of the amendments. The amendments provide for an exception for the  transfer of designated land the value of which does not exceed &pound;90,000. In  practical terms, that introduces an exception for the transfer of designated  land that has very low value. Designated land will still be subject to special  safeguards to ensure that it is used for the specific purposes for which it is  held in trust. Therefore the exception will be purely a deregulatory measure  and will avoid expensive and time-consuming cy-pres proceedings. I imagine that  the amendment will be welcomed by all, particularly the smaller charities. On  behalf of the Committee for Social Development, I recommend to the House that  the amendments be made to the Bill.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I am grateful for Mr Hilditch&rsquo;s contribution to this  debate, and the for the Committee&rsquo;s general patience in dealing with some  complex and technical issues.</p>

After talking to the association and to the  Committee Clerk, I did not feel it necessary to propose an amendment, although  that was the wish of the association. Will the Minister give an assurance that  such permits will be open-ended and apply to multiple dates, so that charities  will not be overburdened by having to seek a permit each time a collection is  sought?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Social Development</strong>: As Ms Lo said, the  Association of Charity Shops contacted all Members with regard to possible  amendments to the Bill. The association&rsquo;s main concern relates to the  permitting requirements. Although I have not seen the proposed amendments that  were sent to selected MLAs, I imagine that they are not far off the proposed  amendments that were submitted to the Committee during Committee Stage. I  understand from media reports yesterday that the British Heart Foundation has  expressed similar concerns.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Shannon: I am not sure if I was one of those lucky  ones who got the email from the Association of Charity Shops, but I am sure  that there are many others in the Chamber who received it.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Charity shops feel that it is unfair to ask for a permit  system because house-to-house collections are clearly for the charities  themselves. For some charities, house-to-house collections provide as much as  80% of their income. Has consideration been given to that concern, and to the  fact that professional fundraisers have to make specific statements about what  they do with the money that they collect and for whom it is intended?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for Social  Development: The association got in touch with the Committee during  evidence-gathering sessions in February. Further evidence was presented to the  Committee in April. The Committee considered the association&rsquo;s concerns,  favourable responses that were received on this issue during the consultation  period, and the views of the Department. Hopefully, in the next few sentences,  and perhaps also through the Minister, further assurance will be given with  regard to those issues.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The association wants charity shops to be exempt from  permit requirements. The Committee gave full consideration to the relevant  clauses and was content that there was enough flexibility around the issue of permits  that an amendment to the Bill was not warranted. A charity will be able to  apply for a permit once a year to conduct collections every day of the year.  The task of applying for a yearly blanket permit is not overly onerous. It will  be up to a particular charity to discuss such matters with the commission when  it is established, and I hope that the commission will take a pragmatic  approach when dealing with this issue.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">This legislation is designed not just to regulate and  support charities; but to protect the public from bogus charities and criminal  activity. Throughout its consider&shy;ation of the Bill, the Committee was conscious  of minimising bureaucracy. It is a matter of striking the right balance between  regulation and bureaucracy. The Committee firmly believes that the right  balance has been achieved.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The association also raised concerns about the requirement  for door-to-door collectors to inform the public who will benefit from the  collection, and to provide details on remuneration. The association felt that  that was unworkable. The Committee carefully considered that point, and agreed  that an amendment was not necessary. In fact, after taking into account all  views expressed during the Committee Stage of the Bill, the Committee welcomed  the requirement, as it will allow the public to be more discerning as to whom  they give donations to.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In its letter to MLAs &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Craig: I thank the Member for giving way. There has  been anecdotal evidence &mdash; and proper evidence from the police &mdash; that  unregulated collections have, unfortunately, been used by some unscrupulous people  to line their own pockets instead of for charities.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Member agree that a regulatory system for keeping  a register of organisations that make collections, irrespective of whether they  are charity shops, represents a huge step forward? Furthermore, that is a huge  step forward for the police, and it will build confidence in the community that  collections are legitimate.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for  his intervention. Those are wise words indeed, and they are also the thoughts  of the Committee.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In its letter to Members, the Association of Charity Shops  suggested that the Department misled the Committee on that matter. I strongly  refute those claims, and, once again, thank the Minister and her officials for  their full co-operation and support during the Committee Stage of the Bill.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister for Social Development: I thank Anna Lo,  Jim Shannon, David Hilditch and Jonathan Craig for raising those issues. I,  too, received correspondence from the Association of Charity Shops, and I am  aware that the Committee gave full consideration to the issues during its  clause-by-clause scrutiny of the Bill and concluded that no amendments were  necessary.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The fundamental issue is one of accountability and  transparency in respect of charitable giving. Members will be aware of public  concerns and media coverage on fraudulent door-to-door collections, and it is  important that we protect the public and charities against bogus or  non-charitable collections.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The legislation will ensure that the charity commission is  fully informed about the nature and purpose of all public collections. I am  conscious, however, that we do not wish to impose an unnecessary administrative  burden on charities that are involved in legitimate fund-raising activities. It  is my judgement, and it was supported by the Committee, that there is  sufficient capacity in the legislation to ensure that door-to-door collections  by charity shops are not unduly hindered.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 143 provides for the issue of open-ended permits,  where necessary. That should address the concerns raised by the Association of  Charity Shops. Mr Hilditch was right to say that the issue was raised in the  local media this week by the British Heart Foundation. The foundation claimed  that it would be required to apply for a separate licence for each charity  collection that it makes in Northern    Ireland, which could prove to be a  considerable burden for the organisation. Again, I assure the House that that  will not be the case.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As I have explained, after obtaining the necessary  public-collection certificate, organisations may apply for an open-ended  permit, which would cover a number of public collections. In my view, that  system will achieve a fair and proper balance between the need for proper  accountability and the demands on charities that are involved in fundraising  through public door-to-door collections.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Jim Shannon and David Hilditch raised the issue of  professional fund-raisers being required to make statements. In order to ensure  transparency and proper public accountability, it is important that people are  aware of what percentage of their donation goes to the charitable cause.  Therefore, I assure the House that a statement by the professional or paid  fund-raisers is an important part of regulation.</p>

        <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Deputy Speaker: The Business Committee has agreed to  allow up to one hour and 30 minutes for the debate. The proposer of the motion  will have 10 minutes to propose and 10 minutes to make a winding-up speech. All  other Members who wish to speak will have five minutes.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister for Regional Development (Mr Murphy): I  beg to move</p>
        <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes the content of the Rapid Transit for  Belfast Strategic Outline Case.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I tabled this  motion in order to provide the Assembly with an opportunity to discuss an  exciting and hugely important transport initiative for the city of Belfast. A rapid transit  system for the city &mdash; a modern, new and efficient public transport system &mdash;  will move people quickly around the city, linking communities to jobs, schools,  hospitals, shops and colleges. A rapid transit system will get people out of  their cars and offer a high-quality alternative. It will reduce pollution,  using the most modern technology in order to reduce our carbon footprint.</p>
        <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr McClarty] in the Chair)</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Proposals for a rapid transit system in Belfast have been talked about for many  years, but the time for talking is coming to an end. Rapid transit is one of my  key priorities, and it is a key priority of the Programme for Government. This  devolved Administration will deliver a rapid transit system: so, what is rapid  transit? It is new to us; it is a step change for public transport, providing  faster, higher-quality services, with new routes serving new opportunities,  segregated from other traffic so that congestion is avoided. A rapid transit  system will incorporate high-quality halts with real-time information and a  ticketing system that will enable quick and easy boarding of vehicles.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier this year, I visited several schemes in the Netherlands in  order to understand the concept of rapid transit better. I invited members of  the Committee for Regional Development to join me and was pleased that most of  them did so. We were all impressed at what we saw, and how rapid transit  systems provide quick and efficient access into city centres and a real  alternative to car travel.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Belfast  needs a rapid transit system. The city is the key economic driver of the  region, and all successful regions have strong cities at their core. Strong,  vibrant cities need modern and efficient transport systems. Rapid transit will  improve the city&rsquo;s image and will help to regenerate rundown neighbourhoods and  open up new development opportunities.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">My Department commissioned the consultants Atkins and KPMG  to examine rapid transit systems with a brief to find the best system for Belfast. We did not have  any preconceived ideas &mdash; it was an open brief. We wanted the consultants to  examine the technology, routes, demand and cost, and they looked at light-rail  and bus-based options.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Most Members will be familiar with light rail or tram  systems. We have seen and experienced them in other cities, particularly the  Luas system in Dublin,  which has been very successful in bringing people into the city centre and  getting people out of their cars. However, many of us are less familiar with  bus-based rapid transit technology, which is relatively new and fast evolving.  It has been described to me as a tram on tyres. No track is required, but it is  segregated from other traffic as much as possible; it can also drive on the  street in mixed traffic. It has priority at junctions, and the vehicles can be  powered by diesel or electric hybrid engines.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There are bus-based rapid transit systems across Europe, in  cities such as Amsterdam, Essen  and Edinburgh; they are also being developed in  cities such as Las Vegas, Cambridge,  Swansea, Glasgow  and Leeds. Other Irish cities, including Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford, are investigating the potential of  rapid transit systems, including bus technology. They have recently benefited  from discussions with officials from my Department, sharing experience and  knowledge.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Whatever vehicle technology we choose, the right  infrastructure is crucial. Rapid transit vehicles require high-quality halts or  platforms with level access, real-time information systems and off-vehicle  ticketing systems to speed up the boarding process. The whole package is about  providing a fast, efficient and sustainable system.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Finding the best rapid transit system for Belfast is all about looking at potential  passenger demand, wider regeneration benefits and affordability. The  consultants&rsquo; study found that bus-based rapid transit will produce positive  economic results, but that light rail will not. That is because the likely  number of passengers does not warrant the extra cost of light rail. However,  the consultants concluded that there should be an option of migrating to a  light rail system in future, should demand increase.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The potential cost of a light rail network across the three  routes identified was estimated at &pound;590 million, while a bus-based system would  cost &pound;147 million. The consultants concluded that a light rail system would  attract about 600 more passengers at peak hours than a bus-based system.  However, attracting those 600 passengers would come at a heavy cost. The  consultants&rsquo; analysis suggested that the additional cost of &pound;450 million would  be difficult to justify. They suggested that light rail, if selected, would  carry approximately seven million passengers a year.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">To put that in context, the Luas in Dublin,  which is of a similar size to the proposed Belfast network, carried nearly 29 million  passengers last year. Belfast is a smaller, less  densely populated city than Dublin.  Solutions that are right for Dublin may not  necessarily be right for Belfast.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The feasibility study investigated several potential rapid  transit routes. First, the E-way in east Belfast  was identified in previous studies as a pilot route because of the opportunity  to use the old Belfast  to Dundonald railway line along a significant part of the route and the growing  congestion on the Newtownards Road.  Secondly, the emerging Titanic Quarter with its new jobs, homes, college and  tourism potential must be linked to the rest of the city. A rapid transit  system seems an obvious way to make such links.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, west Belfast houses  one third of the city&rsquo;s population and contains the Royal Victoria   Hospital, which serves  many people in the city and beyond. The emerging Glenmona development site  opens up opportunities for a rapid transit route that would serve west Belfast and link it to  the city centre and beyond.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">All three pilot routes connected together would provide a  network of services that would allow cross-city journeys from Ballybeen to the Royal Victoria   Hospital and from Turf  Lodge to the Titanic Quarter.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Before making any decisions, I wanted to share the  consultants&rsquo; findings, and that is why I published them at the start of April.  I tasked my officials to engage with as many stakeholders as possible.  Developing such a transport system is an important decision for Belfast, and it is right  that all views are heard, understood and considered.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased to report that, so far, there has been broad  support for rapid transit. There was undoubtedly some disappointment that the  consultants recommended that light rail was not the best solution for Belfast. Some of the  comments that I have heard are, &ldquo;Dublin has light  rail, why should Belfast not have it?&rdquo; and, &ldquo;It  is a second-best solution for Belfast.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">None of the options &mdash; bus or rail &mdash; is second best. I want  the best system for Belfast;  one that works for us. That means examining carefully our current and future  needs and matching them to the best technology &mdash; whatever it may be. That is  what we asked the consultants to do.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I am not in the business of wasting taxpayers&rsquo; money on  schemes that are not fit for purpose or of building schemes that will be a  long-term drain on our finances. I am in the business of delivering a  world-class rapid transit system for Belfast  that is fit for purpose and of which we can all be proud.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Since the release of the consultants&rsquo; study, I have  received letters from people who are concerned about the possible loss of the Bloomfield walkway and  cycling path. It might be useful if I tell Members about the history of that  amenity.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In 2003, work was undertaken to build a new sewer along  parts of the old railway line. That presented my Department with an opportunity  to create a walking and cycling route along the corridor while plans for rapid  transit were being progressed. That work was undertaken in the full knowledge  that the line would be used for rapid transit in the future; those involved in  the construction of the walkway understood that.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It was decided that walkers and cyclists should not have to  wait for rapid transit to deliver a walk/cycle route but that an interim  pathway could be built while the rapid transit plans were being developed. I am  conscious of the needs of walkers and cyclists and I am keen to support both. I  intend to retain a walking and cycling amenity on that route. However, I will  further consider the issues that have been raised; my officials are carrying  out that work.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Concerns have been raised about the exclusion of north and  south Belfast  from the project. The proposals are for a pilot network that can be rolled out  to other areas of the city. In the meantime, the needs of those other areas  will not be ignored. More bus lanes, new buses, and park-and-ride sites are  just some of the initiatives that are being developed. If rapid transit is to  be successful, the system must be segregated from other traffic as much as  possible, and given priority over other vehicles at junctions. That will mean  changes to our roads and less road space for cars. I am prepared to take the  difficult decisions that are necessary.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">If we are to introduce rapid transit to Belfast, I want to get it right. I do not  want to do it in a half-hearted manner that is destined to fail. The  introduction of rapid transit cannot be done in isolation &mdash; it must be  integrated with the existing Metro services. Rather than competing with each  other, rapid transit and Metro should work together to serve passengers&rsquo; needs.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The introduction of rapid transit will also mean that we  must do more to encourage people to leave their cars at home rather than bring  them into the city centre. Rapid transit will serve the city centre; therefore,  it is my intention that it will be integrated with the changes occurring in the  city centre.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Rapid transit is one of my top priorities. It is  highlighted as a key priority in the Programme for Government, with a  commitment to start work by 2011. I have secured &pound;111 million for rapid transit  and my Department will continue to explore opportunities to draw in additional  private-sector finance. Some private-sector contributions have already been  secured.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The consultants have made recommendations on how we can  best procure a rapid transit system. If we opt for light rail, a PFI or PPP  method of procurement route is proposed. If a bus-based system is selected, the  consultants recommend that the Department should build the infrastructure and  tender out the operation of the service. That will be further considered as the  project progresses.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">This debate provides an opportunity to hear Members&rsquo; views  on the rapid transit project. I want to benefit from those views before I take  high-level decisions about the technology and broad routes that will be used.  There is a lot of detail that still needs to be addressed. I want to move  forward quickly to establish a dedicated team to deliver this project. That  team will work through the detail quickly and efficiently and report back to me  regularly.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Further decisions will be required on the final detail of  the routes. However, today, I will listen carefully to Members&rsquo; views on the  consultant&rsquo;s report, and on how we can best deliver a rapid transit system for Belfast that we can all  be proud of. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Chairperson of the Committee for Regional  Development (Mr Cobain): The Committee for Regional Development has been  considering the strategic outline case for rapid transit in Belfast since 9 April 2008. Discussions took  place at a number of Committee meetings and members had the opportunity to see  the proposed routes for themselves.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In principle, the Committee supports the development of a  rapid transit system for Belfast.  It would provide economic, social and environmental benefits for the city.  However, the devil is in the detail. Further work is needed on aspects such as  guidance, technology, opportunities for off-road segregation, and the  resolution of city-centre traffic management and on-street parking.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is particularly concerned about how the  Minister will remove cars from the streets of Belfast. That is a prerequisite of any rapid  transit system, and we are interested to see how that programme goes forward.  The Committee urges the Minister to resolve such issues as soon as possible so  that they can be reflected in the preliminary detail, design stage and outline  business case.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee also notes the consultant&rsquo;s evaluation that,  on the basis of projected passenger numbers, Belfast is too small a city to generate  enough passengers for a light rail system to be viable. It is the Committee&rsquo;s  view that any rapid transit system should be built with the future in mind.  Therefore, the necessary physical infrastructure should be put in place now to  ensure that, should circumstances change, the system can be adapted to light  rail.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In the course of its work on rapid transit, the Committee  met executives from rapid transit manufacturers and operators in Northern Ireland and the Netherlands. We  participated in a study of rapid transit systems that are in operation in Amsterdam, Eindhoven and Utrecht, which the  Minister has already mentioned.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In the Committee&rsquo;s view, the key lesson learnt from those  engagements is that in order to maximise passenger numbers and positive  passenger experience and to ensure that social, economic and environmental  benefits accrue from proposed systems, the following element must be  incorporated into any proposed bus-based rapid transit system: the dedicated  rapid transit route must be separated as strictly as possible from other road  users. Mr Wright of Wrightbus Ltd was particularly keen on that: a mixture of  cars and rapid transit buses in the same lane does not work. Where complete  separation cannot be achieved, priority must be accorded a rapid transit  vehicle.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Any proposed rapid transit network must be fully integrated  with other forms of public and private transport, with easy ticketing and  transfers between rapid transit and existing bus, rail and park-and-ride facilities.  It is essential that we have an integrated system that works; people will not  choose public transport unless it is easy and efficient. The Committee&rsquo;s view  is that it must be made so. Where such issues have been addressed, passenger  numbers have risen dramatically: the number of passengers travelling by train,  for example, has risen in response to such improvements.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee also recommends that every possible effort be  made to ensure that the buses chosen should employ green technologies. Jim  Wells made that point. Hybrid diesel-electric, gas electric, or an emerging  fuel-cell technology should all be considered. At Wrightbus, we discussed  hydrogen-cell powered buses, which is an exciting prospect. The Committee urges  the Minister to grasp the opportunity to bring positive environmental benefits  to Belfast that  will go some way towards meeting our carbon emission reduction targets. Present  emissions are appallingly high.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The relationship between land-use strategies and the  development of a rapid transit system is critical. There are opportunities now,  with the review of strategic planning documents such as the &lsquo;Regional  Transportation Strategy for Northern Ireland 2002-2012&rsquo; and the fundamental  review of the &lsquo;Regional Development Strategy for Northern Ireland 2025&rsquo; to  propose a truly integrated infrastructure that will benefit Northern Ireland as  a whole.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Since the publication of the &lsquo;Strategic Outline Case for  Rapid Transit in Belfast&rsquo;, the Committee has had correspondence from residents  who are concerned that the E-way from Belfast city centre to Dundonald will  damage the existing amenity value created by the natural walkway and cycle path  along sections of the old Belfast to Dundonald railway. The Committee&rsquo;s view is  that the Department should continue its engagements with stakeholders and user  groups on the issue, as well as investigating alternative routes for the E-way  corridor. In particular, a more detailed outline business case and design  should be developed.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Regional Development (Mr Wells)</strong>: I  apologise to Members that, on finishing my speech, I will have to move quickly  &mdash; and, unfortunately, by private transport &mdash; to Down District Council for an  important meeting.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in the debate.  The Committee has been fully consulted on the issue. I had the benefit of going  to Amsterdam  twice to look at rapid transit systems. I must emphasise that it was to look at  rapid transit. We have had numerous briefings from departmental officials &mdash; on  one occasion when they were not expecting it. We have been given adequate  information on the issue.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">After much deliberation, we came to the view that, on this  occasion, the right decision was made. <strong>Many  ask why we do not propose an electric rail system</strong>: superficially, it sounds  like a great idea until the economics are investigated. Given the size of the  population of Northern    Ireland and its geography, the figures do  not stack up. An electric rail system would involve four times the capital cost  of a rapid transit bus system. We went to Holland  to compare the same decision-making process being undertaken by similar-sized  cities and towns, and those communities have decided to opt for a rapid transit  system. Properly designed, rapid transit is as good as electric rail.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It runs well where there are dedicated bus routes with  which parked cars or cyclists, for instance, do not interfere. The Committee  wishes the case for a rapid transit system a fair wind; we hope that it is  successful.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As the Committee Chairman, Fred Cobain, said, the  Committee&rsquo;s submission to the Department addresses one or two issues. The  Committee received many submissions from individuals who use the Comber walkway  regularly. Initial concerns among those who use the walkway were that we were  to abolish the entire walkway. That is not true. The Department intends to have  a walkway, which will still stretch the length of the old railway line, and a  rapid transit system.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The quality of walkers&rsquo; experience on that route will in no  way be the same as it is now after the rapid transit system is introduced &mdash;  that is a fact of life. However, it has been possible to achieve both with some  success in cities such as Cambridge.  It is hoped that that will reduce the level of people&rsquo;s concerns, because the  emails that I have seen contain no reference to the fact that the Department  has taken great strides to try to preserve some amenity for the people of east Belfast.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The proposed rapid transit system should not have come as a  surprise to the people who live in east Belfast,  because the issue was flagged in BMAP and in all the planning procedures. The  Department and the Planning Service have protected the route consistently and  made clear that it was being protected for some form of rapid transit system.  People, therefore, cannot say that they are shocked or surprised to hear the  news, as they have in some of the letters that I have seen.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I remind Members that the route was the old railway line.  Older Members &mdash; they would have to be quite old to remember this &mdash; will  remember that a railway line ran along the proposed route. I do not accept that  people are shocked at the proposal.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cobain</strong>:  Robin Newton will remember the railway line.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Wells: I do not think that Mr Newton remembers the  trains on the Comber railway line &mdash; he is not that old.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">To refer to the walkway as a disused railway track was  perhaps wrong, and I am sure that the Department will accept that. It suggested  that the enjoyment that many people get from the facility was not recognised.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairman said that it is essential that there be total  separation between the walkway and the rapid transit system. My slogan in that  regard would be: &ldquo;What do we want? Segregation now.&rdquo; It is imperative that the  system have a dedicated lane for the rapid transit system, one which it will  not be possible for people to use as a quick route into Belfast or, worse, for parking. That will  throw up some technical difficulties that will have to be overcome.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Weir: Has the Member thought about installing some  sort of Berlin-style wall along the route to prevent any other traffic from  entering?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Wells: Whatever form of segregation is chosen will  have to blend into the environment and look the part. We saw it done  effectively in Holland.  If Members want to see exactly how to do it well, they should visit the Netherlands. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The proposed rapid transit system offers the Minister the  opportunity to show how green he is, in the proper sense, and to introduce  vehicles that are environmentally friendly &mdash; electrically driven or using  liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) &mdash; so that we can reduce the emissions and the  impact of the rapid transit on those who use the walkway. As does the  Committee, I support the proposal in principle.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr McCartney: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann  Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an Aire as a r&aacute;iteas  agus le Cathaoirleach agus le Leas-Chathaoirleach an Choiste. I thank the  Minister for tabling the motion for the take-note debate. It is an important issue,  and I also thank the Committee Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson for  reflecting the Committee&rsquo;s views.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">At its core, rapid transit is about a modern and efficient  public-transport system. It has to move people around a city quickly and bring  communities closer to their places of work, education, health and commerce, with  all the obvious social, economic and environmental spin-offs.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Rapid transit must be seen as an alternative to the car. It  must get people out of cars, and that can be achieved by offering a better mode  of transport or by denying road space to cars by means of dedicated lanes. The  rapid transit system will reduce pollution and our carbon footprint. To achieve  that, we will have to use the best technology available. That technology will not  only relate to hybrid engines but will be required to ensure the availability  of real-time information, seamless ticketing systems and, where required,  guidance systems.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Those objectives are achievable, and, as the Minister,  Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson said, we saw successful schemes that covered  a range of distances in cities of various population bases in Holland.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">What was also very evident in Holland was that those in positions of  responsibility had the ability and the desire to make the required decisions.  Arguments will be made that Belfast&rsquo;s  streetscape is too restrictive, that people are too used to their cars, that  congestion will never be tackled and that there is no additional space for  dedicated lanes. All those arguments were made in Holland, but decision-makers had the vision,  foresight and determination to bring about change. Therefore, I welcome the  Minister&rsquo;s intention to take the big decision on this matter.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Others who are already convinced of the need for a rapid  transit system will use the example of the Luas in Dublin  to argue that Belfast  should have a light rail system. I believe that, given the capital investment required  and the Atkins report about passenger numbers, the bus option is better. Given  that the system will only attract 600 extra passengers, the figures provided by  the Minister &mdash; &pound;590 million for light rail and &pound;147 million for a bus-based  system &mdash; tell their own story. Although fiscal matters should never be the sole  determinant in any process, in this instance the extra cost is not justifiable.  That makes the case for a bus-based system all the more compelling.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee was reassured that the Department for  Regional Development wants to ensure that the construction of the system will  be such that if a transfer to light rail is required in the future, it will not  cause unnecessary construction costs and disruption.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The routes into east and west Belfast and the Titanic Quarter will be  developed in the first phase of the development. The Minister said that there would  be pilot schemes, but I have no doubt that this system will realise its social,  economic and environmental objectives and that there will be a demand for new  routes, taking the system into north and south Belfast.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Although I commend the Minister for this initiative and  accept that Belfast is the key economic hub of  the North, it is worth noting that Utrecht  has a population base of 100,000 and has 105,000 jobs contained within its city  limits. Utrecht  has an efficient rapid-transport system, which was seen as one of the key  drivers in securing and maintaining that level of economic performance.  Therefore, the people of Derry will be watching the system unfold in Belfast and we will be at the Minister&rsquo;s door to campaign  for a rapid transit system in Derry, so that we can repeat the success of Belfast and Utrecht.  Sin a bhfuil.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName">Dr McDonnell: I feel more sadness than excitement about  the enthusiasm that I hear about the introduction of bigger and bendier buses,  because that is what this amounts to. Some years ago, I raised the issue of  light rail in the House of Commons, as I believe that light rail is the best  system. I believe that, by juggling the figures for the cost options, the  comparisons that have been presented are not as honest or as accurate as they  should be.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I am glad that when I raised the issue in the House of  Commons, I, along with others, managed to persuade David Cairns to extend the  scope of the feasibility study that was beginning at that time. To a large  extent, this discussion is a result of that study. I thank the Minister for  tabling this issue, but I honestly believe that we are deluding ourselves if we  are fooled into thinking that somehow or other people will all queue up to get on  bigger buses.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The need for a rapid transit system was recognised in the  investment strategy, as was the role that that system would play in attracting  investment. If we do not include the investment potential of a light rail  system, we are not comparing like with like.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Effective regeneration and infrastructure development is a  highly complex issue, and many of the most disadvantaged parts of the urban  environment in the Belfast  metropolitan area face a range of complex social, environmental, educational and  economic challenges. Dealing with those requires joined-up thinking across the  Departments for Social Development, Employment and Learning, and Regional  Development. The importance of a comprehensive, integrated approach to  regeneration and infrastructure development cannot be overstressed.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The development of a rapid transit system must not be  addressed as a single-issue project. Instead, we must ensure that it has a  wide-ranging impact on the economic growth, regeneration and future prosperity  of the city.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The need for a rapid transit system is well documented and  was addressed in chapter 5 of the report. The report assessed four technology  options and various routes. However, the conclusion that a light rail system  would not be economical is wrong, and I will not be persuaded otherwise.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Belfast is reinventing itself, so there is no point in  introducing a transport system in 10 years that was assessed on the city&rsquo;s  position three, four or five years ago. The Victoria Square complex has increased the  retail capacity of Belfast  city centre by 30%. Belfast  has become one of the top 10 retail centres in these islands.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The regeneration of the Cathedral Quarter, the Titanic  Quarter and other ambitious projects will contribute to bringing more people  into our city. The downside of that renaissance is increased congestion on our  roads and a lack of reasonable car parking. Much of the congestion is a direct  result of our dependence on a failed bus-based public-transport system. Does  anyone in the House believe that more buses or bigger buses will relieve our  congested streets and persuade people to switch from their cars to a bus-based  public-transport system?</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Historically, Belfast  was at the cutting edge of technology. The construction of the Titanic and  other large ships 100 years ago, the construction of City Hall and the creation  of the earliest electric street-lighting system provide ample evidence that Belfast did not always  pursue the cheapest option.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Deputy Speaker: I ask the Member to draw his remarks  to a close.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName">Dr McDonnell: I urge the Minister to reassess the  report and not accept it at face value. It is a very disappointing outcome, and  I have to &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Deputy Speaker: Order. That was not a signal for you  to get your second wind, Dr McDonnell.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName">Dr McDonnell: I was not getting my second wind.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Deputy Speaker: Order. The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mrs Long: I thank the Minister for tabling this matter  for a take-note debate. I have already written to the Minister on the subject,  so I apologise if my remarks are repetitious. In my defence, many issues that  are discussed in the House are repetitious.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I support the introduction of a modern and efficient rapid  transit system for Belfast.  It is good that we are moving away from facilitating the private car, which has  been the emphasis to date and has been detrimental to the social and economic  development of the city and the health and well-being of its citizens.  Therefore, this is a good move forward. I will not spend my time throwing  bouquets when I agree with the report, but I will highlight the issues that I  am concerned about. Rapid transit is important, it must be advanced, and I hope  that it is successful.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I share the disappointment of other Members, which the  Minister referred to, that light rail was not the chosen option. I understand  that there must be a balance between expenditure and development, but the aim  is not just to capture customers for public transport, but to capture the  public imagination. I have concerns about whether a bus-based system would be  able to capture the public imagination to the same degree as a light rail  system. To achieve a modal shift, particularly in a country where car usage is  culturally ingrained, we require an imaginative proposal. That is something  that I want to explore, particularly in the context of the Minister&rsquo;s opening  remarks that migration to a light rail system is a possibility in the future.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Given the balance in the Department&rsquo;s budget, which is 80%  in favour of road and 20% in favour of public transport at the end of the  three-year Budget cycle, a skew in funding towards public transport and away  from road building would help to achieve a higher-quality solution to the  problem that we are discussing.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">If we are to take big measures for the city, perhaps we  have to spend slightly more money rather than implementing a more  cost-effective but less imaginative solution.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">An overall package should be implemented so that if the  pilot scheme works and is effective, it will be clear how it can be rolled out  throughout the rest of the city and to the connections in between. Putting it  in that context is likely to make it much more successful. It will be difficult  to judge whether it has been a success until the entire network is in place.  That is the danger with pilot schemes, although, I do understand why that  option has been pursued.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I also want to address the issue from a constituency  perspective, with particular reference to the E-way. I accept that the rapid  transit system is not a surprise. At one point, there was a proposal for a  four-lane motorway along the Comber greenway. I was told that by someone who  has lived in the area for approximately 43 years. I am glad that that is no  longer being proposed. However, I am not entirely enthused about the current  proposals.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister is right that the E-way was well developed as  an off-route cycling and walking route by the Department for Regional  Development. No one anticipated how popular it would be, and it has outstripped  what people expected. For that reason, people feel its loss more acutely than  would have been the case a number of years ago.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">What to do with the designated sites of local nature  conversation importance and biodiversity along the E-way must be considered.  The area around the Bloomfield  walkway section of the greenway consists of terraced houses that have no  gardens, so it is the only open recreation space available. For a long time, it  has been used for that purpose.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I also want to draw to the Minister&rsquo;s attention the fact  that most people who have written to him with concerns about the system are  avid users of public transport. They include cyclists, but they are also people  who use buses and trains and are supportive of the concept. Therefore, that  group of people can be worked with.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I simply want to know whether more could be done to dispel  concerns that the new system will attack the Metro system that runs through the  heart of east Belfast  communities and along the main arterial routes. Furthermore, will the new  system act to relieve congestion temporarily by transporting commuters from  outside the city limits? That could result in people inside the city limits &mdash;  who have already made the shift to public transport &mdash; being attracted back to  using their cars. There is only a short period in which to address such issues.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps restricting the width of the new system should also  be considered. There are options for tidal bus lanes that would reasonably  accommodate cyclists, those who wish to walk and some form of rapid transit  system. However, it concerns me that that would not be of the same quality.  Keeping the channels of discussions open with those who have expressed their  concerns will be most helpful.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>:  As other Members have done, I welcome the opportunity to debate this issue, and  I thank the Minister for tabling the motion. A rapid transit system will  benefit the economic development of Belfast  as a whole, and the initiative signifies a move to progress the transport  system in a way that the traditional bus system is unable to do.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Many people, including Mrs Long and I, will be disappointed  with the decision to opt for a bus system rather than a light rail system. The  latter is perceived to be relevant to the longer-term potential of an efficient  rapid transit system and to the continued physical and economic development of  the city.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise that the capital cost estimates between  rapid-bus transport and light rail systems that were set out in the report is  an important element of the consultant&rsquo;s recommendations of a bus-based system.  However, the basis of the cost comparisons &mdash; at least in my humble opinion &mdash;  are unclear about whether the comparison is like for like and whether the  system, as suggested, can be upgraded at a later stage to incorporate trams or  light rail.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The overall success of the scheme, as has been referred to,  should not be determined only by the ability to move passengers from point A to  point B. Rather, the system should be a major priority in contributing to the  development of Belfast&rsquo;s  economy.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">For that reason, as far as East Belfast is concerned, the  rapid transit system should, ultimately, provide people with the potential to  travel from places as far away as Comber, through Newtownards, Dundonald and  Holywood Arches to the Titanic Quarter &mdash; that encompasses the travel-to-work  area anticipated for the Titanic Quarter.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister must also consider how the system will service  the George Best Belfast   City Airport.  The airport is continuing to thrive; its passenger numbers are increasing, and  it is further developing its services to Great   Britain and Europe. That  is a key point.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In his speech, Mr Cobain referred to the need for  communication with communities. I have no doubt that the Minister will  understand the concerns of bus users who faced a huge change when the Metro  system was introduced. It resulted in radio phone-in programmes being deluged  with complaints; letters to the press, and local community groups holding  public meetings about the problems as that system was being introduced.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">If the rapid transit system is to be successful, it must be  characterised by a high level of specification, and I welcome the fact that the  Minister mentioned the stops, interchanges, ticketing and real-time information  that would be provided. To be successful, the system must be benchmarked  favourably against any other system in any other part of the world.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Another feature that will make or break the system is how  it will travel adjacent to other vehicles on the open road. In the absence of a  dedicated route segregation and priority over other traffic, users need to be  assured of the scheduled frequency and speed of the service.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As regards my constituency of East   Belfast, the Minister will be aware of the environmental lobby  that was mentioned. I am a regular user of the Comber Greenway, particularly  around the Bloomfield  area, and I enjoy that facility. Some people have strong feelings about  protecting that area for the exclusive use of walkers and cyclists. I do not  agree completely with those views, but, as Jim Wells mentioned, some sympathy  for those points of view should be included in the proposals.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I will finish by saying that there are essential points that  need to be considered. One of those is communication with the public, which I  mentioned. The benefits to the economy need to be defined as that investment is  rolled out. The system needs to be built to a high level of specification. The  investment and involvement of the private sector should be considered.  Potential routes within the city and traffic priority levels need to be defined  &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should draw his remarks to a close.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Newton: A value-for-money concept should run  throughout the proposals.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr P Maskey: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann  Comhairle. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement regarding the rapid transit  system for Belfast.  Like many of my party colleagues, I am very happy that the system will also  service West Belfast. For many years,  transport infrastructure &mdash; or indeed any other infrastructure that came from  Departments &mdash; for West Belfast has not been  good enough.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The proposals should be about connecting West   Belfast with other parts of the city. When the roads through West Belfast were designed, it was as though a moat had  been created around the city, which was very hard to get out of. There was no  connection between the bottom of the Falls Road or Shankill Road and other parts of the  city. Those roads were blocked off, and it was very awkward for people to  travel from one part of the city to another. I welcome this initiative.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Alasdair McDonnell talked about his preference for a light  rail system. All of us would prefer such a system. However, although the bus  system would cost &pound;147 million, a light rail system would cost &pound;590 million.  The issue has been talked about for far too long. I have been a member of  Belfast City Council for a number of years, and this issue has been considered  by its development committee. Departmental representatives have come to the  council and discussed the issue on many occasions, but the council has not done  a single thing about it.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister deserves credit, because &pound;111 million has  already been raised to develop the proposals. Other investment has yet to be  made.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is a credit to the Department and to the Minister that  proposals are being put on the table and that the consultation process is  almost complete. It is important to note that decisions have been made, and, in  just under a year, we will see plans for the rapid transit system come to  fruition. The proposed start date is 2011. The rapid transit system is a good  measure, not only for the people of the city, but for those who are drawn to it  from around the world.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">5.30 pm</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We have heard about various quarters of the city during the  debate. However, the Gaeltacht quarter, which is another emerging area that  will, hopefully, attract many hundreds of thousands of visitors every year, has  not yet been mentioned. We want to enable visitors to go from one part of the  city to another &mdash; be that from the Titanic Quarter to other quarters &mdash; and that  issue must be addressed in future plans.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Royal Victoria Hospital  attracts many people to Belfast,  and that fact has been missed in the past. If the rapid transit system were to  follow the right route, it could cater for people who attend the Royal Victoria   Hospital &mdash; people could  visit patients in the hospital as they please without having to fight the  rush-hour traffic. If I am lucky enough to leave here just before 5.00 pm, it  can take me over an hour &mdash; sometimes an hour and 15 minutes &mdash; to reach home on  a route that passes the Royal   Victoria Hospital.  I know the pressure that hospital traffic adds.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We have many issues to consider. The Minister has already  said that one third of the population of the city lives in west Belfast, and that is a  key fact. West Belfast is also home to the  emerging Glenmona site, which is the same size as the Titanic Quarter &mdash; and we  do not know what will emerge on that site. It is hoped that the master plan  will provide an idea of the number of people who will live and work in that  area. However, we must also ensure that people from all parts of the city &mdash;  including the west &mdash; will have the opportunity to work in the Titanic Quarter,  which is vital for the future development of the city.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I commend the Minister on proposing the motion, and I hope  that the rapid transit system will progress. As the Minister said in his  opening remarks, we can always look at the opportunities for a light rail  system in the future, and we should not lose sight of that. The Department has  worked hard and has consulted several agencies, including various partnership  boards and enterprise councils that also support the system. Go raibh maith  agat.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  I welcome the debate. There is an overwhelming case for a rapid-transport system  for the Belfast  area. We have seen a tremendous growth in car ownership and car usage over the  years, along with an increase in traffic and housing developments &mdash;  particularly in the north of the city &mdash; and people from those public and  private housing estates go to work in the city centre. Many new developments  are being built in Belfast,  which is our regional capital city and a regional economic driver. Traffic in Belfast has increased  greatly and, therefore, there is a need for a rapid transit system.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It has already been said that the system must be integrated  and linked to other aspects of transport. The system must be easy to use and  provide an efficient service, and must be environmentally friendly. I have  noted from discussions the merits and demerits of a rapid bus system and an  electric light-rail system.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There is merit in further exploration and explanation of  the decision that has been made. This matter must be looked at with a view to  the long term, and it must be acknowledged that the capital cost is much  greater for a rail system. However, we must look carefully to see whether that,  in the longer term, is the most advantageous system.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I want to address the location of the pilot schemes, which  has not yet been mentioned. Initially they were to be located in south and east  Belfast; however, the Minister subsequently  heeded the calls of his party colleagues in west Belfast,  including Paul Maskey, who today outlined the great demand for the system that  will come from the Gaeltacht quarter and other developments in west Belfast.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">An overwhelming case exists for the provision of a pilot  scheme along the north foreshore. The extent of the development in the north of  the city and along the Shore Road  provides many reasons for a pilot scheme on that route. The north foreshore  development is due to start soon, and one has only to look at the number of  students who live in Belfast but travel to study at the University of Ulster  campus in Jordanstown or the Northern Regional College campus in Newtownabbey.  All that development along the north foreshore &mdash; housing, the college campus,  the university campus, schools, and so forth &mdash; creates a strong case for a  pilot scheme along the north foreshore, York Road, Shore Road and beyond.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Given that there will be pilot schemes in south, east and  west Belfast, will the Minister explain how the  decision deliberately to exclude north Belfast  was made? Will he reconsider the inclusion of a route along the Shore Road? There  are many housing estates there and, by and large, people who live in them have  family, business and work connections in Belfast.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  thank the Minister for Regional Development for his statement, and I welcome  the vision shown in the strategic outline case that he sketched for the  Assembly. However, as with all such projects, the devil is in the detail; the  design and the delivery of the project will be crucial to its success.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Belfast is the main  population centre and economic hub of Northern Ireland. It is vital,  therefore, that it is developed as a modern city with a transport network that  can facilitate the economic and social development of Belfast and the region. A prosperous and  growing Belfast will help to create a prosperous  and growing Northern Ireland.  London and Dublin  are prime examples of how successful cities are key drivers in their national  economies. Modern business is drawn to locations that can offer a high standard  of living and provide excellent transport, social and cultural facilities.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">A huge potential for regeneration exists in areas that will  be serviced by a rapid transit system. There is also a great opportunity to  link areas of the city that have, historically, been isolated from each other.  The environmental benefits of such a system must not be underestimated.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionist Party would have preferred the  development of a light rail rapid transit system to reflect its ambitions for Northern Ireland and Belfast. However, we accept the argument, as  outlined in the strategic business case, that such a scheme is not, at this stage  economically viable. Where would the additional hundreds of millions of pounds  come from? In today&rsquo;s fiscally constrained climate, not to choose the more  economically viable option would have been irresponsible. It would have placed  an additional burden on taxpayers and, perhaps, even defeated the purpose of a  rapid transit system by imposing unacceptably high costs on its users.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The UUP welcomes that the strategic outline advised that  the bus-based system be upgradeable to a light rail system in the future, when  the figures justify it. The UUP strongly advocates that the scheme be designed  and built with such an upgrade in mind.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There is no point in cutting corners when designing the  proposed rapid transit system. The routes for the bus-based system must be  segregated from mainstream traffic to facilitate speed and ease of use for the  passengers, and that will be the difference between the existing system and the  new rapid transit system. There must not be a halfway house, where buses and  cars compete for space on the roads.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">If the rapid transit system is to work, it must be made a  priority. A major element of the scheme is to incentivise people to get out of  their cars, with the result that traffic will be reduced, liveability in the  city will be increased, and the environment will benefit. To do that, the  system must be truly rapid. Equally, the Minister must give assurances that the  system will be integrated fully with the existing &mdash; and any planned &mdash; Metro  system, Ulsterbus network, and Northern Ireland Railways services. There must  be adequate park-and-ride facilities at the tentacles of those networks so that  the rural community can also benefit from transportation that goes right into  the heart of the city centre.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We must ensure that such a system will be financially and  functionally attractive to potential passengers. The Minister must also ensure  that the rapid transit system will become integrated fully into larger  development plans. He must consider &mdash; and aim to integrate the scheme with &mdash;  committed and new developments in each of the areas that will be facilitated.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that the Minister will work hard to ensure that the  maximum developer contribution can be leveraged through planning permission. As  the strategic outline case suggests, developer contributions towards the cost  of the city centre Titanic Quarter route should be a condition of granting  planning permission for the remaining phases of the development of that area.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The scheme presents great opportunities for the people of  the region generally and for east and west Belfast in particular. However, I hope that  the Minister will work with the Minister for Social Development, and with local  communities, to ensure that such regeneration does not marginalise any  community or cause unwelcome side effects. The Minister must take on board  community environmental concerns when he is developing his detailed proposals.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Like most Members, I welcome the  fact that there is now a Minister and Department prepared to make the  significant decision to introduce a rapid transit system. There is no doubt  that Belfast  needs such a system, given the chronic traffic congestion in the city. The  scheme is to be welcomed, albeit that it will be introduced as a pilot scheme  at the outset. I share the concern, and perhaps a little of the disappointment,  that the area that I represent in south Belfast  will not be included in the pilot transit scheme. Nevertheless, I can only  welcome the fact that a scheme will be introduced in the city. Even on a pilot  basis, that scheme must inevitably go some way towards reducing traffic  congestion in the city.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">If the project is to work and to take people from their  vehicles and on to public transport, I presume that from the outset, traffic  would be eased to some extent. I hope that that is the case, and I have no  doubt that the Minister and the Department will hope the same.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I was concerned when Alasdair McDonnell appeared to dismiss  the concept out of hand, saying that he was sad and disappointed. He went on to  say that he raised the matter in Westminster  some time ago; clearly, what he said fell on deaf ears, as he did not get too  far with it. I am pleased that we now have a Minister who is prepared to take  this important step and who will at least make a start on the project.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It was unfortunate to hear Dr McDonnell describe as  dishonest the figures that the Minister mentioned. I do not think that that can  go unchallenged. I do not know, and cannot second guess, the figures that the  consultants and the Minister produced. However, there is a fair gap between the  figures of around &pound;147 million and &pound;600 million that have been quoted, and I do  not think that such sums could be played around with.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Clearly, we cannot ignore the cost. All Members and all  parties here are fully aware that we have a finite budget and that we cannot  pay for all the things that we want and that many of us included in our  manifestos. Nelson McCausland referred to Paul Maskey&rsquo;s mention of the  Gaeltacht quarter in west Belfast.  I suggest that the case for the north of the city may be helped if there were a  Gaeltacht quarter in north Belfast,  and I suggest that the Minister consider that in the time ahead.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It would be beneficial on a whole range of levels. The  Minister referred to other parts of the city, such as north Belfast  and south Belfast,  in his statement. Raymond McCartney mentioned places that are outside of Belfast. Obviously, all  Members have a keen interest in the project&rsquo;s success.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">5.45 pm</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">During the time ahead, when we discuss whether it will be a  &ldquo;big bendy bus&rdquo;, as Alasdair McDonnell described earlier, I hope that we will  see what the delivery actually looks like. Some time ago, we were given images  of the vehicles. It would be helpful if the public could see the type of  infrastructure that is being discussed. That will help to inform everyone  during the time ahead when we must make up our minds about the wisdom of the  project.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister for the assurance in his speech that  certain other areas will not be ignored in the meantime. In south Belfast, where there is  some of the most serious traffic congestion in the city, the Minister has met  residents&rsquo; organisations during the recent consultation on residents-only  parking schemes. The City   Hospital and Queen&rsquo;s  University draw in tens of thousands of people from all over the place. That  contributes to serious traffic congestion in the area. Will the Minister  elaborate on measures that will be introduced while pilot schemes are ongoing  in other parts of the city, and give some indication of how long the schemes,  during which those matters will be assessed, will operate, so that the wider  public will have a sense of how long it may have to wait to see whether those  pilot projects are successful and how long it will be until the extension of  such projects throughout the city can be looked upon favourably? Go raibh maith  agat.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I support the report&rsquo;s direction. At the risk of sounding like a bit of a  trainspotter, I have had a long interest in the subject. As anyone who has read  the report will be aware, one thing that we will not spot along the line is a  train. My only slight disappoint&shy;ment, which other Members have,  understandably, mentioned in the debate, is that the light-rail option is not  the preferred option.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The people of Comber, in my constituency, will have to wait  a while longer to become, once again, the Crewe of Northern Ireland. Back in  the day, Comber was at the centre of a commuter rail network, before Northern Ireland  even had commuters. People have mocked my good friend Robin Newton because he  remembers the railway line. Of course, he is far too young to remember it.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  He must have had a hard life.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Hamilton: He had a hard paper round.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague in Ards Borough Council Billy Montgomery  recalls the last day of the Comber railway line, which, he tells me, was marked  by a celebratory fireworks display. In retrospect, the event should have been a  wake, and not marked in such a salubrious fashion.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I understand entirely that the lack of a sufficient  population density in Belfast  militates against a light-rail option. Having watched the film &lsquo;Field of  Dreams&rsquo; on television the other evening, I am tempted to say that if we build  it they will come. I hope that, some day down the line, the possibly will exist  for at least one of the lines to be upgraded to light rail status. It is  important that whatever is constructed is compatible with conversion to light  rail at a later date so that the costs of that can be mitigated.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I want to touch on two broad, substantive areas. One is the  important matter of integration with other forms of transport. The Minister  will forgive me for being parochial in that respect. The Comber Greenway has  already been mentioned. It is a popular walking and cycling route. In fact, it  has surpassed everyone&rsquo;s expectations as to how popular it has become.  Understandably, some people are concerned about the loss of that amenity. It is  important that they are assured that it will not be lost and that, in fact, it  will be retained in some way or another.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is also important to remember that the E-way in east Belfast will run along a  disused railway line that has, indeed, been set aside for many years for a  rapid transit system such as that which has been proposed. I would argue for  the extension of the E-way further into the Strangford constituency, into towns  such as Comber and Newtownards, which are basically commuter towns from where  we would hope to attract people out of their cars and onto the rapid transit  scheme.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In a town such as Newtownards, there is the ludicrous  possibility that one of the hardest parts of the daily commute is getting  through the town itself. It is important that part of the service is extended  to those towns to allow the optimum number of people to avail of the service.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In the interim period, a park-and-ride facility will be in  place. The location of that park-and-ride facility in the east of the city is  also important. If, as the report suggests, there is to be solely one  park-and-ride facility, either in the Newtownards corridor or in the Comber  corridor, some people may be tempted to drive out of their way to get to the  facility to park their car. That may not have the desired effect.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In a previous reply to a question for oral answer (AQO  2710/08) from me, the Minister said that all procurement options were on the  table, including PPP, PFI and private-sector input. That is welcome and  important because such options can mitigate the substantial costs, which other  Members have mentioned and which are included in the report, and any  contribution that the private sector can make would be useful. In addition, the  input of private-sector operators who have expertise in that sort of operation  elsewhere in the UK, in Ireland or elsewhere in Europe,  would be invaluable. There is a risk that we are so bus-focused and  bus-orientated in Northern    Ireland that a project that is completely  different from that may not be as successful as it would be if it were run by a  company that had the requisite expertise. The private sector can make a  contribution to infrastructure &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption].</span></p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I hear &ldquo;Red&rdquo; Fred Cobain barking from the back.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The private sector can make an important contribution to  infrastructure such as stations. In Dublin,  residential and retail developments that have been built by the private sector  are adjacent to stations, and that allows substantial costs to be taken away.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The most important thing is that the rapid transport scheme  is completed quickly. Some of us have been waiting for a long time, and it is  important &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to draw his remarks to a close before I have to  strike him out.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName">Ms J McCann: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann  Comhairle. I welcome the opportunity to take part in the debate on the delivery  of the rapid transit system, which will complement, improve and integrate  public transport for the needs and the future needs of all the community in Belfast. It is hoped that  such a system will be a pilot system, which, if successful, can be applied to  north and south Belfast  to deliver a long-term integrated and sustainable transport system that links  all communities to employment, education facilities and hospitals.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As my colleague Paul Maskey said, it is no secret that  areas such as west Belfast,  including Shankill, have suffered a severe lack of investment in jobs and  economic regeneration over the years. As was pointed out earlier, a third of  the population of Belfast lives in west Belfast, yet it has some of the most  deprived and disadvantaged wards in the North of Ireland. Many young people  leave school with no academic qualifications and no prospect of employment.  Therefore, the rapid transit system provides an opportunity to promote equality  of opportunity through the linkages to employment and education.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Procurement was mentioned earlier. The investment strategy  and the Programme for Government contain a number of key priorities, of which  growing the economy and using increased prosperity and economic growth to  tackle existing patterns of social disadvantage and ongoing poverty are  central. The procurement of major infrastructure is committed to be taken  forward in such a way to ensure that equality, sustainability and social  outcomes are the core of the project. Therefore, the rapid transit system  offers the opportunity to create economic regeneration in areas of disadvantage  by creating employment opportunities in its development and opening up access  to employment and educational opportunities by providing a much-needed gateway.  The rapid transit system will also help the environment and cut down on traffic  congestion.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The proposed route is mentioned in the pilot scheme.  Although I appreciate that it is currently out for consultation, there would be  a major gap in the service if consideration were not given to the Colin area at  the edge of west Belfast.  The route must include the main Stewartstown    Road. The Colin area is made up of Poleglass,  Twinbrook, Lagmore and Kilwee, and it has a population of 30,000, the  equivalent of a small town. Currently, it is within the Lisburn City Council  area, but that may change under the RPA.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Colin area has high unemployment levels, and two of its  wards rate in the top 10 on the Noble multiple-deprivation indices. One third  of Lisburn City Council&rsquo;s population live in the Colin area, and the fact that  there is just one play park, one comprehensive secondary school and no major  shopping facility or leisure centre demonstrates that it is highly deprived.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Although the Colin area is close to Lisburn, it is in west Belfast. Nevertheless,  the transport system between Colin and Lisburn is totally inadequate. Although  I am conscious that we are discussing the rapid transit system for Belfast, I hope that the Minister will also investigate  the corridor between Belfast  and Lisburn, particularly the route from the Falls Road to the Stewartstown Road  and on to Lisburn.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that people in the Colin area feel, and are,  connected to employment and education opportunities in both Belfast and Lisburn, and, if the rapid  transit system goes as far as the Colin area, people will be connected with  leisure facilities and shops. I hope that the Minister will take that on board.  Go raibh maith agat.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister for Regional Development: Go raibh maith  agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Members who took part in the debate.  The contributions were interesting and, clearly, there is significant interest  in the rapid transit proposals for Belfast  from Members who live in and around the city and members of the Regional  Development Committee. I also thank the Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson of  the Committee for their comments, and I appreciate the Committee&rsquo;s broad  support for the proposals.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As the Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson said, the devil  will be in the detail, and key factors must be developed further. My Department  is happy to talk to the Committee about that, and I am pleased that the  Committee recognises that, to date, there has been significant discourse  between the Department and the Committee. I hope that that will continue.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Key issues of detail must be tackled, and they concern, as  the Chairperson and others identified, the conflict for street space between  cars and the rapid transit system &mdash; not to be too dramatic, the conflict in the  streets. Quite a few Members mentioned transport integration as a potential  obstacle to the system&rsquo;s success, and we must address that key issue.  Furthermore, in order to ensure an efficient, total transport system,  integrated ticketing will be essential to connect the proposed system with Belfast&rsquo;s existing system.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Deputy Chairperson and others pointed out the potential  to introduce a greener form of transport, and we saw evidence of that in Holland. Locally, we have  also seen people&rsquo;s ability to produce much more environmentally friendly  vehicles, and, as we develop the project, those considerations will be high on  our priority list.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Raymond McCartney, Robin Newton and other Members spoke of  the necessity for top-class technology, and that is right. That connects to the  points made by Naomi Long and Alex Maskey about capturing the public&rsquo;s  imagination; this is all part of that package.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Many Members were disappointed about the decision not to  adopt a light rail system. If we act on the recommendations in the consultants&rsquo;  report, we will have to embark on an exercise to capture the public&rsquo;s  imagination. That will involve the complete package, and not just, as Alasdair  McDonnell said, bendy buses. It must be about technology, the facilities for  getting on and off the buses, speed, the segregation from other transport  systems, and the reduced travel time &mdash; the entire package. The purpose of the  project is not, as some people implied, to create an additional bus system, but  to create a new transport system that will attract people from their cars.  Therefore, it must capture the public&rsquo;s imagination.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In response to Alex Maskey&rsquo;s point, in order to capture  some imagination, generate interest and show people what this might look like,  we intend to launch the system by displaying the type of vehicle that we are  considering. If the discussion is confined to this Chamber and we do not manage  to engender interest among the general public &mdash; the travelling public &mdash; in the Belfast area about the  opportunities and potential for the system, this will have been a fairly  worthless exercise.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">6.00 pm</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Several Members mentioned the E-way and the Comber Greenway  route, and the Department has been lobbied extensively on the issue. Although  most Members who spoke today have recognised that the Comber Greenway was  always earmarked as a route for a rapid transit system, nonetheless, it has  proved to be a very popular cycle path and walkway. The Department appreciates  that and is trying to develop proposals to allow the route to be used as a  walkway and as a part of a rapid transit system. I am confident that proposals  can be developed that will not push cyclists and walkers off the route.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Next week, departmental officials will meet residents along  the route and show them some of the options being developed. I intend to  examine the route soon to see how the plans could be accommodated, and I am  very keen to find a satisfactory solution. The Department has put a great deal  of resources and effort into promoting cycling and walking as alternative means  of transport, and I do not want to develop a transport system that will impact  negatively on such activities. Quite a few Members raised that issue, and I  assure them that my officials are listening to what people are saying. I am  confident that we can accommodate their needs.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Robin Newton and Simon Hamilton mentioned the possibility  of extending the E-way route to Newtownards and Comber. It is fairly obvious  that the further the system extends out of the city the more the population  decreases and the more the proposal becomes less economical. The trick is to  have a rapid transit system in a densely populated area in which there is a  large footfall. Thus, it would make less economic sense to extend the scheme  out to Comber. I hope that the pilot scheme is successful, and that people are  attracted to use the system.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Paul Maskey and Jennifer McCann mentioned how the system  could benefit West Belfast. The Department  does see opportunities to connect areas across the city, including west and  east Belfast,  which have been difficult to connect. There will be an opportunity for people  in economically deprived areas to have access to a transport system that would  allow them better access to jobs and educational institutions, and so on. I  particularly noted Jennifer McCann&rsquo;s point about the Colin area of West Belfast, and she made a very good case for improving  the transport there. Although the scheme being introduced is a pilot scheme, I  hope that it will prove successful and can be rolled out to other areas across Belfast. Other Members  also expressed disappointment that the scheme was not being introduced in their  areas.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Alasdair McDonnell &mdash; who has now left the Chamber &mdash; and  others mentioned their disappointment that the consultants had not opted for a  light rail system. I am disappointed that he suggested that there had been some  dishonesty in the figures used to justify the case for a bus-based system. I  appreciate that people who have been impressed by the Luas in Dublin are disappointed that a similar scheme  will not be implemented here. Nonetheless, the figures stacked up in a  particular way, and though I accept that people are disappointed, I must point  out that the proposed system allows for an upgrade to light rail in future if  the numbers justify such a move.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Nelson McCausland mentioned North   Belfast. Contrary to his suggestion, the BMTP has always included  a proposal for a West Belfast route. When I  became Minister, I asked that the study take in the entire city because I  thought that it was quite restrictive to have just two routes in one part of  the city. He also mentioned the north foreshore, which is already served by a  motorway and a railway. As I said to Members for South   Belfast, this is a pilot scheme, and I anticipate that it will be  extended into other areas if it is successful. Developments in areas such as  Girdwood Barracks would certainly create the necessary footfall to attract such  a transport scheme. That type of destination would attract consultants to  consider the introduction of a transport scheme, just at they have been  attracted to consider transport needs in other parts of Belfast,  such as the Royal   Victoria Hospital  and Titanic Quarter, and so on.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Several Members mentioned developer contributions, and I  want to clear up an issue that Simon Hamilton raised. The consultants recommended  a PPP/PFI procurement process for the construction of a light rail system.  However, they recommended that the Department develop the infrastructure for a  bus-based system and then look to a third party to lease it to.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Department considered developer contributions, which  Roy Beggs mentioned. We have written to the Minister for Social Development in  order to maximise regeneration opportunities along the suggested routes.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Alex Maskey was one of those who asked what is happening on  other routes. As I said in my opening remarks, because this is a pilot scheme  the Department is looking at particular areas of the city. However, other parts  of the city should not feel neglected, as there will be work on quality bus  corridors and the extension of park-and-ride facilities. It is not a case,  therefore, of all our eggs being put in one transport basket. These are pilot  schemes that will be developed and which are expected to be a success and  extended to other areas in the city. In the meantime, we also intend to improve  the transport network in other parts of the city to ensure that public  transport is improved across Belfast.</p>

        <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="9"></a>Proposed Chicken Waste Plant at Glenavy</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The proposer of the topic for debate will have 15 minutes in which  to speak, and all other Members who wish to speak will have approximately five  minutes.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the opportunity to  debate this issue in the Assembly. There has been quite a bit of concern in  Glenavy and Lagan Valley and in the adjoining constituency of South Antrim about this proposed chicken waste  incinerator plant, which will be located close to an existing Glenfarm Holdings  incinerator plant that deals with offal.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The plant is proposed by a consortium of Rose Energy, Moy Park  and O&rsquo;Kane&rsquo;s Poultry, and Glenfarm Holdings to try to deal with chicken waste  litter, which, under the EC Nitrates Directive, cannot be spread on land.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I was looking at a question that was asked of the present  Environment Minister&rsquo;s uncle-in-law, Sam Foster, in 2000, by Ivan Davis, a  former MLA for Lagan   Valley, about Glenfarm  Holdings when the existing incinerator plant received approval. The present  Minister of the Environment wrote to me about, I believe, some 24  investigations of pollution of local rivers; there have also been numerous  complaints about odours emanating from the plant. I spoke today to residents  who were complaining about the plant and who had been visited by officials from  the Environment and Heritage Service.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Despite measures that have been taken and approvals  received under planning regulations, there has been widespread concern  throughout Glenavy and as far away as Crumlin about how the plant has been  operating.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There will be concerns that the new plant intends to bring  some quarter of a million tons of chicken waste into the area to incinerate &mdash; I  know that the modern-day term is &ldquo;energy from waste&rdquo;, but it is incineration  nevertheless. I share those concerns about health and the environment and about  the damage that this project, which will be on the banks of Lough Neagh, will  do to local tourism.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is an area of outstanding natural beauty and is one of  the most scenic areas in Ireland.  Therefore, it would blight the landscape if an incineration plant were to be  built there. I met representatives from Rose Energy, who told me that the plant  would take two years to construct, which gives Members some idea of its  potential size. Rose Energy never ruled out using water from Lough Neagh and  discharging effluent into it, and no one mentioned that issue in today&rsquo;s  debate. Therefore, there are concerns about the location of the plant. Some  people will say that the plant will generate electricity and contribute to  renewable energy in the area, but residual ash will have to be removed from the  site.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There are also concerns about the impact that the plant  will have on the road network. For some years, the volume of traffic on those  roads has been a major issue. I sit on Lisburn City Council, and I know that  numerous meetings have been held to discuss the traffic problem. The issue of  the chicken-waste plant has also been discussed numerous times at Lisburn City  Council&rsquo;s environmental services committee. Council officials visited the  existing plant before the Environment and Heritage Service assumed responsibility  for such matters. Therefore, the impact that the new plant would have on the  local road network would result in a 10-fold increase in traffic.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There are concerns among residents in the Crumlin area that  the plant will be granted planning permission. Therefore, the Minister of the  Environment is here this evening to give her view on residents&rsquo; concerns about  the erection of such a large plant in the area of Lough Neagh. Indeed, most  MLAs in the area share those concerns. Some parties have different stances on  the issue of incineration. We have to deal with the nitrates directive, but  Glenavy is not the location for such a plant.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There are alternatives to the type of plant that Rose Energy  is proposing. Representatives from Rose Energy held public meetings in Glenavy,  and it seemed that they had come up with their proposal at the last minute  because of concerns about the nitrates directive. They had not even considered  alternative proposals to deal with chicken waste. We have debated some of those  alternative proposals over the past year. For example, anaerobic digestion in  particular could be an alternative to an incineration plant. The Assembly and  the Minister must consider alternatives to deal with the problem of chicken  waste.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I share the residents&rsquo; concerns, and I know that people  will say that there are 7,000 jobs in the poultry industry. Not all of those  jobs are based in the North of Ireland, but Moy Park Foodservice and O&rsquo;Kane  Poultry, and the farmers who are associated with them, are concerned about the  matter. Nevertheless, we must consider alternatives to Rose Energy&rsquo;s proposals  for the site.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that the Minister will take my concerns on board,  and I am sure that other Members will voice similar concerns. However, the  issue is really whether we should site an incineration plant on the shores of  Lough Neagh, blighting the landscape and causing pollution to the local area.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  After listening to the Member for Lagan   Valley&rsquo;s speech, I am  amazed that we are discussing an application that is not yet in the system. He  placed great responsibility on the Minister of the Environment. However, his  entire presentation overlooked the failure by the Minister of Agriculture and  Rural Development and her Department to suggest an alternative to get rid of  that by-product in Northern    Ireland. The Member&rsquo;s assertion that there  is 250,000 tonnes of the by-product in Northern Ireland is correct.  However, by December 2008, a system must be in place. It is not a new  phenomenon; the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development has known of the  impending problem for some time, and her Department has failed to act.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Although there will always be concerns about the location  of such proposals, we must recognise the need for the plant. The Member  suggested alternatives; however, the Department has considered, and rejected, those  measures. No Member could suggest an alternative that has not already been  considered. Moy Park  and O&rsquo;Kane Poultry &mdash; through Rose Energy &mdash; have outlined a viable option that  has worked on the mainland and in other parts of Europe,  and the Member&rsquo;s outright dismissal of that proposal is poor form.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There is a pressing need for the plant, and, as the Member  said, thousands of jobs are at risk. The farming community lobbies us daily on  the matter. Although I understand the concerns about the plant&rsquo;s proposed  location &mdash; the Nimby factor &mdash; we must recognise that the industry in Northern Ireland  needs some sort of chicken-waste plant. Similar plants have worked, and  continue to work, in Great    Britain. The Minister can speak for herself,  but she needs time to consider the application when it is submitted. We are  projecting fear and negativity, and, therefore, I urge Members to be cautious  when discussing the application and to remember that thousands of people are  depending on a system to protect their jobs.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Armstrong: The debate highlights an important issue  facing society in the twenty-first century. From what source do people want to  obtain energy? What type of food do they want to eat? How do they want to  dispose of waste products? We need to neutralise all waste to create power.  Everyone wants access to energy and power. We want to boil kettles, watch  televisions, switch on cookers, make food and heat our homes. People are less  likely to venture an opinion on whether coal, oil or gas-fired power stations  is their preferred source of energy. Westminster  and Whitehall  appear to favour nuclear power &mdash; is that an option?</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Most people claim to support renewable energy. However,  suggestions to erect a wind farm &mdash; one of the cleanest and most renewable  energy forms &mdash; are usually met with opposition. Hard choices must be made. As  with food, people want power; they do not, however, want to be involved in its  creation. People do not support lignite mining, nuclear power or even wind  farms.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Glenavy proposal relates to recycling animal waste &mdash;  specifically chicken waste &mdash; to create power and reduce pollution on waterways  and land. Our society creates vast amounts of waste that must be disposed of  somewhere. Although people do not want to live near landfill sites, we have  been, for too long, content to send all waste to landfill. We have now learnt  that we cannot continue to bury all waste in a hole in the ground, and, therefore,  we have an increased amount of waste to recycle.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As with all planning applications, the Minister and her  officials must assess available evidence and decide whether certain types of  waste-disposal facility, including landfill, recycling and waste-to-power units  pose any health risks. I understand that the proposal is for a state-of-the-art  facility of the kind already exists throughout Western   Europe, and, therefore, I consider it perfectly safe. If the  Minister decides that the Glenavy location poses no risks, it should be  included in Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  efforts to recycle and create energy.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I am a farmer so I know how important it is to find ways to  dispose of farm waste and by-products. The site at Glenavy has been in  operation for about 55 years. No one would seek to implement a system that was  dangerous or that posed a high health risk. People have been living near the  proposed plant site for over half a century.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We are now living in the twenty-first century, and we must  utilise modern methods of farming, waste management and energy creation. Rose  Energy&rsquo;s proposal for the Glenavy site does all three. That is better than  digging big holes in the ground and filling them with waste.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Burns: This is a very important issue. The proposed  chicken-waste incinerator plant affects the constituencies of Lagan Valley,  South Antrim and Upper Bann. There is  tremendous concern in the local community about what is involved in the  establishment of the plant and the extent of the buildings associated with it.  Will the incinerator operate at a level that is efficient enough to produce  electricity, or is its main purpose that of the waste disposal of chicken  waste? That is the big question.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There is no doubt that the proposed incinerator plant is  sited in a rural area. Neither is there any doubt that such a plant belongs in  an industrial estate.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">There are several reasons why the Glenavy site is the wrong  location for the incinerator. The banks of Lough Neagh are an important  wildlife sanctuary. We are trying to create a tourist industry, and to develop  areas that tourists can visit, such as Lough Neagh, which is an important  natural resource. Ram&rsquo;s Island, which is  situated in Antrim borough, is a location that the council would like to  promote as a tourist attraction.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr T Clarke: The Member has mentioned Ram&rsquo;s Island. I do not know whether he attended last week&rsquo;s  meeting of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development, at which the  representatives of Rose Energy gave a presentation about the proposed plant.  They showed a picture of Ram&rsquo;s Island, and  gave a synopsis of how the plant would look from there. The plant can hardly be  seen on the mainland from the view on Ram&rsquo;s Island.  Will the Member clarify that he saw that presentation last week?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Burns: The Member should know that the chimneys and  the water-cooling tower will be as high as the Belfast City   Hospital tower.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Burns: No. There is no question that the plant will  be seen clearly from Ram&rsquo;s Island.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr T Clarke: On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker.  The Member is trying to mislead this Chamber. The information that was given at  the presentation was that the height of the proposed building was 43 metres. If  the Member had attended the Committee meeting, he would have known that. He is  trying to make out that the buildings will be 100 metres high, so he is trying  to mislead people in this Chamber.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Deputy Speaker: I warn the Member about what he has  said, and I ask him to refine his language. Mr Burns is entitled to say  whatever he wants in his description.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr T Clarke: Even if he is misleading?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Deputy Speaker: That is your description, and I ask  you to be careful about saying that anyone is misleading the House. I ask you  to withdraw your statement.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr T Clarke: I refuse to withdraw it.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Deputy Speaker: I ask the Member again to withdraw  the remark, on reflection. Otherwise, I must ask him to leave the House.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr T Clarke: I will withdraw the remark, Mr Deputy  Speaker, but I still believe the information to be inaccurate.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Burns: I was at the Agriculture Committee meeting  last week, and I heard that presentation. The Committee had to be suspended  when it became inquorate, because Members left to attend Question Time.  However, I was present.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We are trying to build a tourism industry in a rural  location on the banks of Lough Neagh. One of the greatest benefits of Lough  Neagh is that it provides us with drinking water. The two main pumping stations  of Castor Bay and Dunore Point are within six  miles of the proposed plant, and millions of gallons of water are pumped out of  Lough Neagh there.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Both the Lisburn Area Plan and the draft BMAP designate the  area around Glenavy as an area of high scenic value and special scientific  interest. People who have applied to build houses in the area have been refused  planning permission, as it is an area of scenic beauty.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">For years, the people of Crumlin and Glenavy have heard the  arguments about modern technology, and they have been reassured that there will  be no smell from the plant. However, the people who live close to Ulster Farm  By-Products know that there is a smell from that plant. No-one will be fooled  by the argument that chicken litter can be moved without creating a smell &mdash;  there will be a smell.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Glenavy site, being is in a rural location, is totally  the wrong site for this plant.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member must draw his remarks to a close.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>: I  urge the Minister to ensure that there is no piggybacking in respect to this  plant. It should be put to a public inquiry.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  thank Paul Butler for securing time for this matter, which is of significant  interest to many people, not only those who live in, and around, Glenavy, but  further afield. As Thomas Burns said, the area extends into three  constituencies.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">First, we should sympathise with the farmers who are caught  up in the problems caused by the nitrates directive. The major issue is that  farmers must have some sort of plan in place by the end of this year, and many  are still trying to deal with it at this late stage. It is clear that farmers  in Northern Ireland  have severe problems, as nitrates and phosphates can no longer be spread on the  land. That will create difficulties, no matter what we say in the Chamber this  evening.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We should have sympathy for those who are caught in that  predicament and for those who work in poultry plants and other poultry  businesses, which contribute hugely to our economy. Several thousand jobs  depend on the poultry sector, so we should not take it lightly.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Having said that, we must examine the best option. Part of  the problem with the application from Rose Energy is that two of its three  partners are respected for their role in the Northern Ireland economy. O&rsquo;Kane  Poultry and Moy Park make significant contributions,  provide significant employment and contribute to Northern Ireland plc.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">6.30 pm</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">However, the third partner has a jaded reputation among  local people. Having had the misfortune of cycling past its plant a couple of  summers ago, I sympathise with the people who live closer to it than I do.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Is incineration the most suitable process? I recently had a  visit from someone who is assessing the viability of anaerobic digestion wastes  from farms and similar businesses. One of the key advantages of anaerobic  digestion is that it works on a much smaller and dispersed scale than  incineration. That would create an opportunity to develop several smaller  plants; it would also benefit from transport savings.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Chicken litter is drier than other wastes. However, a  co-operative process that dealt with more than merely chicken litter could mix  in other agricultural wastes, such as those from creameries and other food  producers. That possibility should be explored.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">However, the final decision on the matter may be confirmed  before the full facts about energy from waste have been uncovered. &ldquo;Energy from  waste&rdquo; is a polite term for incineration &mdash; it may not be the best practical or  environmental option.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">If incineration is deemed to be the best option, what is  the best location, or locations, for such a plant? Lough Neagh is not just  protected at a domestic or UK  level; it is a Ramsar site and should enjoy the highest level of environmental  protection. Therefore, the shores of Lough Neagh are not the most suitable  location for a chicken-waste plant. Furthermore, the surrounding roads would  not cope well with a large number of lorries coming into the area every day and  week.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Paul Butler asked whether water from the lough will be used  in the cooling process; that question has not been answered. It has been  claimed that one of the advantages of the Glenavy site is that it is remote  from poultry farms. Unfortunately, it is also remote from the industry and housing  concentration that would make real use of the waste heap that will be produced.  Under the current proposals, material of calorific value will be carted long  distances to a plant that will yield approximately only 25% energy efficiency.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  The Member is not on the Committee for Agricultural and Rural Development.  Therefore, he would not have heard Rose Energy&rsquo;s presentation in which they  gave valid reasons for locating the plant at Glenavy. The first of those  reasons is the existence of Glenfarm.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The second reason was that the Glenavy site would have a  three-mile exclusion zone in the event of an outbreak of avian flu, for  example. If the plant was located in an area of industrial contentration, such  an outbreak would close down other plants, too.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Ford: I am not a member of the Committee for  Agriculture and Rural Development, but I heard a similar point being made at  the Committee for the Environment. I thank the Member for his intervention  anyway.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We must maximise energy value and achieve more than the  proposed 25% energy efficiency. Indeed, given the amount of energy that will be  expended on carting waste, energy efficiency will probably be less than 25%. We  should assess the viability of an industrial site that could yield 70% or 80%  energy efficiency.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Given that EHS is granted the lead role in the management  of domestic waste, the Department of the Environment should consider giving it  a role &mdash; in conjunction with DARD and DETI &mdash; in the better management of  agricultural waste. That would be preferable to leaving it for private  businesses to submit their best proposals. I hope that the Minister will be  able to give us some kind of a lead on that.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Donaldson: I am not speaking in a ministerial  capacity but as a Member for the constituency of Lagan Valley,  in which the proposed biomass plant will be located.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise the need for such a facility in Northern Ireland;  I am not unsympathetic to the requirements of the poultry industry in that  regard. I also echo the comments made by Mr Ford and Mr Trevor Clarke, which  identified the requirements and targets placed upon us by the European Union.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We have a limited time to resolve this issue, and I  question whether this is the right proposal and the right location. I am not  convinced that Rose Energy&rsquo;s proposal is the only option that is available to  enable Northern Ireland  to meet our targets and to comply with the requirements laid down by the  European Union. At the moment, I am in discussion with a Northern Ireland-based  company that uses a more environmentally friendly process, will recycle the  chicken waste, and will create a fertiliser by-product that the agriculture  industry can use. That is therefore a much more efficient and effective process  that will have the same advantages as Rose Energy claims for its process. The  company that I refer to is in discussion with DARD, DETI and DOE about this  matter. I seek to advance that option, because I believe that it is a better  alternative.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise the needs of the poultry industry and poultry  farmers, as well as our targets and obligations, but I am not convinced that  Rose Energy&rsquo;s process is the best technology for achieving those objectives.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I am far from convinced that this is the right location.  For years, I have been aware of the concerns of local residents about the  impact that the existing plant, which is on the Ballyvannon Road, has on the quality of  their daily lives. The road network in that area has been badly damaged by the  heavy vehicles that travel daily to and from that plant. The lives of local  residents have been made miserable, and I mean miserable. Residents have come  to me in tears as a result of this matter, and others have had to sell up and  move out of the area because of the impact that the existing plant has had on  the quality of their lives. If we factor into that the additional, heavy  traffic that will be generated by the transportation of chicken waste to the  new plant, I cannot understand how the quality of life for residents will be  improved. Indeed, it will have the opposite effect.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText"><strong>The environmental  impact must also be considered. Mr Ford is correct</strong>: this is an  environmentally sensitive area that is close to Lough Neagh. Not just the  visual impact is in question; the impact on the environment as a whole must  also be considered. The issue is location sensitive. If one were searching for  somewhere in Northern    Ireland to locate a plant of this sort, one  certainly would not put it beside Lough Neagh, which is one of our greatest  natural resources. That must be taken into account.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The impact on tourism is also a factor, but the  environmental impact is the major factor that the Department should consider  when a planning application is made. The impact on the roads will also have to  be considered. These are narrow country roads &mdash; it is a rural area, and the  roads were not built to take the heavy traffic that is to be anticipated. At  the very least, Rose Energy needs to look for an alternative site if it is serious  about the proposal. This environmentally sensitive area is the wrong site for  the plant, which will have a detrimental impact on the lives of local  residents.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I have spoken to poultry farmers who have lobbied me on  this issue. When the impact that the plant will have on the local community is  explained to them, they have shown themselves not insensitive to it. They are  prepared to consider alternative locations, and they are also open to  considering other processes.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">If a planning application is made, the Planning Service  will have to consider it in due course. However, in those circumstances, the  Department will be within its rights to exercise its authority to hold a public  local inquiry on the matter. The issues are of such a nature and of such  importance that, at the very least, a public inquiry will become necessary if the  plan goes ahead.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr B McCrea: Much has been said about the plant, but it  boils down to five key issues: whether such a plant is needed; the  appropriateness of the Glenavy/Crumlin location; if that location is chosen,  the appropriateness of the technology; how trust may be built with the local  community and its legitimate concerns addressed; and perhaps most  appropriately, whether there is anything that the Minister can do to resolve  this pressing issue.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Is the proposed chicken waste plant required? Members are  aware that the chicken processing industry is under severe pressure. It must  fulfil its obligations under the nitrates directive, and time is of the  essence. Even if the plant were built today, it would not be completed and  commissioned in time for the industry to avoid significant fines; that will  happen regardless. Therefore, part of the reason for the tabling of the  Adjournment debate is to try to see whether we can move with some alacrity.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Members have spoken about the scenic beauty around Glenavy  and the fresh water in Lough Neagh; however, I can see only two compelling  reasons for the choice of the Glenavy/Crumlin area as the location for the  plant: either planning permission was granted previously, or a site is there  already. We have heard the difficulties associated with that, and such a  decision should not be made simply because it is the easy option. The Assembly  should be able to take a more strategic view, and weigh up the options before  deciding where in Northern    Ireland is the best place for the  chicken-waste plant to be located.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Although some Members have argued in favour of the  technology, areas in the Republic of Ireland and in the United Kingdom have rejected that  technology, because they are unhappy with it. We should, at the very least,  investigate those issues and discover the truth. Until we know that, how can we  recommend that route to anyone? There are issues , not only associated with the  transport of the waste into the area, but with the toxins that are pushed back.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Many Members will have joined the debate about smoking and  the causes and difficulties associated with passive smoking. The emission of  toxins from a plume is a similar issue, as are the low levels of asbestos. The  quantities involved are minute, but people will have legitimate concerns if  they are not assured that their concerns are being tackled. Not only the  surrounding area of Glenavy will be affected, but, depending on the wind  direction, the whole of Northern    Ireland.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, there is the matter of trust. I attended a  meeting with the Minister of the Environment about another state-of-the-art  facility at Mullaghglass. We were assured that it was state-of-the-art; that  there would be no smells from it; that it would not attract rats; and that  there would not be any fall-out. However, the local residents have had their  difficulties. The Minister told me that if those issues were not sorted out, we  could not expect to build plants anywhere else. There is an issue of public  confidence and trust.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Several concerns must be addressed. The roads  infrastructure is incapable of handling the loads that will be brought to the  plant. There is also an issue with smell; with that come other hazards that do  not smell but which are more deadly &mdash; carcinogenic products, such as odourless  gases and toxins. It has been suggested &mdash; and the Royal Commission agreed &mdash;  that if plants such as the one proposed for Glenavy are considered safe, they  should be built in industrial plants where the water and electricity that is  produced can be used.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The companies concerned recognise the need to draw water  from Lough Neagh and put it back for cooling, and that will have an  environmental impact. My request to the Minister is similar to Mr <strong>Donaldson&rsquo;s</strong>: can she intervene on that  issue before a planning application is made, or can she instigate an  appropriate review? When we discussed the environmental protection agency, the  Minister assured us that she would make decisions and could tackle related  issues. I call upon her to do so. As Mr Ford said, it is not fair to ask  industry to undertake the burden of this issue, or to tackle a problem that  belongs to the whole of Northern    Ireland. Not only is the Minister of the  Environment responsible, she has the ability to influence. I call upon her to  institute a review.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr McLaughlin: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann  Comhairle. I support the residents of Glenavy and the Lough Neagh area in their  call to the Minister of the Environment either to reject the proposal outright  or to initiate a local public inquiry to consider the full environmental impact  of building the proposed chicken-litter waste incinerator in an area that is  designated as being of high scenic value.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">6.45 pm</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I accept that, as a society, we must devise a sustainable  means of disposing the waste that we generate. We can, and should, do so  without resorting to incineration or landfill, as neither of those options can  be honestly described as sustainable. The impression being given by those in  favour of the incinerator-based proposition is that there are no alternatives,  but the simple fact is that there is more than one solution to meeting the  terms of the nitrates directive. I hope that common sense will prevail and that  other processes will be given full and open-minded consideration.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr T Clarke: Will the Member give way?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr McLaughlin: I will not give way now, but I  understand that the Member is particularly exercised by this issue, so I may  give way later if I have time.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I share the residents&rsquo; justifiable concerns about the long-term  environmental impact and the health implic&shy;ations for the community, among  other issues, particularly in light of the fact that viable alternative  solutions to the waste issue &mdash; such as anaerobic digestion, linked to a  combined heat and power installation &mdash; are available, and are tried and tested  technologies.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">If necessary, anaerobic digestion can be done on a smaller  scale and in closer proximity to where the chicken litter is generated. That  would eliminate the need for transportation, in contrast to the present  proposal, which would necessitate the wholesale importation of chicken waste  into the Glenavy area to facilitate and support the incineration option. That  would generate additional pollution through the increased heavy vehicular  traffic. As other Members have said, the proposed development also involves the  very real potential of causing serious water pollution in the Lough Neagh area  &mdash; an area which, in addition to being hugely important from an environmental  perspective, is a major source of drinking water. Therefore, in the long term,  the proposal involves an unnecessary risk to public health.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">This is not a case of people arguing &ldquo;not in my back yard&rdquo;  &mdash; at least, not by the residents of Glenavy. However, considering that there is  no significant poultry production in the proposed location, it would be a  legitimate argument for them to make.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I fully acknowledge Trevor Clarke&rsquo;s point about avian flu,  but, if a calamitous outbreak were to occur, presumably the generation of  chicken waste would also cease. Therefore, I do not believe that he has given a  legitimate alternative to the point that Mr Ford was making at the time. We  must question the motivation for building such a facility in a location to  which it would be necessary to transport the waste. There is little or no  production of poultry &mdash; or of poultry waste &mdash; in that area. That is, unless  those who are engaged in this industry are themselves subscribers to the Nimby  concept and would prefer to export their problem to Glenavy.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I call on the Minister to listen to the concerns of the  local population and to use her powers to reject this proposal, and I call on  the promoters of this ill-considered project to abandon it.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment (Mrs Foster)</strong>: Although it is always good to hear Members&rsquo;  views &mdash; and I have listened with great interest to the support for, and  opposition to, the proposed development at Glenavy &mdash; it is unfortunate that the  debate is taking place in something of a vacuum. By that I mean that the  Department has not yet received any planning application for the development.  It is therefore very difficult for me to respond to some of the comments made  by Mr Burns about the height of different installations. I do understand that  there have been several engagements between the Committee for Agriculture and  Rural Development and the Committee for the Environment on the matter.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Members are right to point to the origin of the issue,  which is the nitrates directive that was introduced by Europe  in 1991. Since then, our own nitrates action programme has come into effect,  and the practice of spreading poultry litter and bedding on agricultural land  has effectively ceased. In that context, Mr Burns&rsquo;s comment about the issue  affecting three constituencies is incorrect &mdash; the problem affects the whole of Northern Ireland, and a solution must be found  for the whole of Northern    Ireland.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">During the development of the Nitrate Action Programme  Regulations (Northern    Ireland) 2006, it became evident that  off-farm solutions for the pig and poultry sectors needed to be advanced.  Therefore, in 2005, a working group called &mdash; and this is a very good title, Mr  Deputy Speaker &mdash; the expert group on alternative uses for manure was  established, with representatives from DARD, DOE, DETI, the pig and poultry  sectors, and the environmental non-governmental organisations, under DARD&rsquo;s  chairmanship.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The technical approach that is being proposed by Rose  Energy Ltd was endorsed by that expert group. I listened to the points that my  friend, the Rt Hon Member for Lagan Valley Mr Donaldson, the Member for Lagan  Valley Mr Basil McCrea and Mr Ford made about alternative ways to deal with the  issue. However, the expert group, which was &mdash; correctly &mdash; established under the  chairmanship of DARD, and includes officials from DOE and DETI, has identified  that the waste plant is the correct technology to use. On many occasions, I  have asked myself if there is an alternative. The answer has always been that  the experts have examined the issue, and this is the only way forward.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">If there are alternatives, my colleague the Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development would be only too happy to examine them. As  Members know, at present EHS is responsible for regulation and will be  succeeded by the new Northern    Ireland environment agency. Therefore, I  will be the regulator, and the DARD Minister and the DETI Minister will be  seeking an answer to the problem.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">When this topic was proposed for the Adjournment debate,  there was much discussion about which Minister would answer the debate because  it is a not only a problem for DARD and DETI because of jobs or for my  Department because of the planning application and a permitting viewpoint, it  also concerns OFMDFM with regard to sustainable development. Therefore, the  Minister from any of those Departments could have responded.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The expert group on alternative uses of manures was  assigned to investigate technical solutions for uses other than land spreading.  As I said, it recommended that poultry litter be dealt with in a fire generator  for the poultry sector. That recommendation helped to persuade the European  Commission to allow a temporary measure in the Nitrates Action Programme  Regulations (Northern    Ireland) 2006 for the storage and  application of poultry litter in field heaps until 31 December 2008. As the  derogation finishes at the end of this year, there is a great deal of urgency  to find a solution to the emerging nitrates problem. The difficulties that face  the farming sector, particularly poultry processors, have been recognised by  all the Members who spoke in the debate.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Moy Park Ltd and O&rsquo;Kane Poultry Ltd came together as a  consortium to pursue a solution to the emerging nitrates problem, and &mdash; as the  House has heard &mdash; they were joined by Glenfarm Holdings Ltd. The consortium is  called Rose Energy Ltd and proposes to construct a biomass plant on a site  adjacent to an existing Glenfarm Holdings Ltd facility at Glenavy. I listened  to the various concerns that Members raised about the Ulster Farm By-Products  plant at Glenavy, and I have answered several <strong>questions about that plant from two of the Members opposite. There have  been difficulties</strong>: the company was regulated by Lisburn City Council until  November 2005, after which the Environment and Heritage Service permitted the  installation under the Pollution Prevention and Control Regulations (Northern Ireland)  2003.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Since November 2005, departmental officials have regularly  inspected the operations at the site and have responded to and investigated  complaints from many of the local residents. They also attempt to keep  residents informed of the work ongoing to minimise further the environmental  impact of the site, particularly the odour, which was referred to in the  debate.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Over several years, Rose Energy Ltd has worked closely with  Invest NI and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment to confirm the  feasibility of its proposal and investigate potential ways of aligning the  necessary funding to support the project &mdash; it was a feasibility plan that was  part-funded by Invest NI that suggested the site at Glenavy. It is envisaged  that the proposal would reduce not only the nitrate input, but also the  phosphorous input, to which Mr Ford referred, from agriculture that contributes  to eutrophication, which is the most widespread pollution problem facing  Northern Ireland&rsquo;s water environment.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, the proposed burning of poultry litter, and meat-and-bone  meal would produce 30 MW of electricity, which would help Northern Ireland  achieve its obligation to generate 12% of its electricity from indigenous  renewable resources by 2012. It is in that context that Members should take  Billy Armstrong&rsquo;s well-made comments about the need for renewable energy.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Burns wondered whether the plant would be used for waste  disposal or for electricity generation. Such uses are not mutually exclusive,  and part of its benefit, if the plant were to be built, would be the provision  of electricity generation.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Although departmental officials have held pre-application  discussions with agents, the planning application and the necessary  environmental statement have not yet been submitted. I am sure that when they  are submitted, they will be given intense consideration.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I realise that the proposal has already generated  considerable opposition, and there has been much public debate about the  impacts of the proposal, and, indeed, the manner in which I might deal with the  planning application. I must also acknowledge that I have received substantial  support from others in the community who feel that there is a need for such a  plant. Therefore, there are two sides to the debate.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The planning application will be dealt with under the  procedures for the handling of major applications, as laid out in article 31 of  the Planning (Northern    Ireland) Order 1991. Under those provisions,  a final decision on such an application rests with me, as Minister. Therefore,  it would be inappropriate for me to express any view that suggests that I have  already adopted a position on the matter before it has been given full  consideration through the formal planning process.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I look forward to the planning application being submitted,  because the debate has been going on for some time, and there is a need for  focus. When the planning application is received, with its environmental statement,  I hope that Members who are concerned about the issue will take the time to  read the entire application and statement. That may take the entire summer, but  I know that they will take the time to do that.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The article 31 process that I referred to will allow me, if  necessary, to ask the Planning Appeals Commission to hold a local public  inquiry to consider any other procedural issues. That is one option that will  be available to me at the end of my deliberations.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Much has been said about alternatives. When Mr Butler &mdash; who  secured the debate &mdash; talked about alternatives, I thought that his colleague  the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development would be delighted to hear of  them, because I know that she is exercised about the issue, as, indeed, am I. I  have no current knowledge of any technology that can deal with poultry litter  in the required manner. If alternatives exist, we will be glad to hear about  them.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Members will be interested to know that, as well as  planning permission, Rose Energy will also be subject to the Pollution  Prevention and Control Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2003.  Furthermore, the issuing of any permit is currently a matter for the  Environment and Heritage Service.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The permit process requires the submission of an application  that details how the plant will use the best available techniques to ensure  that all measures are taken to prevent pollution. The application would have to  demonstrate that the installation will be designed, constructed and operated in  accordance with best available techniques. In particular, it would have to be  in line with the requirements of the European directive on waste incineration,  which would entail the provision of rigorous and transparent information on the  process and technology proposed for the installation.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I note the calls from colleagues about the importance of  intervention and the requirement to resolve the issue. Mr Ford, in particular,  addressed that issue.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that, by now, I have made it clear that this is a  cross-cutting issue. DARD takes the lead role because it is trying to find a  solution to the issue of agricultural waste. I clearly have an interest in the  issue, not simply from a planning-permission point of view, but as a regulator.  Therefore, the Department of the Environment will continue to be engaged. The  Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment will also continue to be  involved, because of the fact that so many jobs are involved. I hope that  OFMDFM become involved in respect of sustainable development. Very many issues  need to be resolved, and I look forward to receiving the planning application.</p>
