                debate. It is a perfect example of how the system – the
                devolved Assembly, the legislative procedure, and the lobbying
                process — is operating.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In November last year, the Royal Society for
                the Protection of Birds (RSPB) wrote to its 10,000 members
                asking them to write to their Assembly Members and voice their
                concerns about the loss of our rich natural heritage. They are
                calling on us, as Assembly Members, to do something to update
                the law in Northern Ireland, which is 15 years out of date.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The RSPB and other environmental groups such
                as Friends of the Earth, Conservation Volunteers and the World
                Wildlife Fund, have been working on this issue for some time.
                They have been campaigning and lobbying to get the law passed
                because they are concerned about the neglect of the wildlife and
                habitats in our countryside.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Wildlife, so familiar to us in recent times,
                is now in steep decline and is in danger of disappearing. I am
                not exaggerating. Can anyone remember the last time they saw a
                hare running through the fields? The common corncrake is no
                longer a regular breeding bird in Northern Ireland. Wetlands,
                peatlands and bogs are being lost at an alarming rate. The
                wildlife that depends on those areas, such as the lapwing, the
                curlew and the oystercatcher, is also being lost. These birds
                frequented our shores and were a delight to our eyes, but they
                have declined by 50% over the last dozen years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We share this small piece of land on the
                outskirts of the European continent with a wealth of birds,
                plants, and animals, many of which are quite rare and of
                international importance. However, I contend that we have not
                shared it fairly. Inch by inch and acre by acre, modern
                agriculture and built development are slowly encroaching on our
                most cherished natural resource. They are eating at its core and
                leaving behind a sprawling mess of concrete, tarmac and
                apartment blocks. Is that the legacy we want to leave to our
                children? I think not. Without proper protection, a walk in our
                countryside could become a faded sepia-tone memory, like a steam
                train ride, donkeys on the beach, or blackberry picking.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We still have an awful lot to be proud of.
                However, the need to protect what is left has never been greater
                than at the moment. Under the Nature Conservation and Amenity
                Lands (Northern Ireland) Order 1985, our most important wildlife
                sites have been designated as areas of special scientific
                interest (ASSIs).</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you mention ASSIs to the uninitiated, they
                tend to think of people dressed in moon clothes picking up
                specimens and looking at them, but scientific interest is
                actually about botany, habitat, wildlife, birds, bees, plants
                and flora.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are approximately 179 designated ASSIs
                in Northern Ireland. They represent approximately 6% of the
                countryside. I understand that this is relatively low compared
                to England and Wales, although perhaps not Scotland. The
                potential for increasing the number of designated sites in
                Northern Ireland is huge, because we have so much to be proud
                of. Designation provides fundamental protection for what are
                definitely internationally important sites. Strangford Lough and
                Lough Neagh are two well-known examples.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, designation alone is not enough.
                Sites are vulnerable, and, in fact, the greatest threat is
                neglect. Neglect is a serious problem, but sites are also
                threatened by the development of land and changes in how land is
                used. In England and Wales it was recognised that the protection
                of these sites had to be respected, and following a period of
                consultation, the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 was
                passed there in November last year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion calls specifically for equivalent
                measures to be extended to Northern Ireland. This is important,
                because it would mean that a number of measures, which have not
                yet managed to make the parliamentary passage across the Irish
                Sea, will be included. I want to go into some detail of the
                measures in what is known as the CROW Act (Countryside and
                Rights of Way Act 2000) that we would like to have extended to
                Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nature conservation orders, for example,
                which were never introduced in Northern Ireland, could be used
                as emergency measures to stop sites being damaged. Another very
                important element is third-party damage — damage to the area
                by outsiders — and I am sure we all know of examples of this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One very interesting element of the CROW Act
                is the duty of care. This is about all public bodies — health,
                education, housing and so on — having a duty of care to regard
                and respect to ASSIs. It is vital that the Act be introduced
                here, and greater use should be made of positive management
                agreements, which is about doing something proactive to protect
                these sites. It could be anything — and there are certainly a
                great number of ideas out there — from providing litter bins
                and dog-litter bins to the protection of flora and fauna.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another important measure is the ability to
                manage land outside and adjacent to the designated area,
                ensuring that it does not harm the site in any way. There is
                also a duty to further the conservation of these sites and their
                biodiversity.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.45 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In November this was the message that the
                RSPB asked its members to relate to their elected
                representatives. I started receiving letters from my
                constituents at the beginning of December. I would like to quote
                from a few of those letters. I will not name the writers, but
                they are obviously residents of Bangor, Donaghadee and Holywood.

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Since coming here to live 13 years ago,
                we have both found that Northern Ireland wildlife —
                particularly its bird population — a constant source of
                delight. We ask you to press for time to be made in the Assembly’s
                legislative timetable for a measure which would continue to
                afford the wildlife here the protection it merits.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another person writes</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;As one of the Assembly Members for
                North Down, you will be well aware of the deep concern felt by
                many people in this area at the creeping development which is
                eating more and more into the Northern Ireland countryside&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is a very important point raised by one
                of my constituents — the erosion of the green belt. Another
                very interesting point was this:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Such a measure would not be contentious
                and would at least show the outside world that politicians on
                all sides of the Assembly can at least agree on one thing that
                will benefit all sections of the community. The quality of our
                countryside is one thing we are all agreed upon and a better
                protected environment would be a big selling point to the
                outside firms coming into the area.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I have a letter from a former
                biology teacher at Regent House, Mrs Pat Heatley, who said she
                used to take secondary school pupils to Ballymacormick Point to
                look at specimens in the rock pools. The rock pools are now
                virtually sanded over because the groynes have been misplaced
                and the sand has built up. Mrs Heatley is very disappointed at
                what has been happening and is calling for help. These letters
                speak for themselves and show just how much pressure is on us to
                do something about the matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Not being an expert on the subject, I wrote
                to the Environment Committee asking them to explore the
                situation. Eventually — after the Christmas break and with
                more letters coming in —I decided that the best option would
                be to put a motion to the Assembly. This is a devolved matter
                and it is a specific legislative request entirely within the
                competence of the House. The motion was prepared and sent to the
                Assembly’s Business Office at the start of last week.
                Meanwhile, I wrote to my constituents letting them know to watch
                out for the motion coming to the Floor of the House within four
                to six weeks. It was a surprise to all of us to learn that
                within seven days of this motion being put it was introduced and
                appears at the top of the agenda today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is an example of how the system is
                working. One of my correspondents said simply</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;I realise that the recently announced
                legislative programme for the Assembly will keep MLAs extremely
                busy. I wish you luck in your part in the normalisation of
                political life in Northern Ireland.&quot;</p>

                has no members on my Committee, where the issue is being dealt
                with. Therefore I am delighted that they have brought the matter
                to the attention of the House. I will try, in the short time
                available to me, to inform the House of the progress already
                made on this important issue by the Committee. The debate is
                proof that the environment is viewed as an increasingly
                important topic by the people of Northern Ireland and their
                elected representatives. In the past, many of these important
                issues seem to have been buried under direct rule. Today we have
                an opportunity to debate them openly and to demand that action
                be taken.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The debate will not only highlight problems
                in the environment, but it will seek to press the Minister and
                his Department into action. Under the Nature Conservation and
                Amenity Lands (Northern Ireland) Order 1985, the Department of
                the Environment is required to declare as an area of special
                scientific interest (ASSI) any stretch of land that requires
                special protection because of its flora, fauna or physical
                features. However, in practice ASSI declaration is confined to
                those sites with the highest degree of scientific value. To
                date, 179 ASSIs have been declared in Northern Ireland. As Jane
                Morrice said, these cover more than 6% of the total land area of
                the Province.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although most ASSIs have remained in good
                condition following declaration, the Department of the
                Environment acknowledged to my Committee, in a letter dated 11
                December 2000, that there are a number of weaknesses in the
                present ASSI legislation. It acknowledged that improvements are
                needed to ensure that sites are adequately protected to satisfy
                EC Directives and to enable expenditure to be targeted to
                achieve conservation benefits. Unfortunately, the weaknesses in
                the legislation have been identified for some considerable time.
                The fact that we are operating under out-of-date legislation
                causes us concern, and that situation must change.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have a reliable report, issued by BirdLife
                International, which states that many of Northern Ireland’s
                ASSIs have been damaged or neglected. It draws attention to some
                key concerns that it has identified — the need for legislation
                to strengthen the site safeguard system; the need for urgent
                progress towards the monitoring and management of sites,
                including restoration; and the need for additional resources to
                address these issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The enactment of the Countryside and Rights
                of Way Act provides a range of measures that will enhance and
                protect the sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs) in
                England and Wales. Unfortunately, the Act does not apply to
                Northern Ireland; it only applies to England and Wales. Therein
                lie some of the difficulties. The Countryside and Rights of Way
                Act imposes a statutory duty on public bodies to manage SSSIs in
                England and Wales to conserve and enhance their value. It gives
                English Nature and the Countryside Council for Wales the power
                to impose management schemes on owners of SSSIs. They can
                enforce them, as opposed to simply preventing damaging
                operations. There will be more serious and wide-ranging
                penalties for damaging SSSIs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given the CROW Act in England and Wales, the
                Department of the Environment’s stated concern and the
                recommendation to approve ASSI legislation presented to the
                Government by a Northern Ireland biodiversity group in October
                2000, the Department has informed our Committee that it is
                considering options to strengthen existing ASSI legislation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is unacceptable that we have fallen behind
                the rest of the UK, and I have no doubt that through the debate
                we will draw the Minister’s attention to the urgent and
                necessary legislation that is needed. The Minister has said that
                he wishes to consult widely on any proposal for change in
                legislation with representatives of farmers, landowners, fish
                interests, voluntary conservation bodies, recreation and tourist
                bodies, district councils, et cetera.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCrea, will you be bringing your remarks
                to an end shortly?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr William McCrea:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask the Minister not to lengthen the period
                of consultation. We need to bring our legislation into line with
                the rest of the UK.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, despite a 14% increase in the
                Department’s overall budget for 2001-02 and a 27% increase for
                the Environment and Heritage Service, the specific bid for
                £3·6 million for important work on environmental programmes
                such as landscape protection and nature conservation was not met
                in the Budget. I trust that the Minister will press for this
                need — and the finances necessary to make a difference — to
                be met by the Administration.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for
                the Environment (Ms Hanna):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. Areas of special
                scientific interest (ASSIs) are of vital importance to us for a
                number of reasons and deserve stringent legislation to protect
                them from destruction or neglect.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland is just beginning to develop
                its potential as a tourist destination. It is important to
                preserve the natural and environmental resource of our landscape
                so as to promote a beautiful place to visit. We must see our
                landscape, habitats and wildlife as assets to tourism and our
                unspoilt countryside as a marketable resource. For ourselves, it
                is important to be able to enjoy the unique surroundings that we
                are lucky enough to have virtually on our doorstep.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An Ulster marketing survey in 1997 showed
                that 60% of the population regarded the quality of the
                countryside as one of the most important aspects of the quality
                of life in Northern Ireland. It is a shame, then, that these
                ASSIs have been damaged, intentionally or through neglect. We
                have the opportunity to give these sites the legislative
                protection they urgently need before irreparable damage is done.
                Biodiversity can be lost very quickly, and cannot be recreated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The sites were designated, as has already
                been said, under 1985 legislation. With the passing of the
                Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 across the water, our
                laws have fallen even further behind. We should be striving to
                meet EC Directive standards and, where possible, surpass them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to highlight a few points that
                are worthy of serious consideration. The management of these
                sites must involve a range of partnerships — all those who
                have an interest in the protection of the environment. The
                Minister of the Environment has said that he will consult widely
                with farmers’ representatives, landowners, recreation and
                tourism bodies and district councils. I hope that this spirit of
                partnership will be a common thread through all issues
                concerning the management of these sites.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also concerned that any site’s
                condition should be systematically monitored, so that far more
                data can be gathered about the sites — particularly for poorly
                known species. More surveys should be conducted of habitats such
                as rivers, unimproved grasslands, and the coast.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, it is important that any legislation
                we introduce has swift and robust enforcement procedures when
                damage does occur. We need suitable deterrents for those who
                would recklessly endanger valuable habitats.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.00 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Naturally the measures outlined —
                management of ASSIs, further surveys and data collection,
                enforcement and legislation — will need greater resources than
                has previously been the case. I hope that the Minister will heed
                the concerns expressed inside and outside the Chamber, and will
                make the protection of our natural heritage a priority for his
                Department.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The timetable for this debate is roughly two
                hours, including the speech by the Minister and the winding-up
                speech by Ms Morrice. Therefore five minutes will be set aside
                for each of the other 16 Members.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Carson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the debate, but I must ask Members
                not to welcome too effusively the proposals that have been
                brought forward in the rest of the UK.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to paint a little bit of the
                background to the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, which
                came onto the statute books on 30 November 2000 for England and
                Wales. The Act was a direct result of Michael Meacher’s
                declaration on 8 March 1999 of new Labour’s commitment to give
                people greater freedom to explore the countryside. Without more
                precise information to the public this Act could turn out to be
                a trespasser’s charter. The Labour Government are hailing the
                right to roam as a democratisation of the countryside. However,
                they have to accept that the rights of the many must not
                prejudice the rights of the few.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Countryside Agency in England and the
                Countryside Council for Wales, which have responsibility for
                implementing the Act, admit that a massive education programme
                is required to understand it. The agencies also have what they
                call &quot;the minor problem of funding&quot;. The Countryside
                and Rights of Way Act includes protection for ASSIs and areas of
                outstanding natural beauty, with tough penalties for owners or
                occupiers damaging the sites. Some related problems were
                resolved during the Act’s passage at Westminster. For example,
                tougher action will be taken against the use of illegal vehicles
                such as quad bikes in the countryside. That is a problem that is
                occurring here. Landowners were pleased that they were no longer
                liable for accidents involving natural land features.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately many issues remain unresolved,
                including the definition and enforcement of trespass, the
                definition of the terms &quot;moor&quot;, &quot;heathland&quot;,
                &quot;down&quot;, &quot;mountain&quot; and also the problem of
                communication about the Act and enforcement of the Act. The
                issues of wardening and policing the Act remain to be sorted out
                too, and there is also the big problem of funding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Labour Government have been so eager to
                implement one of their manifesto promises that the Act in GB has
                become law with incomplete research, misunderstandings and
                without any thought as to the minutiae of how to make it work.
                It is not enough for the proposers of the motion — and we are
                all keen to preserve our countryside — to ask the Minister of
                the Environment to note parts of the enactment covering ASSIs.
                Positive management and tougher penalties mentioned in the Act
                are adequate, but in Northern Ireland we need to ensure that
                Environment and Heritage Service personnel will be deployed in
                sufficient numbers to inspect sites on a systematic basis to
                ensure the protection of these sites. It is no use designating
                sites without some form of policing and protection.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Northern Ireland, we have the opportunity
                to avoid the mistakes that have been made in England and Wales
                before we put anything on our statute books. I await with
                interest the Department of the Environment’s proposals and
                consultation with other bodies. The Assembly can then decide if
                those proposals are competent for the protection of our areas of
                outstanding natural beauty and special scientific interest. We
                can then take the appropriate action to make firm legislation to
                preserve our threatened sites.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M Murphy:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I
                would like to see the legislation brought up to date. The
                Countryside and Rights of Way Bill should be given priority in
                order to bring the Nature Conservation and Amenity Lands
                (Northern Ireland) Order 1985 up to date.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In south Down, you will find the eastern
                Mournes, Murlough, Carlingford, Rostrevor woods, the Quoile and
                Strangford. There are many instances of these sites being
                damaged, or suffering neglect due to the lack of more positive
                measures for their protection. As they are so important to our
                present and future enjoyment of wildlife and the environment and
                for the tourist industry, I urge all Members to support the
                motion and ask that legislation be brought up to the same
                standard as that in the rest of Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Burren area in County Clare, for example,
                is recognised worldwide as an area of outstanding natural
                beauty. The wildlife there — and the whole area — are
                protected under that Government’s legislation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If one wanders around our very important
                sites, one can see that wildlife has been reduced to an
                appalling standard. As the proposer said, the hare has totally
                disappeared from the scene, together with a lot of other
                wildlife.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, the old song asked &quot;Where have

                wildlife gone?&quot; Go raibh míle maith agat.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion and commend Jane Morrice
                for bringing it forward. I also commend the Royal Society for
                the Protection of Birds (RSPB) and its members for the extremely
                effective lobbying operation, which has been carried out on many
                of us. I knew, from Eileen Bell, how many letters were being
                sent out in North Down, as I am sure you did also, Mr Deputy
                Speaker. I can assure Jane Morrice and you that a similar number
                have been issued to Members in South Antrim. I hope they have
                received a positive response from the six of us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has already been said that we, in Northern
                Ireland, are dependent on legislation dating from 1985. We are
                not only 15 years behind; we are rather more than a legislative
                cycle behind. This is because the 1985 legislation, which
                applied to us, was already out of date by the standards of the
                English and Welsh legislation before the introduction of the
                Countryside and Rights of Way Act (CROW) last year. There is a
                serious need to ensure that we update that legislation. I do not
                care whether Mick Murphy wants the legislation to be to the same
                standard as the rest of Ireland or if other Members want it to
                be to the same standard as the rest of the UK. It is time that
                Northern Ireland’s environment was protected to the highest
                standards in Europe.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problems have been well highlighted. I
                would like to look at the responsibilities of the Department and
                the opportunities it now has. Prior to devolution, the DOE was
                the &quot;Department of Everything&quot;. That meant that it was
                the department of polluters like the Roads Service and Water
                Service, as well as those who policed that pollution. We now
                have a great opportunity within the new structure because
                although small in terms of budget and staffing, the Department
                of the Environment is very significant in terms of its impact on
                policy across all the other Departments, and on the future of
                the people and the environment of Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department must take its responsibility
                seriously and take the lead on, for example, the biodiversity
                strategy. Related issues include ASSIs, which are the topic of
                this debate, and planning policies, in relation to which the
                Department needs to be more proactive on environmental issues.
                The conservation of individual species is another important
                issue, and reference was made earlier to the corncrake and the
                Irish hare. The case of the corncrake is a classic example of a
                matter on which the Environment and Heritage Service (EHS) has
                finally got its act together. The EHS, in conjunction with the
                Department of Agriculture and organisations such as the RSPB,
                took action just in time to preside over the last surviving
                corncrakes on the mainland of Northern Ireland. The number of
                corncrakes has been reduced to a small population in Donegal
                with, perhaps, a few survivors on Rathlin Island, if we are
                lucky.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will be astounded, as was the
                Environment Committee, to learn that, although the Irish hare is
                a protected species, the EHS still licenses the catching of
                hares for coursing. Coursing is now &quot;supposedly&quot;
                welfare friendly — I deliberately enclose the word
                &quot;supposedly&quot; in quotation marks — and the hares are
                chased by muzzled greyhounds. The hares are still injured by the
                hounds and captured in a way that must create a degree of
                trauma, which casts great doubt over whether they will be able
                to breed in future, even when released back into the wild. The
                Department has, so far, failed to explain its position to the
                Committee, and it must do so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This year a bizarre situation arose in which
                hares, which had been caught on Rathlin Island, were not allowed
                to be released back to the island, because the EHS were not sure
                which two hares came from Rathlin. Therefore biodiversity on
                Rathlin Island is suffering because licensing is being permitted
                by the DOE. The Department should have a clear focus on its
                duties in the field of biodiversity, but there has been a
                considerable degree of confusion in its behaviour. Meanwhile,
                some designated ASSIs are being lost and, in many cases,
                damaged. In addition, new designations, which were being made
                quite speedily some years ago, are now taking much longer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No doubt, the Minister, within his brief
                prepared by the Civil Service, will have answers to some of
                these points. He will tell us about the shortage of staff, the
                need to upgrade the legislation, his hope that there will be
                movement in the next year or two, and the additional resources,
                which he has obtained from the Department of Finance and
                Personnel. Will he do something radical and dynamic — will he
                tear up that brief? Will he stand up and give us a real
                commitment to instituting consultation? The papers will soon be
                ready for consultation. Will he get on with that process and
                make a commitment that, as soon as the consultation is complete,
                there will be legislation immediately? Will he go to the
                Executive and tell them that biodiversity is important and that
                his Department has to take the lead on that? And will he come
                back to the Assembly with legislation, rather than a mere
                promise, at the earliest possible date?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support most of the comments made by Ms
                Morrice. I am going to focus specifically on the north Down and
                Strangford Lough areas. Ms Morrice referred justly to some of
                the difficulties that exist in her area of north Down. At the
                recent launch of the ‘North Down and Ards Area Consultation
                Document 2015’, a senior planning officer described Strangford
                Lough and the Ards Peninsula as &quot;the undiscovered
                jewel&quot;. He highlighted the potential for the future
                development of tourism in the area for those who have not yet
                discovered the beauty of Strangford Lough. He went on to say
                that they had to take great care when looking at the future
                development of the area to avoid killing the goose that laid the
                golden egg.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.15 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When elected Members were invited to comment
                upon the consultation process I took the opportunity to say that
                while the goose may be still alive, it has certainly been well
                plucked and continues to be denuded on a daily basis. The sad
                fact is that the consultation document for north Down and Ards
                is really a nonsense. From Portaferry to Donaghadee, from
                Portaferry to Greyabbey and to Newtownards, and from Comber down
                to Strangford village itself, wholesale and uncontrolled
                development is at this moment destroying the beauty of the
                Strangford area. I see little sense in designating areas of
                special scientific interest (ASSIs) or areas of outstanding
                scenic beauty in Northern Ireland at the moment. Despite the
                current consultation process which allows elected
                representatives to plan the protection of our environment,
                disgraceful planning decisions are being made in many areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It amounts to wholesale destruction of the
                environment, under the authority and with the permission of the
                Department of the Environment’s Planning Service. Again, the
                fact that large housing schemes are currently being approved
                from Portaferry up the entire length and on both sides of the
                peninsula makes a nonsense of the consultation process. The
                single largest development of any area in Northern Ireland is
                under way in the village of Ballyhalbert. It will provide 1,300
                dwellings.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How are the Department of the Environment’s
                Planning Service and Roads Service going to protect the very
                delicate nature and balance of the environment in Stranford
                Lough, if they continue to allow self-certification by builders?
                This problem is giving rise to the wholesale conversion of
                caravan parks to large-scale housing developments throughout the
                Province. This is totally out of kilter with the aims of the
                consultation process and will destroy any opportunity we have to
                protect the environment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is not a matter of personal interest. I
                am not saying &quot;We need more housing, but not in my
                backyard.&quot; I want proper thought given to development, and
                decisions to be taken that will have the least impact on the
                environment; decisions that will be sustainable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition to our problem of a delicate
                roads infrastructure which cannot deal with this increase, we
                face the difficulty of raw sewage being pumped out onto the
                beaches. Because of the increase in development, sewage is
                issuing from Donaghadee and towns along that part of the coast
                and polluting the waters of Strangford Lough and the sea in
                areas like Greyabbey.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There should be a moratorium on major housing
                schemes, particularly in the Strangford area, until consultation
                has taken place and the Planning Service has taken on board the
                very real concerns of the residents of north Down and the
                Strangford area.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Douglas:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will support any motion seeking to press
                for the enhancement and protection of our countryside where many
                people enjoy leisure time. Where areas of special scientific
                interest (ASSIs) are properly managed in agreement with
                landowners, the designation is a very appropriate way in which
                to manage our natural heritage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my constituency of East Londonderry,
                various areas are designated ASSIs — Magilligan, the Bann
                estuary, Lough Foyle and Banagher Glen are examples. The
                Department of the Environment has worked with the landowners in
                these areas to develop a management plan or to purchase, as
                appropriate, certain portions of land. These areas are of great
                importance to wildlife, and none more so than the area nearest
                to my home, Banagher Glen, which is one of the oldest naturally
                regenerated woodlands in the whole of Ireland. The site is
                virtually unusable for farming and is inaccessible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The designation of Banagher Glen as an ASSI
                did not impact greatly on the landowners, and they were happy to
                participate in the scheme. My only proviso concerns access. Over
                the years the Department of the Environment and other Government
                agencies have dragged their feet in giving the public access to
                Banagher Glen. I speak of an area that I know well, and there
                are probably many other such areas around the Province where the
                same applies. Therefore, I ask that before any privately owned
                land is designated as an ASSI, Government agencies promote,
                encourage and strengthen these designations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Are landowners protected if someone proceeds
                onto their land, which is either a designated ASSI or provides
                access to an ASSI? If someone is injured, are the landowners or
                their insurers responsible for any claims? Will the Department
                of the Environment legislate to ensure that injured persons are
                covered by the Department or by some authority or scheme? Under
                any new legislation landowners must be protected from any
                liability for damages claimed by someone who is injured on their
                property. Under a management agreement landowners must be
                adequately compensated for their land, and they should receive
                proper recompense for loss of income.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must also have adequate controls on
                third-party issues relating to damage caused by people who enjoy
                these ASSIs and who may even police them. Some form of
                compensation for damage must be written into any proposed
                legislation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The questions I have raised must be properly
                answered before I can give wholehearted support to further
                legislation to protect ASSIs. I appreciate fully the wealth of
                plant life and wildlife in these areas, and most of the points
                made by the proposer are sound and rational. If my points can be
                adequately addressed, I will welcome such legislation.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr J Wilson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although I will not be able to support the
                motion, and I will outline my reasons, I support much of the
                sentiment behind it. I commend the Women’s Coalition for
                tabling the motion for it is time we debated environmental
                protection and it is time to stop the rot.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are being invited to consider an Act of
                Parliament whose application is confined to England and Wales.
                We can and will make our own decisions on whether we replicate
                any of it with legislation in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I believe firmly that we need to do much more
                to protect the rural environment and the wildlife habitat, but I
                also believe that the Countryside and Rights of Way Act should
                not be cloned for this process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a deeply flawed piece of legislation,
                and it received a mixed reception in rural areas. It had a
                stormy passage through Parliament before the Government’s
                urban majority forced it through. One of its main flaws was to
                put the two rather different and vexed issues of access to the
                countryside and protection of the countryside together in the
                same legislation. The framers of the Bill failed to understand
                how stewardship of the countryside — a largely voluntary and
                unrewarded activity — works.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland’s land ownership structure
                is different from England’s. Moreover, the proportion of
                cultivated land is higher here, although that could be reduced
                gradually in a way that could help farmers diversify and
                contribute to repairing some of the extensive damage already
                done to our wildlife habitat.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While the Department of the Environment has
                guidelines and regulations that appear to protect the natural
                environment, those are honoured much more in the breach than in
                the observance. While environmental protection standards in the
                rest of the UK are undemanding compared with those of many of
                our European neighbours, the situation is even more lax in
                Northern Ireland. Visitors to Northern Ireland who have an
                interest in these matters are frequently appalled by what is
                permitted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was told recently that more planning
                applications for new single rural dwellings are given in
                Northern Ireland each year than in the whole of England. If this
                is true, it is no wonder that our countryside is disappearing so
                rapidly. With ASSIs, it appears that exceptions are the rule.
                Environmentally damaging activities occur frequently, with
                little or no redress.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Planning Service lives in fear of what
                appear to be battalions of sharp lawyers retained by developers
                to bully the Planning Appeals Commission (PAC). The problem
                stems from a presumption in favour of development. That lies at
                the heart of the regulations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we are serious about protecting our
                environment then I urge the Minister, as a matter of urgency, to
                revise the planning regulations so that the balance tilts
                heavily towards the conservation of wildlife habitat and away
                from what appears to be almost indiscriminate development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tourism is an industry that should have
                considerable growth potential in Northern Ireland. If we
                continue in this way there will be no untarnished landscape left
                for tourists to enjoy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members know that I am considerably
                interested in angling. While improving the habitat for fish in
                our river system falls outside the scope of the debate, the
                issue also requires urgent and serious consideration if we are
                to address environmental issues properly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Monumentally bad decisions by the Planning
                Service during direct rule have done serious damage to our
                countryside. I say &quot;monumentally&quot; because I could show
                examples of bad planning monuments in the countryside where I
                live. They are not tourist attractions. A carbon copy of the
                Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 will not bring about the
                change needed. However, change there must be, as the Minister,
                Mr&nbsp;Foster, knows. I appeal to him not to consider the
                Countryside and Rights of Way Act as a solution to Northern
                Ireland’s problems and seek to implement it here.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recommend support for the motion,
                particularly since it seeks to augment the work already set in
                motion by the Environment Committee. As the Chairperson said,
                the Committee has actively engaged with the Department on this
                matter since November, when I drew attention to concerns
                expressed by members of the Royal Society for the Protection of
                Birds (RSPB) and others.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Support for the motion should not be taken as
                criticism of the Department or of the Environment and Heritage
                Service (EHS). Much good work is already being done and if time
                allowed I could provide some details. However, I am sure the
                Minister will not miss the opportunity to reassure us of the
                Department’s good intentions.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion is timely. The Department has
                acknowledged that there are a number of weaknesses in the
                present ASSI legislation, but it has yet to establish a firm,
                timetabled action plan. In its response to the Environment
                Committee’s initial enquiries, the Department said that it
                intended to begin the ASSI consultation process &quot;in the
                near future&quot;. The motion may encourage the development of a
                more precise programme in the very near future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion refers specifically to areas of
                special scientific interest, but the Countryside and Rights of
                Way Act 2000 goes much further than that. It is worth reflecting
                on the intentions and consequences of the Act. In a press
                release dated 13 June 2000, the UK Environment Minister said</p>

                many visitors. We must also ensure the full involvement of local
                people, those who live and work in the Areas or manage the land.
                These measures will improve the conservation and management of
                AONBs, boosting their role as part of our living countryside. We
                will continue to ensure that Government funding is available to
                work alongside local authorities in managing AONBs in
                partnership.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should note the reference to the
                importance of partnership in the development of management. We
                should also note the promise of Government funding. Mr Meacher
                referred to the almost threefold increase in funding over three
                years, from £2·1 million to £5·9 million. Can our Minister
                give an equivalent guarantee that adequate funding will be
                available?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The legislation that is necessary to ensure
                that desired objectives are met must strike a balance between
                several competing rights and responsibilities. I have the
                privilege of living in Magilligan on the north coast. It is an
                area of outstanding natural beauty with a number of coastal and
                highland ASSIs. I appreciate the need for legislation to protect
                sensitive habitats and rights of access, and to ensure effective
                action against anyone who abuses or damages protected areas.
                However, we must remember that all land will be in public or —
                more likely — private ownership and that, therefore,
                legislation must also protect the rights of landowners to proper
                use of their land.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The farming community has many concerns that
                require our sympathetic consideration. Some of those concerns
                were expressed last July in the Ulster Farmers’ Union’s
                comprehensive reply to the European Commission on the subject of
                environmental liability. Paragraph 23 of its response urged the
                Commission to</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;ensure that the Natura 2000 sites are
                designated and established prior to the implementation of an
                environmental liability regime. It would be unacceptable to
                impose a liability scheme dealing with damage to biodiversity
                while the sites are still in the process of being proposed and
                agreed.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sure that the Minister will take account
                of such concerns and that he will agree to take a staged
                approach to amending legislation to ensure that similar
                anomalies do not occur. That would be in accord with the
                Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, which has &quot;rural
                proofed&quot; policy, notwithstanding some of the reservations
                that have been expressed. That point was made by Ewen Cameron,
                chairman of the Countryside Agency in a speech delivered on 18
                January 2000. He warned that both local and central government
                must take greater account of the needs of rural areas and
                populations when drawing up policies:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;For too long, the Departments of State
                have developed their policies and initiatives from the
                perspective of the majority who live in towns. It is extremely
                heartening that the Government…is committing itself to
                encouraging a more inclusive approach. By working together,
                across the political spectrum, to improve the understanding of
                rural problems and opportunities, I am certain we can make a
                long-term difference to those who live and work in the
                countryside, as well as those who visit.&quot;</p>

                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. We are extremely
                fortunate to have some of the jewels of United Kingdom wildlife
                in the Province. Rathlin Island is an outstanding area for its
                seabird colonies, maritime heathland and high density of nesting
                birds of prey. Strangford Lough, some of which lies in my own
                constituency is internationally important for several species of
                waterfowl, including the brent goose and knot. Of course, no
                debate would be complete without a mention of west Tyrone and
                the raised bogs in the Fairy Water area near Omagh. We have some
                outstanding habitats, and they are in urgent need of protection
                and conservation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was heavily involved in the consultation
                process on the Wildlife (Northern Ireland) Order 1985 and on the
                Nature Conservation and Amenity Lands (Northern Ireland) Order
                1985. Indeed, I hold the dubious distinction of having suffered
                the heaviest defeat ever inflicted at Stormont when I moved an
                amendment to that legislation, which lost by 56 votes to one.
                Things are getting better. In those days I was a voice in the
                wilderness. That is why it is so encouraging today to hear so
                many people supporting what I was saying 15 to 16 years ago.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What appals me is that the legislation giving
                the Department power to designate areas of special scientific
                interest (ASSI) came in 15 years ago, and we have still not
                completed the designation of all potential ASSIs in Northern
                Ireland. One hundred and seventy-nine have been designated, but
                at least another 50 are in the pipeline. I have to ask why it
                has taken 15 years and we still have not completed the process.
                There is absolutely no protection for habitats that are not
                declared ASSIs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An enormous amount of damage is going on
                throughout the countryside and it is a worrying situation. I
                agree with Mr Jim Wilson when he says that we should not
                automatically duplicate the CROW Bill by simply tweaking it to
                suit the Northern Ireland situation. If he wants stronger
                legislation, then I say &quot;Hear, hear&quot; to that. I
                guarantee that I will be 100% behind even stronger legislation
                if that is the basis of his opposition.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must have something on the table urgently.
                I ask the Minister to unshackle himself from his minders in the
                Department. I ask him to stand up here today and say &quot;I am
                taking this matter by the throat, and I am bringing forward this
                legislation immediately so it can be discussed and debated by
                this House, the Committee and the general public.&quot; I do not
                know about other hon Members, but I have received a large number
                of letters from individuals throughout south Down — from some
                of the most surprising sources, I must say — who are deeply
                concerned about this issue and want us to act now. This is one
                of those measures where we, as an Assembly, can act in unison
                and come forward with something that all of the public will
                agree with.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am deeply concerned that the present
                legislation is entirely negative in character when it comes to
                ASSIs. The Department tells individual landowners what they
                cannot do. There are good reasons for that, but I would like to
                see much more in the way of positive management agreements — a
                partnership — between landowners and the Department to protect
                these outstanding areas. I am also deeply concerned about the
                amount of third party damage to ASSIs throughout Northern
                Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How often have you driven down the roads in
                Counties Down and Armagh and seen small inter-drumlin wetlands
                being destroyed as a result of infilling by waste and rubble,
                and by other materials being dumped in these areas? The reality
                is that many of these sites do not, in their own right, have
                sufficient merit to be designated ASSIs, but taken together they
                are of inestimable importance to wildlife in Northern Ireland.
                One by one they are being ticked off as builders basically dump
                rubble and destroy them. That is a sad aspect of what is going
                on in Northern Ireland at present.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must also introduce legislation that
                protects the wider countryside. ASSIs, even if they are all
                designated, protected and managed, will cover only 7% to 8% of
                the land surface of Northern Ireland. That still means that
                approximately 93% is left totally unprotected. We need to
                introduce policies that will protect the wider countryside.
                There are many species, such as the Irish hare, which will not
                be protected simply by the designation of ASSIs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What would best come out of this debate would
                be for the Minister to give us a firm commitment on the date
                when the equivalent legislation to the CROW Bill will be tabled
                to the Environment Committee. We have raised this issue many
                times with the Department, and it has hidden behind words such
                as &quot;We have plans to introduce&quot;. We want a date, and
                we want a date this morning. When will the matter come before
                the Assembly?</p>

                Each of us can testify that this island is remarkably endowed
                with special conservation areas or areas of special scientific
                interest. Each of us can also testify to the level of interest.
                This is becoming a pressing issue. To some extent public opinion
                is in advance of the opinion of the Department and, thus far,
                the response of the Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I urge support for the motion. I urge Members
                to consider the various ways in which we can promote the
                application of amending or new legislation to bring the Six
                Counties up to the same standards of protection as those enjoyed
                by other areas on this island or in Britain itself, or on offer
                through compliance with European Directives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue is before us, and we must address
                the culture of complacency and lack of accountability in respect
                of this matter that has developed over the direct rule period.
                It has to be welcomed that the Environment Committee, of which I
                am a member, is already addressing this issue. The Minister will
                find that very strong representations will be made there. It is
                not beyond the Committee’s ability to devise its own
                legislation or its own legislative proposal on the matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Either way, it will have to come before the
                Assembly for action. This situation demands that remedial action
                be taken urgently. It is not as if experience elsewhere cannot
                be applied here; it is not as if the templates do not exist; it
                is a question of resources and of the necessary prioritisation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a precedent of convergence of views
                and cross-party support. The only Act that the Nationalist Party
                got through the old Stormont Government was the Wild Birds
                Protection Act 1931. We should consider that as a very useful
                and welcome precedent and see what we can do for society today.

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000
                was controversial when it was debated at Westminster. The Act,
                which comes into force at the end of this month, changes
                relationships between landowners and the public and, in
                particular, those who like to roam on open land.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The situation in Northern Ireland is not
                identical to that in England and Wales — where the Act
                applies. Northern Ireland’s land law has evolved in a
                different way from that in England and Wales. In the early part
                of the last century, many of the great landed estates in Ireland
                were broken up, and tenant farmers became the freehold owners of
                their lands.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Farms in Northern Ireland are mainly small,
                rural and family-owned. Although many farmers will rent land,
                this is usually done on an annual basis. In this context, the
                question of roaming over areas of mountain, moor, heath and
                down, as the English Act describes, does not apply in Northern
                Ireland in the same sense as it would in England and Wales.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The term &quot;registered common land&quot;
                is unknown in Northern Ireland and reflects a time in English
                history when certain areas were retained for the use of the
                people, in contrast to the rights of those who occupied the
                manor house.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At some stage the Assembly may have to
                examine the right-to-roam situation in Northern Ireland, but at
                this point I am not aware of any general feeling of public
                deprivation as regards rights over open land.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my constituency — Lagan Valley — it is
                possible to roam in many areas of outstanding beauty. The Lagan
                Valley regional park is an open area that welcomes the public,
                and future development of the Lagan corridor will further
                enhance its amenities. The Belfast hills are an area of high
                scenic quality. The Dromara hills lie to the south, just outside
                my constituency. The Mourne Mountains lie further afield. The
                whole of Northern Ireland is blessed with excellent areas for
                walking and recreation. The public is reasonably relaxed about
                the current situation. If demand for a change in the law should
                grow, we should tread carefully so as not to damage the good
                relationships that currently exist between those who own the
                land and those who wish to ramble.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1999 the environmental policy division of
                the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland issued a
                discussion paper on access to Northern Ireland’s countryside.
                The paper raised a number of questions about the future of
                access and asked for comments. It pointed out that the Access to
                the Countryside (Northern Ireland) Order 1983 placed
                responsibility for the care and maintenance of countryside
                access with district councils. Under the Order, councils were
                permitted to appoint a countryside officer, and many have done
                so. Many have prepared and are preparing an access strategy or
                countryside recreation strategy for their area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this context, the widest possible
                consultation should take place before any motion is put to the
                House to bring forward changes. There are many matters to be
                resolved. The question of occupiers’ liability is of great
                importance. The right of landlords to have protection for their
                livestock and crops must be to the forefront, and the
                possibility of damage to the environment must be monitored.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second part of the motion refers to Areas
                of Special Scientific Interest (ASSIs). The CROW Act provides
                for greater protection of these sites to prevent damage, to
                provide positive management of the sites, and to enhance their
                status. In Northern Ireland, the Planning Service is responsible
                for the treatment of ASSIs. Present controls for ASSIs may be
                adequate, but the issue should be examined by the Planning
                Service when a full review of planning takes place.</p>

                support for the protection of flora and fauna and the
                countryside’s physical features. However, I have concerns.
                Only yesterday, it was clearly stated in the House that animal
                diseases can be spread by pedestrians going from farm to farm.
                There is every reason to believe that that is a real
                possibility. Indeed, some farmers are still in the habit of
                providing disinfectant trays at the entrance to their farms for
                casual visitors. There is a widespread concern that must be
                addressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I fear that the Assembly is seeking to
                introduce legislation that will provide more rights to the
                general public than to landowners themselves. I own a small plot
                of land in an area of special scientific interest (ASSI). If
                Members think that they receive a lot of bumf from the Assembly
                about the Committees that they are on, they should see the
                correspondence that one receives about ASSIs. There are
                mountains of rules and regulations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has got to the stage where one can hardly
                look at the land, never mind go onto it. With that in mind, I
                would just say that the rules should be for everyone. If
                directives are laid down to protect an ASSI, the restrictions
                should apply to the landowners and public alike — there should
                be no difference. I am sure that the Committee and the Minister
                are fully aware of these points.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Bradley, may I interrupt for a moment. I
                have taken some advice on answering Mr Ford’s point, and I
                understand that the right of access and the right to roam are
                included in the Act referred to. It is therefore proper for
                those matters to be mentioned in the House.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Bradley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with Mrs Carson and Mr Douglas, who
                referred to the issues of access and trespass.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee and Minister will have to take
                those matters on board in future — there is no doubt about
                that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I often wonder what level of reciprocation
                those who so energetically promote access to the countryside
                have in mind. Do they foresee the day when farmers and rural
                residents will be permitted to walk unchallenged through the
                gardens and lawns of north Down, for example, to admire the
                beauty within? We have heard about natural beauty. Is it planned
                to allow a farmer just to walk through a garden because it has
                beauty? Is that all part of their intention for the future? My
                closing words to those who are drawing up the legislation are
                &quot;Tread carefully.&quot;</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gibson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First of all, I thank the proposer of the
                motion. Bearing in mind Mr Ford’s warning about ASSIs, I will
                use the term &quot;special areas of conservation&quot; (SACs),
                as designated by the European Directive. In June last year the
                Minister wisely introduced 23 of those, making a total of 43
                such designated areas in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have three simple points. First, a number
                of people have quite rightly highlighted the rights of the
                current owners of property and, as Mr Wells has pointed out, the
                negative approach of some of the former Executive legislation.
                There is now an opportunity to achieve co-operation — for
                those who own the property and the lands, and those who own the
                turbary, to join with the Department in a form of
                eco-management.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is very important that we now move on from
                the negative attitudes of 15 to 20 years ago into a new era of
                assisting those who own the land to form a new partnership in
                eco-farming, using the environment as a proper resource asset.
                Not only is it then protected, but it is managed and controlled.
                Bearing in mind that this is an environmental heritage that is
                ours to protect, it is not only ours to share but ours to care.
                Therefore it is very important that the Minister take on board
                that it is a golden opportunity, as part of the consultation, to
                make sure that there is a partnership involved, and that it is
                not negative as in the &quot;Thou shall not&quot;s of the past.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My second point concerns the issue of being
                able to share with those on the outside who wish to use, view,
                and enhance their own professional education in, the habitat
                that we have, with its varieties of fauna and flora. That has to
                be managed so that there is not abuse. However, we live in an
                age of litigation — people have become quite skilled at it —
                so those who own and manage land have got to be protected. That
                has been a concern in other areas — not just in eco-tourism,
                but in ordinary tourism where the right of the owner is
                challenged.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One good measure that was introduced by the
                Department of Agriculture was community forestry. However, that
                hit the buffers. Even though many farmers were willing to join
                and restore the natural forestry that once existed here, it was
                community forestry and other people had the right of access.
                Therefore the danger of litigation to the landowners became a
                threat. That threat stopped community forestry almost before it
                began — it was a stillborn idea.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have heard about the difficulties of
                concrete jungles and the great haciendas that are being built on
                the Ards Peninsula. May I refer you to the unspoilt beauty of
                West Tyrone. It is an objective of the Habitat Directive of
                Europe that raised bogs be treated as a priority. I advocate
                that Crannagh Bog, Tully Bog and Tonaghbeg Bog — a group of
                raised bogs designated as ASSIs — become SACs. I also suggest
                that the Fairy Water SAC be extended to bring in Lough Envagh,
                the waterhills around Envagh and Ernasculpath raised bogs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">West Tyrone is rich in raised bogs, but they
                are now becoming a rare and important asset. The landowners have
                been careful about that. Bearing in mind that the present
                landowners have been the best caretakers of much of that rich
                heritage in the environmental sphere, I, as other Members have
                done, warn the Minister that the Countryside and Rights of Way
                Act 2000 is not necessarily the legislation to use. However, I
                am sure that the Minister and the Department have enough
                ingenuity to draft legislation that will preserve an excellent
                heritage that we have every right to be proud of.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes, a little.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As an Irish peasant born and reared in Conlig,
                Co Down — near Jane Morrice’s Bangor — I have great
                pleasure in speaking on the motion from a cultural viewpoint.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The countryside, with its beauty, traditions
                and lore, was the inspiration of our finest poets — the Ulster
                Weaver poets of the 1790s and early 1800s, who have given us a
                unique heritage. They were educated in Latin and Greek and
                achieved a higher level of culture than any section of the
                peasantry in western Europe.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They were not merely writing in appreciation
                of Robert Burns, whom we celebrate this week, but they belong to
                a tradition which went back to Allan Ramsay and beyond, in
                Scotland. From my own family came Uncle Ned — Edward Sloan,
                the bard of Conlig — but the most widely acclaimed of the
                Ulster poets was James Orr of Ballycarry, which is near the
                Ulster Unionist Party’s Chief Whip’s residence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like my ancestor, Archibald Wilson, James Orr
                was a radical thinker, patriot, United Irishman, New Light
                Presbyterian, and a humanist with a penetrating social concern
                for the poor. He was a contented weaver and a small farmer who
                never sought social elevation. Until his death, he continued to
                speak the Braid Scotch that we now know as Ulster-Scots.
                Archibald, my ancestor, was hanged outside our village for his
                part in the rebellion. My grandmother said that it served him
                right for entering politics. However, Orr survived and went on
                to write great poetry. In ‘Rhyming Weavers’ my old friend
                the late John Hewitt described some of Orr’s poems as being
                far beyond the capacity of any of our other rural rhymers. Two
                of his poems, ‘The Penitent’ and ‘The Irish Cottier’s
                Death and Burial’, can undoubtedly be described as major
                successes of our vernacular literature.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They are getting rarer now.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The works of Orr provide us with the richest
                information that we have about social customs, traditions and
                everyday living in the Ulster countryside. Many of Orr’s works
                are light-hearted and are intended to entertain rather than
                educate. My favourite is ‘The Ode to the Potatoe’ — &quot;potatoe&quot;
                is, of course, spelt with an &quot;e&quot;, as it should be,
                although such spelling ruined a political career in America. The
                greatest export brought by the Ulster-Scots to America, apart
                from their music, was the potato. I shall read a couple of
                verses of his poem:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Sweet to the badger, aft a lander<br>

                To starch their claes.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Such poems form one of the finest records of
                the beauty of our countryside.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thomas Beggs, another well-known folk poet,
                who was born in Glenwirry in 1789, called Orr &quot;the
                Shakespeare of the plebeian train&quot;. Although many of his
                relatives were poor in material things, they had the rich
                resource of the countryside to sustain them. We must use every
                means in our power to nurture and protect that countryside.</p>

                getting better as he matures. It is good that he has brought
                some lightness to what is an important subject. Many Members
                have put a great deal into our debate, and I welcome that.
                Indeed, the debate is very timely.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is funny that there are different
                prospectives from across the Province. In Fermanagh, ASSIs are
                not popular at all, and people see them as a further planning
                obstacle. Opinions differ from one part of the world to the
                other. With regard to development, I have heard the cynical
                remark that a developer is someone who seeks a house in the
                woods, and a conservationist is somebody who has a house in the
                woods. I welcome the opportunity to outline to the Assembly what
                my Department has done and what it plans to do with regard to
                ASSIs. Before doing so, I shall set out the wider context.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Minister of the Environment, I have as one
                of my main aims the promotion of a more sustainable way of
                living in Northern Ireland. Learning to make wiser use of our
                natural resources, including our countryside and wildlife, is an
                important part of that. We must try to meet our environmental,
                social and economic needs without harming the prospects for
                future generations. As the Executive have recognized, that is
                one of the keys to a more secure and prosperous future for the
                community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all enjoy the natural heritage that we
                have here. We all know of the quality of our countryside and the
                richness of its wildlife. The problem is that it is so easy to
                take such resources for granted and to underestimate the threats
                that they face, until it is too late and the damage has been
                done. I know that many people share my view of the importance of
                that heritage. For example, last autumn the biodiversity group
                produced a wide-ranging report on measures that should be taken
                to protect the variety of species and habitats that we enjoy.
                Moreover, many public representatives, interest groups and
                individuals have asked me to look at our legislation on the
                protection and management of ASSIs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members have put down Assembly
                questions on this during the last few months. I have also
                received a lot of correspondence from interested bodies and
                members of the public. Let me set out how I and the Executive as
                a whole are responding to this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I am grateful for the additional
                resources made available in the recent Budget for work on
                environmental protection and nature conservation. While a large
                part of those funds will go on dealing with matters such as
                pollution control and waste management, wildlife and habitats
                will also benefit from additional funds from the management of
                designated sites and from payments to landowners, voluntary
                bodies and district councils. These will enhance our ability to
                encourage good conservation management at these sites.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, we are committed to producing a
                Northern Ireland biodiversity strategy this year. In that
                respect the advice of the Northern Ireland Biodiversity Group is
                most important. My officials will continue to take full account
                of the group’s recommendations as it prepares that strategy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, my Department will continue to work
                closely with other Departments whose responsibilities have an
                important bearing on the natural environment. One important
                example is trying to integrate conservation into policies for
                the countryside and the rural environment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fourthly, there are a wide range of policies
                for which my Department is responsible which are contributing to
                a healthier countryside for both its people and its wildlife. It
                is important that we do not see the value of the natural
                environment only in terms of individual, rare species and small
                pockets of land which we preserve carefully, with everything in
                between being up for grabs. Maintaining and improving water
                quality, running educational programmes in country parks and
                working with other interested parties to look after major areas
                such as Strangford Lough and Lough Neagh are all part of this
                wider approach. In this there will continue to be an important
                role for protected areas, as is clearly seen by the proposers of
                this motion and by others who have spoken today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000
                applies to England and Wales only. In relation to sites of
                special scientific interest and the protection of wildlife, the
                Act’s provisions introduce new and enhanced powers to improve
                the protection and management of SSSIs in England and Wales —
                for example, the development of management schemes to combat
                neglect, an increase in penalties for deliberate damage and the
                ability to order restoration of the damage to SSSIs, the power
                to refuse consent for damaging activities, and the authority for
                officials to enter land to monitor sites. These new powers have
                been considered necessary because it is evident that a
                significant proportion of SSSIs in England and Wales are in an
                unfavourable condition. Therefore the new legislation will
                create conditions in which sites can be more effectively and
                positively managed. Owners and occupiers will benefit from
                clearer procedures. They will also have new rights of appeal
                against the actions of the conservation agencies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The equivalent sites are known as areas of
                special scientific interest (ASSI) here. My officials have been
                telling me that we have been experiencing similar difficulties
                with our ASSIs. We think that there are weaknesses in the
                current legislation and that those weaknesses are similar to
                those in other parts of the United Kingdom. The present
                legislation does not allow us to take action against persons who
                are neither owners nor occupiers but who are nevertheless
                engaged in activities which are damaging to the sites — in
                other words, third parties. There is also evidence that some
                sites are deteriorating as a result of inadequate or
                inappropriate management. We accept that this is very difficult
                to address within the current legislation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In some cases, where ASSIs have also been
                identified as special areas of conservation or special
                protection areas, these difficulties are risking infringement of
                EC Directives. Consequently my officials have been working on a
                consultation paper on the protection and management of ASSIs.
                This paper raises a number of issues which I feel are crucially
                important to the safeguarding of these special places.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased to be able to announce to the
                Assembly that I will publish the consultation paper within the
                next few weeks. I am also considering, separately, if the
                Wildlife Order should be amended to strengthen the protection of
                certain species. I believe that the consultation paper on ASSIs
                will generate a constructive and wide-ranging debate on this
                important aspect of the conservation of our natural heritage.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister used the phrase &quot;within the
                next few weeks&quot;. Can he be more specific and tell us on
                what date he hopes to table this consultation document for the
                perusal of the Assembly?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Foster:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is difficult to name an actual date, but I
                estimate that it will be within the next six weeks.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also considering separately whether or
                not the Wildlife (Northern Ireland) Order 1985 should be amended
                to strengthen the protection of certain species, as I said. I
                believe that the consultation paper on areas of special
                scientific interest (ASSIs) will generate a constructive and
                wide-ranging debate on this important aspect of the conservation
                of our natural heritage. I will be particularly looking for
                comments and responses from organisations representing
                landowners, farmers, fishermen, industry, environmentalists,
                recreational pursuits and many others, since I consider that we
                will achieve much more by working in partnerships.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The potential of partnerships as a way of
                achieving management is well illustrated by Ballynahone bog at
                Maghera, which I learnt about in the autumn. We set up a
                partnership to manage this national nature reserve, involving
                the Environment and Heritage Service of my Department and the
                Ulster Wildlife Trust. What pleases me most about this
                arrangement is the commitment shown to it by the third partner,
                the locally based Friends of Ballynahone Bog. Having
                successfully campaigned to save the bog, the Friends are not
                stepping aside but taking an active role in plans to look after
                it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we have considered the responses to the
                issues raised during the consultation I will make specific
                proposals for changes to the legislation and any changes
                required to current procedures. My objectives throughout this
                process will be to secure improvements in the procedures for
                notifying sites; to achieve better protection for sites from
                development operations which damage the special interests and
                from deliberate damage; to secure better management of
                designated sites by both public and private landowners; and to
                get better value for money from payments to landowners to
                protect and manage sites by requiring conservation benefits.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A few questions have been raised. I will try
                to answer some of them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr McCrea referred to the resources of the
                Environment and Heritage Service (EHS). An additional £2·5
                million of programme money will be allocated to conservation and
                biodiversity, the management of designated sites, and meeting
                our obligations under European Directives. The EHS will also
                benefit from additional staff to do this work. In the coming
                year 12 new posts will be created in this area of work alone,
                and other new posts will be established in the relocated areas
                of pollution control and waste management.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Assembly Members Carson, Douglas, Wilson and
                Davis were worried about the provisions in the Countryside and
                Rights of Way Act 2000. The consultation that I have announced
                will not include the access provisions. Responses to the 1999
                consultation exercise on access to the countryside pointed up
                the importance of the issue of occupiers’ liability. My
                Department, in conjunction with the Countryside Access and
                Activities Network, has commissioned a study into occupiers’
                liability as it pertains in Northern Ireland. The initial
                findings of that study will soon be circulated through the
                publication of a leaflet, and the consultant appointed will be
                holding two public seminars in the near future. My Department
                expects that a report on the public response to these findings
                will be published in June.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Assemblyman Ford was concerned about hare
                coursing. The regulation of hare coursing is a matter for the
                Department for Social Development, while permits to take live
                hares from the wild are issued by my Department. These permits
                are issued subject to certain conditions. Permission to take the
                hares must be obtained from the relevant landowners. The permit
                also requires that the hares be released back into the area from
                where they were taken. I am advised that there is no strong case
                for withholding permits on the grounds of conservation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, my Department recently published a
                biodiversity action plan for the Irish hare. This plan was put
                together with help from the Department of Agriculture and Rural
                Development and the Ulster Wildlife Trust. Although the number
                of hares has declined markedly in recent years, coursing is not
                identified in the plan as one of the principal threats to their
                survival. However, the plan does propose that the legislative
                protection of the Irish hare should be reviewed, and we will be
                looking at that over the next year.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister confirm that two hares were
                taken on Rathlin Island for last autumn’s coursing and were
                not returned to the island, in contravention of the licence
                under which they were taken? They should be released back into
                the wild in the same area.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Somebody reported at one time that 70 hares
                had been taken from Rathlin Island. I do not know where they got
                that from. I can confirm that two hares were taken from Rathlin
                Island, but as I understand it — and I will confirm it — the
                two hares were returned. If I am wrong, I will give a written
                reply. Nevertheless, it is an important issue and I take the
                point.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Jim Wilson referred to planning control.
                He was very concerned about the need for better planning control
                to protect the countryside. That is a good point. I am
                determined to look at the implications of that for our planning
                control system.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Savage:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is the Minister aware that there are fewer
                houses in the countryside now than there were 25 years ago?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Foster:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware that there are concerns in parts
                of the country about the lack of housing in rural areas.
                Nevertheless, the number of houses that have been built
                throughout the countryside largely equates with that in other
                places. There is concern throughout the farming community about
                the problem of getting houses in rural areas. I have had that
                experience in my own county of Fermanagh.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Arthur Doherty referred to European
                designations. He mentioned the designation of Natura 2000
                European sites. These are designations that satisfy the EU Birds
                and Habitats Directives (79/409/EEC and 92/43/EEC). I am pleased
                to state that my Department is meeting its obligations under
                these Directives. Furthermore, sites that are being added to the
                Natura 2000 network are, in all cases, protected by underpinning
                ASSI declarations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have discussed what my Department is doing
                or is planning to do but, as with all the main environmental
                problems, the solution lies not in regulation alone but in
                actions by all sectors and, indeed, by society as a whole. We
                must acknowledge the value of the environment to ourselves and
                to succeeding generations. Each of us, as an individual, never
                mind whole sectors, can and should make a difference. We must
                work at it ourselves. All sectors — central and local
                government, the private and voluntary sectors — need to work
                together.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I said in relation to Ballynahone Bog, the
                most effective initiatives will be those based on partnership
                between sectors. The work of the Northern Ireland Biodiversity
                Group in making its recommendations last year is another
                excellent example of this. As this debate shows, the interest of
                Members will continue to help both my officials and myself in
                developing our policy. Therefore I sincerely hope that everyone
                — not least this Assembly — will grasp the opportunity
                provided by the forthcoming consultation to develop the type of
                partnership approach, including all those involved in the
                management and use of our natural heritage, that will be so
                vital to our success. I am looking forward to hearing as wide a
                range of views as possible from those interested in caring for
                our natural heritage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome this debate and am pleased to have
                participated in it.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for announcing that the
                consultation will take place within six weeks. Perhaps this
                debate has been a taster for that consultation. We have heard
                many interesting and different views from all parties, so it is
                certainly a forerunner to the consultation that the Minister
                will be carrying out. I look forward to the immediate enactment
                of legislation as a result of that consultation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It may have been an oversight on my part not
                to outline the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 as it
                stands. I understood it to be two separate pieces of
                legislation. The Unionists, and Mr Bradley, were concerned about
                the right to roam and the issue of access. Mr Douglas also
                mentioned it. However, those were two separate pieces of
                legislation, which were put together simply for reasons of
                parliamentary procedure to get them through. The motion relates
                solely to the countryside element and to ASSIs. I am talking
                about equivalent protection. Any legislation that comes through
                to Northern Ireland will not include that access element. We are
                not asking for that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee Chairperson indicated that the
                Committee is looking at these issues and has been pressing the
                Minister to move on this. That is very useful to know.
                Obviously, through a concerted attempt from all of us, we are
                getting movement on this. He also mentioned the penalties for
                damaging ASSIs, and that is very important.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is very appropriate that the Deputy
                Chairperson and Arthur Doherty mentioned the European context
                and the need to keep up to European standards, set by EC
                Directives and European designations. We need to keep up with
                those Directives and to enhance them. Northern Ireland has a
                very poor track record in bringing European Directives
                on-stream. I know from previous experience that Northern Ireland
                was lagging behind in the introduction of European legislation
                on environmental policy. We need to move very quickly on that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Carson, Jim Wilson and Ivan Davis talked
                about the right to roam issue. I hope that I have dispelled any
                fears about that, allowing them to support the motion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was excellent that this motion allowed a
                number of Members to wax lyrical. I mention Mick Murphy from
                Sinn Féin and Ian Adamson. I am thankful for their
                contributions, for one side of the House was quoting Pete Seeger’s
                &quot;Where have all the flowers gone?&quot;, and the other side
                quoted every Ulster poet. It is a perfect opportunity — and
                totally correct — for lyricism to come into this rural
                rhyming.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Very interestingly, David Ford brought up the
                issue of hare coursing on Rathlin Island. I have been approached
                about that subject as well. I thank the Minister for responding
                to that and for adding his voice to the concerns.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford also brought in the whole issue of
                the confusion in the Department. The Minister is really going to
                have to get to grips with the Department’s roles and
                responsibilities with regard to roads, planning, protection of
                the environment, et cetera. As Mr Ford said, there is absolutely
                no doubt that, while in this Assembly we talk politics most of
                the time — or the politics of controversy, let us say — our
                constituents write to us, begging us to talk about issues which
                probably affect the Minister’s Department more than any other
                Department in this Assembly. I get more questions about matters
                such as planning, transport and wildlife conservation than about
                any others. That should impress their importance upon the
                Minister and the Department.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cedric Wilson brought up the vitally
                important issue of planning, and others referred to it — the
                erosion of the green belt and the areas which are being
                encroached upon by planning. If I am right, the Minister admits
                that better planning control is needed. That is certainly
                welcome, and we look forward to hearing positive, concrete
                proposals with regard to the very important issue of the
                consultation process on area plans, et cetera.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Each Member brought up different points on
                this issue. Mr Douglas talked about the cost of injury (for
                example, for people traversing these areas), landlord liability
                and — looking at it from the landlord’s point of view —
                compensation for the land. The consultation process will bring
                in all elements, and I certainly welcome that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that I have not missed out any Members
                in my summing up. Mr McLaughlin and Mr Mick Murphy mentioned the
                need to ensure that standards of protection are equivalent —
                not just within the United Kingdom, including England and Wales,
                but within this island, these islands and Europe in general.
                That is a very important point.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciated Mr McLaughlin’s point
                relating to the only Act that Nationalists supported.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McLaughlin:</p>
                </b>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I refer to the Wild Birds Protection Act of
                1931. That is also an important point.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gibson mentioned the fact that this is a
                golden opportunity. I wholeheartedly agree that the consultation
                process is a golden opportunity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I conclude by stating that this debate is a
                superb example of people power. People, spurred on by the
                lobbing groups and the non-governmental organisations that
                protect the environment, wrote to their Assembly Members; those
                Members acted, and the Minister has given a commitment. That is
                an excellent example of the system’s working speedily, for we
                are almost there.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells is, unfortunately, not in the
                Chamber, but I appreciated his point about having attempted,
                some 15 years ago, to table a motion of this type but having no
                support. I say to Mr Wells that it is marvellous that we have
                all caught up with him now and are able to support this motion
                so many years later.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I talked about people power. In this two-hour
                debate today we have witnessed the normalisation of politics in
                Northern Ireland. It is not just people power that has worked
                today, but also bird power.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That this Assembly notes with grave concern
                the contents of the ‘Informal Criminal Justice Systems in

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I very much resent the curtailment of this
                debate. This is a matter of grave importance. It is a running
                sore in both communities, and, since we meet on only two days a
                week, we should surely take as much time as possible to deal
                with issues with which people are concerned. This is a matter of
                maiming, killing and crucifying people, and the time has surely
                come when this Assembly should order its business and remember
                the strength of the motions that are going before this House and
                the subjects that they are dealing with. To ask me to deal with
                this matter in 15 minutes is ridiculous, but to say to my

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the report of the Economic and

                that most of the Members have got only the summary of the
                report. I understand from the Library that my office is the only

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They did not get it. That is terrible. It is
                a very lengthy report — I have it here in my hand. It is the
                ‘Economic and Social Research Council End of Award Report’
                and gives a background to the whole history of the situation. It
                is made up of various papers, one of which has as part of its
                title &quot;See no evil, hear no evil&quot;, which seems to be
                the attitude of the Secretary of State, the First Minister and
                the Deputy First Minister. Another paper deals with ‘The
                &quot;Deserving&quot; Victims of Political Violence:
                &quot;Punishment&quot; Attacks in Northern Ireland’. A third
                is entitled ‘Joined-Up Government: A Multi-Agency Response to
                Violence in Northern Ireland.’ It is a very interesting
                document.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, those who want to keep together
                the charade of the Government that we have do not want to read
                the material that is contained here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another paper is to do with ‘An acceptable
                Level of Violence’, and that is the argument we are being
                asked to listen to.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last night I was speaking to a pressman from
                the BBC — that wonderful institution that we all have to
                tolerate with Christian love and gratitude for the crumbs that
                fall from the rich man’s table, although we all have to pay
                licence fees to keep those employed there in a good job — and
                he was saying that there is not as much violence as there used
                to be.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tell that to the young man who was crucified.
                Tell that to the parents who are mourning what has happened to
                their family. The invaluable documents, ‘ &quot;An Acceptable
                Level of Violence&quot; — Community Responses to Crime in
                Northern Ireland and South Africa’ and ‘The Return of
                &quot;Captain Moonlight&quot; — Informal Justice in Northern
                Ireland’, should have been made available by the Library or
                put in Members’ pigeonholes. A good deal of research has been
                carried out, but this information has not been considered by
                Members, through no fault of their own, because it was not made
                available to them.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree, but I would go further. I am sure my
                hon Friend will agree that those who support this Government are
                those who got the mad men out of the jails and released them
                into the community. These people, who are experts in, and
                godfathers of, this type of crime, are behind these attacks
                which are being carried out across the Province. I welcome this
                report, which gives us vital, detailed information. No Member
                will be able to refute this report because they have not been
                able to read it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Prof Knox did not pull any punches. He had a
                task to carry out, and he did not tailor the information in any
                way. He said it like it is, and this House would do well to
                listen to him. A misguided political agenda has brought this
                situation about. I would, in fact, go further and describe the
                political agenda as one which is criminal-supporting. This
                report exposes the failures of the Belfast Agreement. But, of
                course, if one dares to expose the failures, there will be just
                one line on the tongue of the Gentleman opposite and on the
                tongues of the Gentlemen here: &quot;You are against
                peace&quot;. What an atrocious lie. To make this claim is to
                tell the mother who objects to her 14-year-old child being
                beaten up and tormented in her home that she is &quot;against
                peace&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I suggest that every Member go to the Library
                and read the tragic poem contained in the last page of this
                report:</p>

                For anti-social behaviour — what can they mean?<br>
                Sure my brother he is just a child, he’s only turned fourteen.<br>
                Don’t cry my son; do not fear your broken bones will mend<br>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is a cry from the heart to which the

                moved that police and those who support the policing
                arrangements in Northern Ireland are being held responsible.
                That is the sad and sorry situation we find ourselves in today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In their Economic and Social Research Council
                Violence Research Project, Knox and Monaghan expose the folly

                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;for the British Government it is easier
                to ‘see no evil, hear no evil’ in relation to this

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report states that the parties who
                negotiated the Belfast Agreement all signed up to the Mitchell

                report of 1996 stated</p>

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And then what do they do? They turn a blind
                eye to them. A senior officer of the British Army told me the
                other day that each night the Army makes a log of such events
                but is told that they will not be published in any press. The
                figures are logged officially, but without publication. So what
                the Army has found out about beatings is never reported. We read
                reports from the RUC, but we never see the Army reports.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These beatings contribute to the fear that
                those who have used violence to pursue political objectives in
                the past will do it again in the future. Such attacks have no
                place in any lawful society, and to ask the people of Northern
                Ireland to agree to an &quot;acceptable level of violence&quot;
                is an insult to people living in this part of the United
                Kingdom. No level of violence is acceptable. It must cease
                forthwith.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This research paper also reveals why the
                Government have failed to deal effectively with these attacks.
                The Government do not want to listen to anyone who criticises
                and rightly condemns what is happening. As a result, when a
                politician does criticise he is told &quot;You are just playing
                politics and that is the party line.&quot; When academics take
                time to research and collate the relevant statistics, they too
                are criticised. The Deputy First Minister and the First Minister
                himself made an effort to play this report down.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In his report, Prof Knox criticised the
                former Secretary of State on a vital point. She maintained that
                the status of the ceasefires was a judgement she alone had to
                make — even though the criminals broke the ceasefires and used
                guns. By way of excuse, I heard one of the Ministers say
                &quot;Well, we have not had any breach of the ceasefire because
                the ceasefire is not to do with stabbing — it has to do with
                shooting.&quot; These criminals have been using their revolvers
                and their guns now for some time, but that has made no
                difference. The Secretary of State is not the person to say
                whether a ceasefire has been broken — the general public
                witnesses it and can see that it has.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Secretary of State is the sole arbiter on
                breaches of ceasefires, which means that Loyalists and
                Republicans can take the actions they do because they know that
                neither they nor their patronage will come to any harm
                politically.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whom did the Prime Minister meet when he was
                over here last week? He did not meet any of the parties opposed
                to the agreement, but he did hold talks at Hillsborough. Whom
                did he talk to? He talked to representatives of the people who
                are carrying out the genocide on the Shankill Road and other
                areas. The First Minister saw to it that the leader of the
                Ulster Democratic Party — I think that is what they call
                themselves — was in the Forum. So the patronage goes on, and
                the killings will go on until oxygen is taken away from the
                terrorists and they can no longer continue with their
                activities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My hon Friend Mr McCartney made the point
                that conceding that paramilitaries can control and brutalise
                their own communities with a political end in mind is a de facto
                acceptance by the Government that there is an acceptable level
                of violence and that these people can take the law into their
                own hands.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This research is an indictment of the Belfast
                Agreement. Today we are bringing to the bar of accountability
                the people who are responsible and those who have given them
                incentives. The blame rests not only on the First Minister and
                the Deputy First Minister and their supporters but also on their
                masters and the Secretary of State. They cannot, Pilate-like,
                wash their hands of this matter. It will not be going away.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What are the facts? The facts are very
                serious indeed, but, rather than go over the statistics, I want
                to concentrate on the increased activity. In the past nine days
                alone four 15-year-old schoolboys have been attacked by
                self-appointed punishment squads, both Republican and Loyalist.
                Over the same period four more teenagers have either been shot
                or beaten by squads intent on tightening their grip on their
                turf, just prior to what is envisaged as yet another critical
                moment for the future of the peace process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">RUC figures for January 2000 show a total of
                12 paramilitary punishment beatings and one shooting compared
                with seven shootings and seven assaults by the middle of last
                week — and we are not even at the end of January. In 2000, 86
                punishment shootings were carried out by Loyalists and 50 by
                Republicans. During the same 12-month period punishment beatings
                by Loyalists totalled 72, and those by Republicans 54. A small
                number of instances involved the new crucifixion shooting, where
                a victim is shot through both hands and both feet. This type of
                shooting makes it difficult for a victim to return to normal
                life as he could have done with the traditional kneecapping
                punishment. This is the situation we face. This is the situation
                that the Assembly needs to deal with this afternoon, and there
                can be no red herrings about policing, because it has nothing to
                do with policing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is to do with those who direct the
                forces of the law. If they receive reports about what is
                happening and who is responsible and close their eye to those
                reports, they are involving the forces of the Crown in wasting
                public money on investigating crime. When the Secretary of State
                and public representatives are presented with the crime, they
                close their eyes. There are also people so intent on boasting up
                the charade that is the so-called peace process that they are
                prepared to excuse punishment beatings. They say nothing about
                them, and when the issue is debated they remain silent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Belfast Agreement states that the report
                and the proposed reform of the RUC will solve nothing in the
                short term. Let us face up to it. It is not a matter of whether
                or not you get Patten. We have a Government who will not put
                down political violence. They want to get the Unionist majority,
                who are opposed now to the agreement and are rock solid in their
                opposition to it, to lower the flag and compromise. Mr Ken
                Maginnis, the spokesperson for the Official Unionist Party, made
                more concessions. We were told that they never made any
                concessions, but now he says &quot;We can make no more
                concessions.&quot; There will be no withdrawal of resistance by
                the majority of the Unionist people, for they know that if they
                have this in the green, what will they have in the dry? If this
                so-called peace process continues, and continues to achieve its
                aims, we will be plunged into far greater violence. The IRA will
                come out for the last great shove to push us, in this
                bicentennial year, out of the Union all together.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore this is a life and death situation.
                Those who want to colour the situation politically are wrong. We
                must face up to the fact that this is happening to our people on
                both sides of the religious divide. Either we have to be their
                custodians or guardians, or we should shut up. And I am not
                prepared to shut up on the issue. It must be exposed. Something
                has to be done.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I regret that I have gone over the 15 minutes
                that I tried to keep to. However, I had some preliminary things
                to say and I have said them, and I tried to say them as quickly
                as possible so that all who want can take part in the debate.
                Again, not for myself, for you told me, Mr Deputy Speaker, that
                I could speak for the whole two hours — not that I would think
                of doing such a dreadful thing. If I were a Back-Bencher,
                however, I would resent being only permitted five minutes to
                discuss matters that have not only disgusted my constituency but
                have led to the removal of people from their homes.</p>

                To date, the response of both the Government and the community
                to crime and the damage done to our communities by antisocial
                elements has been totally inadequate. Punishment beatings do not
                make communities any safer. They are a response to a lack of
                effective action from an accountable and acceptable policing
                service. They are a response to a policing deficit. The
                University of Ulster’s Economic and Social Research Council
                report highlights the strong support that there is for
                alternatives in the absence of a legitimate policing service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rising levels of antisocial behaviour in our
                communities are having a devastating effect. That is fact. In
                Nationalist and Republican areas the RUC is not dealing with
                this problem. That is fact. The formal criminal justice system
                has failed. That is fact. No one can condone punishment
                beatings. They do not make our community safer. The RUC itself
                has been engaged in attacks on our communities, and it is also
                responsible for punishment beatings. As recently as last week
                five people, including a Sinn Féin councillor, were badly
                assaulted in West Tyrone. Two weeks ago, my party Colleague
                Gerry Kelly was awarded substantial damages because a police
                officer assaulted him. Time and time again, members of the RUC
                have been found not to be amenable to the law. That was apparent
                in the recent case of Davy Adams, who was severely beaten by the
                RUC and awarded substantial damages. No legal action was taken
                against those in the RUC who were responsible. This is only the
                tip of the iceberg.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a culture of impunity in the RUC.
                That is another reason why accountability is imperative. The
                link between RUC inactivity and antisocial behaviour in
                Nationalist communities is well known, if not widely reported.
                Nationalists are all too aware that the RUC is prepared to allow
                criminals to operate freely in exchange for their acting as
                informants.</p>

                Surely this debate and amendment have been moved on the issue of
                punishment beatings. I have never seen any evidence to suggest
                that any of these so-called punishment beatings were carried out
                by RUC members.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The RUC, with all its surveillance,
                intelligence-gathering equipment, guns and plastic bullets, has
                had every opportunity to demonstrate that it is able to tackle,
                and is committed to tackling, crime in Nationalist areas. It has
                failed to do this. Known criminals are apprehended by the RUC
                and frequently released without charge. That was the case with
                those involved in a series of pharmacy robberies in West
                Belfast. Indeed, antisocial criminals are returned —</p>

                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Gildernew:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No. Indeed, antisocial criminals are returned
                to cause havoc and pain in Nationalist areas when they are
                released into our communities. That is due to lenient
                sentencing, suspended sentences, and the fact that the RUC has
                intervened on their behalf in exchange for their agreement to
                work as RUC informers. The RUC agenda in Nationalist communities
                is all too clear. It wishes to create a network of informers and
                cause destabilisation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What can we do to end punishment beatings? We
                need to create a new police service that is democratically
                accountable and acceptable to the local community. That is not
                the RUC. The RUC is not accountable, or acceptable, to
                Nationalists and Republicans. The RUC is not tackling the
                spiralling levels of antisocial crime, drug dealing and
                so-called joyriding. The RUC is encouraging this increase in
                antisocial crime by its attitude and response to Nationalist and
                Republican communities. The creation of an accountable policing
                service, with the support of all communities, is being
                obstructed. Supporters of progress should recognise that
                everyone wants to achieve that goal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not merely Republicans, Sinn Féin, the
                SDLP, the Irish Government and the Catholic Church that need to
                see progress on this issue. Everyone has a stake in the creation
                of a new policing service. If we are to stamp out antisocial
                behaviour, and the responses to it, which do little to improve
                community safety, then the creation of an accountable and
                acceptable policing service is necessary. Unfortunately, the
                Mandelson policing Act has gutted the Patten Report. There is a
                real need for this deficit to be addressed otherwise we will
                again be left with a policing deficit.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to pay tribute to those in the
                community who are working to tackle crime through non-violent
                means. These people recognise that the RUC and the formal
                justice system have failed our communities. Restorative justice
                projects, such as Community Restorative Justice (CRJ) and
                others, have demonstrated a real commitment to tackling these
                problems. Many people are freely giving their time and energy to
                make their communities safer. They are working to create new
                alternatives to punishment beatings, the failed formal criminal
                justice system and the RUC. Sinn Féin totally supports CRJ. We
                need to see a greater commitment from Government to increase
                resources for these initiatives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask Members to support the Sinn Féin
                amendment calling on the Government to address this issue
                through the creation of an accountable policing service that has
                the support of all communities. Go raibh maith agat.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. Punishment beatings are
                one of the greatest abuses of human rights in Northern Ireland
                today. The reality of this barbaric activity can be seen in this
                week’s ‘Sunday Times’. The Provisional IRA is reported to
                have shot a 17-year-old boy for breaking windows. That is the
                reality of what is happening in our society. I consider the Sinn
                Féin amendment to be simply a way of continuing to play with
                words. Unionists want to see actual deeds, not fancy words. I
                will be opposing the amendment, given its source and objective.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also aware of brutal attacks in my own
                constituency by Loyalists. There is a problem in both
                communities. Some of these attacks involve baseball bats studded
                with nails. It is unbelievable what has been happening. These
                are irreversible human tragedies, leaving many young victims
                scarred and disabled for life. There is also a huge and
                unnecessary financial burden on the Health Service. It has
                enough broken bones on its waiting lists without creating
                others. The Health Minister, Bairbre de Brún, has refused to
                provide me with figures on punishment beatings that have been
                treated by the Health Service, or even to report the number of
                admissions. There is a huge financial cost, as well as the
                personal tragedies involved, and that should be reported.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the fact that the RUC is now
                providing accurate figures on punishment beatings that have been
                formally reported to the police. The figures are available on
                the RUC’s web site and can be stood over. It is a shame that
                in the past this information had to be collated by volunteers
                and charities. I accept that many people suffering attacks will
                still not appear on these lists. Some people still do not go to
                the police, fearing further punishment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are worrying trends. In particular I
                look at the figures starting in 1995, when there were three
                shootings involved in paramilitary attacks. This has now risen
                to 115 — 75 by Loyalist groups and 40 by Republican groups.
                That is not acceptable in any society. At the same time there
                are still large numbers of brutal paramilitary- style physical
                attacks and beatings — up until November, 62 by Loyalists and
                44 by Republican groups.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What would we be saying if this were
                happening in some Third-World state or banana republic? This is
                happening in Northern Ireland today, which is in the Western
                World and claims to be a Christian, civilised society. It is
                continuing, and will continue, until Nationalist and some
                Loyalist groups show leadership in their own communities. When
                are they going to accept that they too have a responsibility for
                this outrageous behaviour, as long as they hold back full
                support for the police? Silence is sometimes encouraging
                punishment attacks.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Restorative justice has been advocated
                earlier. It is criticised in this report as often being
                synonymous with the punishment attacks themselves. Indeed, there
                has been specific press criticism of the fact that in some areas
                the former judge of the kangaroo court is now the chief mentor
                in restorative justice. What people are being offered is
                &quot;Agree with some community service or we will blow your
                knees off.&quot; That is not real restorative justice. There is
                a clear correlation between political events and punishment
                beatings in Northern Ireland — the Knox Report shows this.
                Restorative justice must be clearly linked to the rule of law if
                it is to be done properly. It must be linked to the proper
                criminal justice system. It is not a way to legitimise kangaroo
                courts or informal administration of justice. The criminal
                justice system itself must be seen to be effective in dealing
                with petty crime and antisocial behaviour.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the context of human rights, punishment
                beatings breach the right to life, the prohibition on torture,
                the right to liberty and security and the right to a fair trial
                — &quot;no punishment beating without trial&quot;. Punishment
                beatings constitute the most significant breach of human rights
                in Northern Ireland today.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr A Maginness:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Punishment shootings and beatings are a huge
                problem for our society. According to calculations, 2,303 people
                have been shot in punishment attacks since 1973, and 1,626
                people have been beaten in such attacks since 1982. These quotes
                are an underestimation of the actual figures rather than an
                accurate record of the number of these attacks — we do have a
                huge problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Ian Paisley has blamed the Good Friday
                Agreement for punishment attacks, while Ms Gildernew has blamed
                the RUC. However, in truth, we have an unstable society, in
                which paramilitaries have grown up and in which they have chosen
                to exercise political control and to carry out so-called
                policing of their areas through the medium of punishment
                attacks. All right-thinking people in the Chamber must condemn
                this. I am disappointed that some Members who have spoken did
                not forthrightly condemned these attacks.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Good Friday Agreement gives us an
                opportunity to put an end to these attacks once and for all. It
                does so by providing the right political context in which to
                provide political stability and a system of government in which
                there is respect for both political traditions. Within that
                stable system, we can attack the very roots of paramilitarism,
                which have cursed and bedevilled our society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have tried, in the context of the Good
                Friday Agreement, to create a human rights culture, and we will
                continue to do so. As Mr Beggs said, these attacks offend the
                European Convention on Human Rights because they contravene the
                right to life, the prohibition on torture, the right to liberty
                and security and the right to a fair trial.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The prohibition on torture is not being
                adhered to, in any way, by paramilitary organisations which
                continue, through their actions, to torture and degrade ordinary
                citizens in our society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This report usefully highlights the whole
                issue of punishment beatings and shootings. It also criticises
                the statutory agencies, including the Housing Executive, the
                Social Security Agency and the Compensation Agency. Those
                criticisms remain unfounded, but I am certain that the Northern
                Ireland Executive are prepared to investigate them in a serious
                and considerate fashion and to respond to them in a fair and
                just manner.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore we cannot support the latter part
                of Dr Paisley’s motion. While supporting the first part of it,
                which condemns paramilitary violence and punishment beatings and
                shootings, we cannot support the implicit criticism of the
                Northern Ireland Administration, which has not yet responded to
                the very criticisms highlighted in this report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am certain that the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister, the Administration and those Ministers
                who have responsibility for those institutions — such as the
                Minister for Social Development, who is in charge of the Housing
                Executive and the Social Security Agency — will attempt to
                respond to those criticisms.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My party supports the amendment. Of course, a
                system of policing which is acceptable and accountable to both
                communities will serve effectively to diminish the level of
                punishment attacks in our community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, it cannot do that by itself. We need
                a collective commitment by everyone in our society to respect
                one another’s political cultures and, in particular, civil and
                human rights. We will be unable to deal with this problem if we
                do not respect those rights. Therefore, while we support the
                amendment, we do not regard it as being completely able to
                tackle the problem of punishment attacks.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Boyd:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regrettably, shootings and beatings by
                paramilitary organisations are a daily occurrence, particularly
                since the signing of the Belfast Agreement. They are carried out
                primarily by pro-agreement paramilitaries. On 14 May 1998 the
                Prime Minister said that the ceasefires were indeed complete and
                unequivocal and that there would be the dismantling of
                paramilitary structures actively directing and promoting
                violence. On 19 November 1999 the Belfast High Court ruled that
                murders carried out by the Provisional IRA in its own community
                did not break its ceasefire, thereby providing a green light for
                ongoing paramilitary activity. As stated in the Economic and
                Social Research Council report produced by Prof Colin Knox and
                Dr Rachel Monaghan,</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Mitchell principles of ‘democracy
                and non-violence’, to which all constitutional political
                parties subscribe, have been compromised in the interests of
                moving forward politically.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paramilitaries have some sort of warped
                logic, which is, sadly, endorsed by the Government, which says
                that there is a difference between so-called military operations
                and the other barbarities that they exact on their communities.
                It is a terrible indictment on the Government that they are
                described as having a &quot;See no evil, hear no evil&quot;
                attitude to paramilitary violence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The breakdown in law and order is a direct
                result of the Belfast Agreement and its appeasement of
                terrorism. Paramilitary organisations have been strengthened by
                the release of their leading activists, funding of £6 million
                provided by the European Union and the UK Government and the
                elevation of their inextricably linked parties into the centre
                of the political process. Plush new community offices have been
                provided for ex-prisoners, giving a centre for paramilitaries in
                the heart of some working-class areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today, paramilitary organisations are
                structurally and financially stronger than ever. Armed and
                masked robberies, racketeering and extortion are a daily
                occurrence. Building contractors, retail shops and businesses,
                particularly in working-class areas, are literally being held to
                ransom. There have been 14 armed robberies in the last four
                weeks in Newtownabbey alone. The latest was at an off-licence in
                Glengormley last night. Armed robberies have more than doubled
                in Newtownabbey in the past two years and have increased
                considerably throughout Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ulster Unionist Party leader, David
                Trimble, said in his 1998 election manifesto that paramilitary
                organisations must dismantle, disarm and stop the beatings, and
                that the Ulster Unionist Party would hold Mr Blair to his
                promises and would not sit in the Government of Northern Ireland
                with unreconstructed terrorists. Other parties gave similar
                commitments, yet we see the election of persons belonging to
                parties inextricably linked to paramilitary organisations to
                civic offices in Fermanagh, Belfast, Londonderry, Newtownabbey
                and elsewhere, with the assistance of votes from other political
                parties. We need more than just words of condemnation from all
                democrats.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report states that paramilitaries set
                themselves up as the police for their own areas. The ongoing
                demands from Nationalists for the disbandment of the RUC and the
                scaling down of policing resources by a weak Government have
                resulted in the strengthening of the paramilitaries’ grip in
                many communities and the rule of law being compromised. The
                report says</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Those individuals ‘punished’ by
                paramilitaries are denied ‘due process’ and the beatings and
                the shootings meted out are becoming more vicious and
                prolonged.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The statistics provided in the report are
                shocking. On average, there have been 85 so-called punishment
                shootings and 90 beatings per year since 1973. However, these
                figures are underestimated by 50%, because many attacks are
                unreported due to victims’ fears. The report also says that
                there is no information available on charges brought against the
                perpetrators. However, detection rates are described as
                &quot;relatively low&quot;. The figures show a significant
                increase in beatings and an increasing trend in the numbers of
                exiles since the so-called ceasefires of 1994. Exiling is a
                method paramilitaries use to exact their form of justice without
                the same outcry from the community that beatings and shootings
                cause.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most beatings happen to young males who are
                in their twenties. Twenty-five per cent of those attacked are
                under 20 years old. Kids as young as 13 and 14 have been
                attacked.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One victim named in the report is Ian Price.
                He was a 13-year-old boy who was singled out from a group of
                friends by masked men, flung to the ground and beaten with
                baseball bats studded with nails. He suffered a shattered elbow,
                broken fingers, deep puncture wounds to his legs, cuts and
                multiple bruising. After the attack, a gun was put to his head
                and he was ordered out of the country. He was a 13-year-old boy.
                Yet, we have those parties that are inextricably linked to
                paramilitary organisations referring to the rights of children
                and calling for the appointment of a commissioner for children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">IRA/Sinn Féin have consistently refused to
                call on the community to assist the police in apprehending those
                responsible for horrific crimes, even those against their own
                people — for example, the recent deaths on the Antrim Road,
                Belfast, of a mother and daughter due to youths in a stolen car.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr B Hutchinson:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It ceases to amaze me that some people who
                have read this report seem to have selective amnesia. They
                select pieces of the report — not all of it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to end punishment beatings and
                shootings and we need to find a way forward. Unfortunately,
                Members have not used this opportunity to discuss how we could
                do that. We do not have time to wait for a new policing service.
                It needs to happen now.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a number of Members have said, we are
                brutalising our society and our young people. However, this
                issue needs a society and a community response. There are people
                who are carrying out so-called antisocial behaviour, but there
                are also people in the community who are reporting others for
                such behaviour and asking for something to be done. We need to
                change attitudes, and we need to change how we deal with this
                issue. I would like us to focus on some of the ways forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members have said that the solution
                needs to be connected to the justice system. Of course it does.
                However, there are already programmes in place that are
                supported by the police and statutory agencies and which are not
                about beating young people or anyone else.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is about trying to find a way forward
                and about changing attitudes. Attitudes will not be changed
                overnight — it takes years. All of us will have to suffer what
                happens until we do change those attitudes. People should not
                lift a gun or beat others with a baseball bat. We need to find
                other ways forward. We can all make excuses for why punishment
                beatings happen, or do not happen, but the only way that we are
                going to prevent them is by coming up with alternatives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards the report’s accuracy, I have
                heard Members in the past supporting Vincent McKenna — a
                bastion of veracity, as we all know — who we found out had
                fabricated statistics and told us all that people were doing
                things when they were not. We need to be careful about how these
                reports are compiled.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have all seen statistics and we know that
                there are</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;lies, damned lies and statistics.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to be careful. It does not matter
                whether one person or 101 people have been punished in the last
                27 years. The point is that it happened. We need to be asking
                &quot;How do we move into the future? How do we find ways
                forward?&quot; Those are the questions we need to ask. That is
                what this is about.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This House is in place to bring change to
                Northern Ireland. We all want democracy to work whether we are
                anti-agreement or pro-agreement, and if this House can provide a
                lead, that is what we must do. I do not make excuses about the
                RUC. In November 1994 I said that people who have information
                about those who carried out antisocial behaviour should report
                it to the RUC. I repeat that today, but we need to ask whether
                the people in our communities or in society generally want
                justice or revenge. That is another important question. We need
                to respond positively and with no violence as regards antisocial
                behaviour in our communities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How many Members have constituency offices in
                which we hear people pleading with us about the behaviour of
                some people outside their homes? We all report such things to
                the police and they say that they can do nothing, as those
                people are not breaking the law. That is the problem. Is this
                about justice or is it about revenge? Those issues need to be
                tackled, but that will not be done in four minutes, five minutes
                or two hours in the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate Dr Ian Paisley for tabling the
                motion. However, Members need to have a proper debate about
                punishment beatings. It must be decided whether we make the
                issue a Committee’s responsibility or form an Ad Hoc Committee
                to look at the findings of the research project and examine
                other matters. Members must be positive. Let us bring forward a
                report that will tell us how to get out of this mess.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to put the research project into
                the context of the 20 other research projects that were carried
                out simultaneously by the Economic and Social Research Council.
                It initiated large-scale funding throughout the United Kingdom
                for a variety of projects. The project titles were
                &quot;Violence&quot; and &quot;Research on Violence&quot;. All
                the research projects concluded that predatory violence is less
                extensive than violence from people known to the victim.
                Unfortunately, the research project does not state whether the
                victims knew the perpetrators.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the research project does document
                the levels of punishment beatings. That had not been done to
                date, and it is extremely important. I agree with that part of
                the report, and it is hoped that from now on accident and
                emergency departments and the Housing Executive will keep a
                rigorous database — unlike that kept by Vincent McKenna and
                others in the past. That is a very helpful recommendation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The research project has not fulfilled its
                terms of reference regarding the assessment of possible
                strategies for prevention and reduction. It is not sufficient
                for a research project to describe what organisations have not
                done and to suggest that there has been a level of indifference
                and minimisation. If we are to take this forward we need to flag
                up a number of things that have happened. That is why,
                reluctantly, I cannot support the motion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not support the amendment. Sinn Féin
                Members should know from the research carried out in South
                Africa by Rachel Monaghan, the co-author of the report with
                Colin Knox, that reforming the police there did not stop
                punishment beatings or antisocial behaviour. Therefore, to
                support the amendment or the motion is insufficient.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The research project is overly critical of a
                number of organisations that have tried against the odds to put
                alternative strategies in place. The Probation Board for
                Northern Ireland has a range of programmes in place to tackle
                youths offending. Its &quot;Youth at Risk&quot; project in west
                Belfast, the Short Strand and east Belfast, extended now to
                north Belfast and Omagh, is working, and Members ought to be
                supporting that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The research project states that the issue
                can only be tackled when community groups sit down in
                partnership and adopt an inter-agency, integrated approach.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members may think that south Belfast is
                an affluent area, but it is worth noting that yesterday, for the
                third time in less than three months, my constituency office was
                robbed. Before Christmas the office was broken into by a heroin
                addict; yesterday people coming off the street in broad daylight
                robbed it. I and others were in the office. Crime among young
                people is certainly increasing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The response of my constituency office on
                these occasions has been to contact the police, and that is the
                only way forward when dealing with crime. The individual who
                broke into the office before Christmas was eventually
                apprehended and brought before the courts. We must continue to
                make that the process of decent law and order and to follow the
                systems of justice that exist.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is not to say that other bodies should
                not be given more legal powers. The Housing Executive is now
                looking at what to do about antisocial behaviour. I do not
                propose that anyone should deal with antisocial behaviour
                through punishment beatings. I will attempt to take a
                multi-agency approach, with education and welfare officers,
                officials from the Housing Executive, probation officers and
                juvenile liaison officers around the table to establish whether
                it is young people or particular families in communities who are
                offending.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Housing Executive has also established a
                specialist antisocial behaviour unit. A police officer has been
                seconded to the Housing Executive, and, in turn, the Housing
                Executive has seconded one of its workers to Mediation Network.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is mediation that we need. In the end, I
                believe we must have the increased powers that we seek in both
                civil and criminal law, as well as the inter-agency community
                responses to young people who offend. That is the only way
                forward.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is an indictment of the procedures of this
                House that, on a subject matter of this gravity, Members wishing
                to speak are only afforded five minutes to do so. I also find it
                amazing that Sinn Féin should ascribe the cause of the
                brutalities and obscenities in the beatings, shootings and
                stabbings that are going on to the RUC. What is even more
                amazing is that the representative of the SDLP should suggest
                that it is really all down to the Housing Executive and the
                social security agencies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The PUP suggests that this is a matter of
                fraudulent statistics by making references to Vincent McKenna.
                The statistics quoted in the House today, however, were those of
                the Royal Ulster Constabulary. If anything, those statistics are
                an understatement of the true position. Everyone knows that a
                very significant proportion of those who are subjected to
                beatings and intimidation do not report the matter to the
                authorities, which essentially makes these statistics an
                understatement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me return to the political basis for
                these beatings. Beatings, stabbings, intimidations and shootings
                are a method by which paramilitary organisations, inextricably
                linked with some of the parties in this House, exercise
                political control over substantial areas of Northern Ireland.
                And why are they permitted to do so? They are permitted to do so
                in the case of Republicanism because Republicans have the
                political will and the capacity to bomb the mainland. The
                British Government’s strategic political objective is to keep
                bombs off the mainland, to halt attacks on economic targets and
                to ensure the safety of the first-class citizens on the British
                mainland. To maintain a degree of balance between the
                Republicans, who can deliver this threat, they have to also
                placate the Loyalist paramilitaries. If the Loyalist
                paramilitaries were to come off the alleged ceasefire and
                provoke the Republicans into a response, the whole business
                would collapse like a pack of cards, and the strategic objective
                of the British Government would be frustrated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This report highlights two essential
                features. The first feature is that the principles of democracy
                in the rule of law, as set out by Mitchell, have been
                compromised, allegedly for political progress. Secondly, the
                British Government have adopted a &quot;Hear no evil, see no
                evil&quot; policy towards the violence of the &quot;good
                terrorists&quot; that are said to be within the peace process.
                In fact, there is no difference between the &quot;good
                terrorists&quot; and the dissident terrorists who have been
                active recently. There are only terrorists. The &quot;good
                terrorists&quot; may, in the short term, not be committing these
                depredations because they feel that the political system has to
                deliver their objectives merely by the threat of terror. But
                they also benefit from the terror of the so-called dissidents.
                Anyone who suggests that the present activity of the so-called
                dissidents is to wreck the peace process is living in another
                world.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The purpose of those dissidents is to say to
                the British Government &quot;This is a taste of what the ‘good
                terrorists’ can give you if they come off ceasefire.&quot;
                That is why the British Government, with regard to the
                definition of the ceasefire, do not count the murder of Andrew
                Kearney, the murder of Charles Bennett or the massive
                intimidation and beatings that go on. It is also why they
                continue to say in the round &quot;These are not breaches of the
                ceasefire.&quot;</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chief Constable has talked about the
                distorted values of those &quot;good terrorists&quot; who
                describe these beatings as not being a breach of their ceasefire
                commitments — ceasing military operations. It seems that the
                British Government prefer the distorted view of terrorists to
                the opinion of the Chief Constable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">More and more people will be affected by the
                rise in crime. More and more people will be like the denizens of
                the ghettos — outside the peace process — and more people
                are beginning to question what the peace process is. It is a
                licence for terror as long as it serves British policy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Courtney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Punishment by self-appointed persons has been
                part of our community for many years. In the past we had
                kneecapping, which often resulted in severe injuries to
                individuals and, in many instances, loss of limbs. That was only
                one of the barbaric practices carried out by so-called
                punishment squads. This was condoned for years by certain
                political parties but never condemned. The ultimate punishment
                is death itself. Often it meant a bullet in the head, the person
                blindfolded and left on a remote country road. In more recent
                times we have had punishment beatings using baseball bats,
                sticks and even sledgehammers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report on informal criminal justice
                systems carried out by the Violence Research Project found that
                such systems had different motivations in Loyalist and
                Republican areas. In Republican areas, the prime targets for
                punishment are young people involved in antisocial behaviour
                such as car theft, joyriding and housebreaking. In Loyalist
                areas, punishment attacks are used to maintain internal
                discipline and police their own areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">According to police statistics, between 1973
                and June 2000 there have been 2,303 paramilitary shootings —
                approximately 85 per year — of which 43% were carried out by
                Loyalists and 57% by Republicans. Since 1982 there have been
                1,626 beatings. That is an average of 90 per year — 46%
                Loyalist and 54% Republican. Those are the official statistics.
                The actual numbers are higher, as young people are reluctant to
                report them for fear of reprisals. Approximately 25% of those
                attacked are under 20 years of age, some as young as 13 or 14.
                Last week ‘The Sunday Times’ reported an incident in Belfast
                in which a 17-year-old was shot in both feet for throwing stones
                at the house of a man who he believed had shot his cousin.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are all aware that, in the main, the young
                people who are attacked come from socially deprived areas where
                the community is controlled by fear. Something must be done to
                protect these young people and bring the perpetrators to
                justice. There are two main restorative justice projects
                operating in Northern Ireland — Greater Shankill Alternatives
                and Community Restorative Justice (CRJ). Both offer a
                non-violent alternative to punishment attacks but need further
                safeguards involving all the statutory agencies before they can
                be given the support of the whole community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with my Colleague Alban Maginness
                that the Good Friday Agreement is the only means of getting rid
                of these so-called paramilitary attacks. It is up to us to
                ensure that we do nothing to disrupt that process.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr S Wilson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to deal mostly with the amendment put
                forward by Sinn Féin. One should not be surprised that those
                who, in this House and elsewhere, call for commissioners for
                children should defend those who mutilate children. Those who,
                in their ministerial positions, seek to exclude and expel
                bullies from school let the bullies loose on the street of
                Nationalist areas on a nightly basis and then come into this
                House and try to defend what goes on in their name.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us have no doubt about it. What goes on
                in Nationalist areas goes on in the name of IRA/Sinn Féin. It
                is carried out by members of IRA/Sinn Féin and then supported
                in this House by members of IRA/Sinn Féin. What is even more
                despicable is that there is so little moral courage in the SDLP
                that it cannot distance itself from the stance of Sinn Féin.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us look at some of the arguments put
                forward today. We are told that punishment beatings take place
                because there is unaccountable policing. What do you put in
                place of that? You put into place unaccountable punishment
                beatings. You have people who set themselves up — as we have
                heard — as judge, jury and executioner. You have people who
                are guilty of some of the acts that they punish others for and,
                indeed, who protect some within their ranks guilty of similar
                acts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last August ‘The Sunday Tribune’ all but
                named an IRA member found guilty of child abuse and who was
                allowed to stay in his community, protected by the IRA, because
                he was related to a former IRA chief of staff in west Belfast.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Monaghan and Newry, IRA members were found
                guilty of child abuse and rape but were they put out of their
                community? Were they expelled by those who want to police their
                community? No. Why? It is because of their connections. We are
                being lectured today about unaccountable policing, yet we are
                being told that this is policing, and that the actions being
                taken are in response to community demands.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fact is that these actions are being
                carried out to show — and to enforce — the terrorists’
                will in their communities. Mrs Courtney referred to the boy who
                was shot for breaking the windows of the IRA member he believed
                had shot his uncle. Oddly enough — despite this great talk
                about restorative justice — the boy’s mother said that the
                Sinn Féin representative of the local restorative justice
                campaign came around the night before and told the boy to report
                to him at 7 o’clock to have his hands broken. These are the
                people who believe in non-violent alternatives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us look at some of those who were
                formerly in the ranks of IRA/Sinn Féin and who would understand
                what it is all about. The verdict of one person was — and this
                was in the lower Ormeau — that Sinn Féin was now doing things
                which it would be squealing about had those things been done by
                the RUC.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is Sinn Féin’s aim? It is to set up a
                one-party police state in Nationalist areas. The RUC has warned
                that there will be an upsurge in such activity before the coming
                elections as IRA/Sinn Féin seeks to establish its print on its
                communities. This has nothing to do with justice.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the chance to debate this issue,
                and I support the motion. Dr Paisley said — <i>[Interruption] </i>Sorry,
                I rise to support the amendment. That was a bit of a Freudian
                slip perhaps.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Paisley said that the RUC issue is a red
                herring. I suggest, in all honesty, that you cannot divorce the
                absence of an accepted policing service from the issue of
                punishment beatings. Sinn Féin has consistently attempted, and
                will consistently attempt, to condemn punishment beatings in our
                community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As elected politicians, councillors or
                Assembly Members, we have attempted to put in place a mechanism
                to eradicate the dreadful image of punishment beatings. It is a
                difficult situation, and constituents knock on your door to ask
                what you will do about certain individuals who are making their
                lives hell on earth. For one reason or another, these people do
                not want to go to the RUC. Perhaps in Mr Billy Hutchinson’s
                community they do not want to go because they do not get an
                adequate response. Members of the Nationalist community suspect
                that the RUC allows this to happen to create informers or to
                help create a situation on the ground where people will say that
                they want it back into their areas and that they want the RUC to
                be unreconstructed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Databases and the various devices which were
                mentioned cannot cure what is a fundamentally political issue. I
                know of no Republican or Nationalist who wants young men, young
                women or anyone else to be subjected to a crucifixion shooting
                or a punishment beating. The fact is that this is what the local
                people demand, and it is difficult to know how to respond to
                that. The issue of the RUC is not a red herring; it is one which
                cannot be divorced from activities such as punishment beatings
                in Nationalist areas. We have heard from Mr Ervine and Mr Billy
                Hutchinson about what has happened in the lower Shankill and
                about the lack of response from the RUC during the dreadful
                situation that was allowed to develop in that area. It was, in
                fact, the efforts of the Loyalist paramilitaries, rather than
                any external agency, that brought an end to those attacks.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Punishment attacks and beatings are wrong;
                they have no place in any civilised society, and Sinn Féin has
                no problem in spelling that out. However, we do not yet live in
                a normal, civilised society that is policed in a normal way.
                There is an absence of fair and impartial policing. The
                Nationalist/Republican people do not have faith in, nor do they
                give allegiance to, what they consider to be a discredited RUC.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us not forget the ongoing punishment
                beatings being administered by the RUC, such as that which took
                place last week on two young schoolgirls at Greencastle, County
                Tyrone. Unfortunately, in the absence of fair and impartial
                policing for all, so-called punishment attacks will continue.
                That is neither a threat nor a promise, but a statement of fact
                and a recognition of the reality in Nationalist and Republican
                areas.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs E Bell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although I have only cursorily read the
                report, my comments will be as relevant as some of those that
                have been made in the Chamber today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alliance supports the motion because
                paramilitary attacks are one of the greatest scourges of our
                society and it is right and proper that the Assembly should
                declare its total revulsion towards them. The Assembly must call
                upon the Government to take more resolute action to stamp them
                out completely.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We do, however, have reservations about two
                aspects of the motion. First, I am appalled at the DUP’s use
                of the term &quot;punishment beatings&quot;. The use of the term
                &quot;punishment&quot; confers on the act a degree of legitimacy
                by suggesting that the guilt of a victim is an established fact.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The victims may be suspected of taking part
                in antisocial behaviour, but it is solely a suspicion —
                untried and unproven — on the parts of people who are not
                legally equipped to make those judgements. In many other
                instances, victims are singled out, simply for crossing the path
                of one of the local godfathers. The most infamous example of
                this is the attack on Andrew Kearney in Artillery Flats.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to make it clear: we should never
                grant legitimacy to such activities — never. The paramilitary
                groups involved act as judge, jury and executioner and show no
                regard for either the due processes of law or for basic,
                internationally accepted human rights standards. At the very
                least, the DUP should have referred to them as so-called
                punishment beatings or, better still, as what they really are
                — paramilitary attacks.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not just the DUP, however, who fall
                into that trap. The Government, the media and even some human
                rights groups repeatedly make the same error. The Government
                retain responsibility for criminal justice, and it is correct
                that we should call on them for more robust and resolute action
                against such activities. There have been few arrests, fewer
                prosecutions and virtually no convictions for these barbaric
                acts, which seem to get worse every day. There is a major
                problem with getting people to report what they know and to
                speak out in court, but there are other methods of getting
                evidence, such as forensic science. In pursuing the perpetrators
                of such barbarities, the Government must show no pragmatism or
                political expediency. Such activities are not directed primarily
                against the Good Friday Agreement, but the agreement will be
                greatly weakened if it is not used to strengthen the respect for
                the rule of law.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The attacks should be seen in the wider
                context of the growing problem of institutionalised
                paramilitarism. Some in our society like to paint a picture in
                which there are good paramilitaries, who are avuncular local
                figures, and bad paramilitaries, who are a burden on the backs
                of the people. All paramilitarism is wrong, and it is nothing
                short of subversion of the rule of law and democracy.
                Institutionalised paramilitarism contributes to a sense of
                ghettoisation and social exclusion, to say nothing of the denial
                of a wide range of opportunities and rights. A culture of
                communal separation allows the problem to grow and fester. It
                gives weight to the misguided notion that distinct communities
                in Northern Ireland can have autonomy at the expense of the
                police and the courts. With policing reform well under way, it
                is time for all parts of society to embrace a single,
                professional police service for the whole Province.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The RUC has come under scrutiny from a wide
                variety of ill-informed international bodies — and one or two
                local bodies — some of whom, undoubtedly, have an axe to
                grind. The degree of scrutiny is unparalleled anywhere in the
                world. The RUC has been castigated for methods that, on the
                whole, are more professional and more restrained than those to
                be seen daily in the Republic or in the USA. What do we hear
                from those bodies about the activity of paramilitaries? There is
                a deafening silence, with only the speeches and behaviour of
                Prof Brice Dickson and the Human Rights Commission as an
                honourable exception. Often, there is a suggestion — repeated,
                I am sorry to say, in the Sinn Féin amendment — that the
                cessation of such behaviour is conditional upon the creation of
                what such groups consider to be an accountable policing service.
                Silence can readily be taken as consent. It is time to stop
                viewing human rights as an issue relating solely to the duty of
                the state towards the individual citizen and to start
                considering it in the context of how we treat one another.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have often seen at first hand the effects
                on supposed criminals and their families of a visit from the
                local hoods. I saw it as a worker with the Peace People
                organisation in the 1970s and 1980s, when I worked with families
                who had been intimidated. More recently, I saw it as a member of
                the Probation Board for Northern Ireland. Prof McWilliams has
                described the problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is an indictment of our society that such
                things still occur today. I support the motion, but not the
                amendment.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Attwood:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have two comments to make on Mr John Kelly’s
                contribution. He said that the attacks would continue because
                there was no policing and because it was the wish of the
                community. Such comments have serious implications. It does not
                surprise me that John Kelly should say that it was the wish of
                the community. In the past, another organisation from the
                Republican tradition imposed its will upon the community on this
                island. I am not surprised that now, when a small,
                unrepresentative section of the community in parts of the North
                demands punishment attacks, Sinn Féin responds, using a
                spurious legitimacy to justify the fact that punishment attacks
                are carried out in our community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, it is the politics of denial and
                irresponsibility to say that because there is no policing, the
                worst form of policing should be imposed upon our community.
                That is a policing that denies human rights and denies the due
                process and rule of law. It imposes the worst forms of
                punishment upon people in very spurious and invalid
                circumstances. If the only basis on which Sinn Féin can come to
                the Chamber and explain away its attitude to punishment attacks
                is to say that they occur because of the wishes of a small
                section of people in Republican communities, and because there
                is no policing, then I do wonder how far Sinn Féin has moved on
                the issues of policing, criminal justice and how to properly
                conduct affairs at community level.</p>
                <b>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I find the Member’s comments entirely
                incongruous. The Member is supporting the implementation of the
                Patten report, which would permit the people who are currently
                carrying out these so-called punishment beatings into the
                police. That seems to be an entirely untenable position.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Attwood:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Member reads the Patten Report closely
                he will see that Patten sets out those who are entitled to
                become members of the future Police Service. There has been no
                objection raised by the Government on that matter in relation to
                its legislation. Following a close reading of the report, the
                Member will realise that what he has just said is inconsistent
                with both the Patten Report and the Police (Northern Ireland)
                Act 2000.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I now move to the Sinn Féin amendment, and
                attempt to position the issue of punishment attacks in the wider
                context of the current police debate. There are changing
                attitudes in society to the issue of policing, and it is
                important that these attitudes, which are beginning to emerge,
                be heard. We sense in the community that we represent, and
                beyond, that people want to begin to test the structures — not
                just the political structures that have been set up by the Good
                Friday Agreement, but the policing structures that could yet be
                set up. That is evident in the fact that many people are
                beginning to test the new independent police complaints
                mechanism.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our communities, which have been so resilient
                over many years in adverse circumstances, are beginning to
                strain, and core community values are being put under pressure.
                It is time to consolidate those communities, and one mechanism
                of doing that is to have an agreed and acceptable police
                service. Whatever differences there may be on many issues
                arising from the Good Friday Agreement, there is a sense that
                the agreement itself has to be consolidated. It is our last best
                strategy and our future best hope. Nothing should be done that
                idly or recklessly endangers what has been so painfully created.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is time for those in our communities who
                imposed their will through paramilitary punishment attacks, or
                who organised to impose their viewpoint on the wider structures
                of our community, to begin to roll back, so that individuals and
                the community are liberated and the common good is served.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We face a difficult time, and there are
                currently negotiations taking place in Downing Street. It is
                very important to understand that if we can get the policing
                issue right — and we might not get it right — our community
                is minded, willing and able to play its role in that new
                political and policing order. If we can get that right in the
                negotiations going on in Downing Street, then we can get our
                communities right, and we will see the purging of the tribalism
                of punishment attacks.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Gildernew:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
                Prior to winding up, I make the point that I find it incongruous
                that we are debating punishment beatings as a result of a DUP
                motion, when numerous Catholic homes have been attacked in
                places such as Larne and Coleraine. There has been a deafening
                silence from the Unionist communities on those sectarian attacks
                on Catholic homes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Roy Beggs said that he could not support the
                amendment because of its source and its objective. I cannot
                understand how anyone can object to the creation of an
                accountable policing service that enjoys the support of all
                communities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Billy Hutchinson said that there was a need
                to change attitudes and that the only way we could avoid
                punishment beatings was to find alternatives. I agree fully with
                that. We need to work with the community in the interim period
                when we do not have an acceptable policing service in order to
                ensure that the community has a say in finding non-violent means
                of dealing with this matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Monica McWilliams talked about the
                multi-agency approach. We have been working on addressing the
                policing deficit and spearheading a multi-agency approach. We
                are working with all statutory agencies to try to eradicate
                punishment beatings — west Belfast being a good example of
                that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will not bother to comment on most of what
                Sammy Wilson said. He, like some others in the Chamber, was not
                listening when I said that I did not condone punishment beatings
                and that my party does not condone them. He also talked about a
                one-party police state. We have good experience of that because
                that is what we have had for the past 80 years — a one-party
                police state controlled and abused by the Unionist community.
                There has been plenty of experience of that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">John Kelly talked about the lack of a fair
                and impartial policing service. I have addressed that. There has
                certainly been a huge gap in proper policing, which has led to
                this situation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Eileen Bell was definitely suffering from
                &quot;rose-coloured spectacles&quot; syndrome, for there has
                been plenty of evidence of international criticism of the RUC,
                including criticism from the United Nations rapporteur. The RUC
                has been indicted by many credible organisations, both at home
                and worldwide, and has a horrendous record of human rights
                abuses. That speaks for itself.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As for what Alex Attwood said about my
                Colleague John Kelly, Mr Kelly said that punishment beatings are
                wrong and have no place in any civilised society. Unfortunately,
                in the absence of fair and impartial policing for all, it is a
                reality that so-called punishment attacks will continue until we
                eradicate the policing deficit.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Féin has been working incredibly hard
                on the policing issue since the Good Friday negotiations, and
                indeed long before that. Today our leadership is in London,
                working to bring about the new beginning in policing that our
                community not only wants but needs. Nobody is saying that the
                Nationalist/Republican community does not need or want a
                policing service that will work for it. We have to create an
                accountable policing service acceptable to all people. No one
                can refute our efforts to support non-violent solutions to try
                to solve this problem. Go raibh míle maith agat.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This has been a sombre debate at times. I am
                very pleased that my party was able to get the motion onto the
                Floor of the House and that we have had a chance to deal with an
                issue that quite rightly concerns anyone who is interested in
                getting the people who carry out these evil, atrocious and
                brutal attacks made amenable to the law. I regret that the SDLP
                does not want to make those people amenable to the law and will
                therefore not be supporting this motion. It is unfortunate that
                it has not been able to pick up the gauntlet, to face the
                challenge and to run with those of us who want to see people
                made amenable to the law for their illegal actions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like most people, I am disgusted that Sinn
                Féin attempted to bring in a wrecking amendment on this issue.
                What was the purpose of its amendment? Its purpose was to take
                the spotlight away from its own guilty, blood-soaked hands on
                this issue.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In reality, Sinn Féin does not want to be
                held accountable for the actions which are engaged in by its
                organisation and which that organisation orders to take place.
                Sinn Féin, in its amendment, wants to blame everybody except
                those who carry out the punishment beatings. It wants to blame
                the Housing Executive, the Government agencies, the RUC —
                everyone but the man who is swinging the baseball bat. The real
                responsibility lies with its paramilitary organisation. Unless
                Sinn Féin faces up to that responsibility — and unless the
                Government accept their responsibility to take on those men of
                violence — we will be back, in a matter of months, to debate
                the increase in paramilitary attacks that will have continued to
                take place throughout our country.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This debate on punishment attacks is marked
                by the fact that, over the last few months, terrorists have
                maximised the number of punishment attacks and the level of
                terrorism. Meanwhile, those people and party members associated
                with the Belfast Agreement have taken a minimalist approach.
                They say as little on it as they can get away with; they condemn
                it quietly; they neither raise the issue nor allow it to make
                headlines. They take a minimalist approach that has served as a
                nod and a wink to the terrorists to carry on with their
                maximalist approach, which sees approximately five paramilitary
                attacks taking place in our country every week. This approach
                causes widows to be harmed, children maimed, and people’s
                lives to be destroyed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The reality, which is made clear in Prof
                Colin Knox’s report, is that those parties which could do most
                to stop the beatings are doing the least. We have seen an
                example of that in this Chamber today. The parties that could
                stop it will not do so. They want to blame everyone except their
                own foot soldiers, and they will not take the measures that they
                should be taking to switch off violence. The evidence of that is
                very clear. During the first presidential visit to Northern
                Ireland by Bill Clinton they were able to switch off the
                violence for a certain number of days and then switch it back
                on. The Chief Constable told us, at the time, that they were
                able to change the cycle of the violence and, on the basis of a
                command from an IRA officer, to switch the scene of an attack
                from Belfast to Londonderry. They were also able, at the command
                of an officer, to switch an attack from one in which people were
                shot in the knees to one in which they were shot in the elbows.
                They have a direct say in these attacks, and the evidence is
                clear that these people could stop this violence if they wanted
                to.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Punishment attacks are the stock-in-trade of
                the paramilitary organisations, so I almost recognise that they
                will be hypocritical about this issue. We take their hypocrisy
                as read. By bringing this motion before the House, we have also
                pointed the finger at the British Government and the Executive
                for failing to take action where it is possible to deliver on
                these issues. The Government’s lackadaisical approach of
                seeing no evil and hearing no evil must be condemned. It is
                deplorable that such a policy should condemn 15-year-old
                children to the most ritualised, summary, abusive regime in the
                British Isles — and that is what is happening.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this politically correct world we are
                right to condemn child abusers and find ways to prevent and
                convict them. Many Members would do a 15-minute stint in front
                of a camera to help bring in measures to prevent a child abuser.
                Those same people do not seem to want to run to the cameras to
                condemn the paramilitaries with the same voracity with which
                they condemn other issues of political correctness. There is a
                deafening silence from those people. The media cannot find them
                when they need to hear these people’s condemnation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the debate we heard from the Women’s
                Coalition, and it was clear from the comments of the party
                spokesperson that she had not read the entire report. I note
                that the Member quoted from the summary of the report. If she
                had been in the Chamber during the whole debate she would have
                known more about the report and the extensive work that was
                carried out.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Prof Knox and Dr Monaghan presented, in just
                one section of their report, more than 25 specific measures to
                deal with violence. A quite deliberate attempt is being made by
                some to ignore the fact that there is a way to deal with this
                violence in an effective manner.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a way to deal effectively with this
                violence. The fact is that the political parties in the
                Government know who are behind these attacks, yet it is probable
                that the issue has not even been put on the agenda of the
                Executive Committee. You can understand why there would be very
                uncomfortable shifting on seats in room 21 if the issue of
                paramilitary attacks happened to be on the agenda of the
                Executive of this place. The Minister of Education could name
                and shame the people who carry out those attacks if he really
                wanted to. He could indicate people in his own organisation who
                carry out those attacks, but he does not do it. Perhaps that is
                because those people are too close to his family home.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The misnamed Chief Whip of Sinn Féin/IRA
                could take the opportunity to reveal to the House the name of
                the chief bludgeoner for Belfast IRA company if he really wanted
                to. But, of course, his party does not want to name and shame
                people; that might be too close to home. Instead of getting his
                people in this Assembly to put forward wrecking motions, Mr
                Adams could, if he wanted to, bring forward motions or use the
                privilege of this House to name and shame those behind the
                attacks in Belfast. Perhaps those names are too close to his
                home for comfort also.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In reality, Mr Deputy Speaker — and I use
                the words carefully — brothers, nephews, brothers-in-arms of
                that organisation represented in this House are behind these
                attacks. That is the reality; that is what the police say, and
                perhaps we should take the opportunity and the privileges
                afforded to us in this House to name and shame those
                individuals. My Colleague came close to it. Perhaps that is
                called for because it is clear from the comments we have heard
                from members of the Nationalist community that they have no
                shame. They have no shame in what they are saying; if they had
                any shame, they would be supporting this motion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alban Maginness’s contribution was more
                disappointing than normal. Once again he has washed his hands of
                any responsibility. In fact, I almost heard the creak in his
                neck when he looked over his shoulder at Sinn Féin and the
                electoral responsibilities that will be facing him. Those
                parties take a view that is quite clearly political. They have
                lost sight of justice, decency and truth on this issue.
                Paramilitarism and paramilitary attacks have soared. It is easy
                to conclude from Prof Knox’s report that the agreement has
                failed to defeat paramilitarism in this country in any way, and
                those who let the prisoners out of jail are responsible. The
                increase in these attacks is the predictable outcome of prisoner
                releases. We must be crazy if we thought that the release of
                paramilitary prisoners would not see an increase in violence on
                our streets. It clearly has.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No, this motion goes right to the heart of
                the realities that confront us today. The cancer at the heart of
                these institutions — putting gunmen into government —
                establishes a Mafia society and erodes the very fabric of the
                society that we wish to live in. Indeed, it also turns the vast
                majority of democratic, law-abiding, decent citizens off taking
                responsibility and seeing this matter carried through to an
                ultimate and lawful conclusion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many of the comments made to the House by Ms
                Courtney and Mr &quot;not so legal eagle&quot; Attwood are
                misguided. The Belfast Agreement does not — to use Mr Attwood’s
                words — offer &quot;our future best hope&quot;. To Ms Courtney
                I say that the Good Friday Agreement is not &quot;the only means
                of getting rid of these so-called paramilitary attacks&quot;.
                Prof Knox has presented cogent evidence that the Good Friday
                Agreement is failing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Good Friday Agreement is failing to stop
                these violent attacks. Prof Knox’s report is thrown down as a
                gauntlet to us all. We have a responsibility to pick it up, vote
                and demonstrate our abhorrence of these paramilitary attacks.
                Those who fail to do so will show the community that they do not
                condemn paramilitary violence — they condone it.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the beginning of this debate a number of
                people expressed disquiet that Back-Benchers were limited in
                their speeches to five minutes. Mr Deputy Speaker, you advisedly
                told the House that as some 30 Members were listed to speak, the
                Business Committee had decided to limit Back-Benchers’
                speeches to five minutes. In the event, not all the time was
                taken up. I understand that this was because Members put their
                names on a list, on which you and the Business Committee formed
                your decision, and then withdrew their names. In effect, those
                who withdrew their names denied other Members the opportunity to
                deal with certain issues in this debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not always agree with Mr Billy
                Hutchinson, but he made the point that a significant part of the
                debate was not only about stating a problem but also about
                advising on what might be done about that problem. The time
                limitation meant that many aspects, such as those he mentioned,
                were ruled out. You should give direction to those Members who
                put down their names to speak and then withdraw.</p>

                point. You are correct. A number of people withdrew after
                indicating that they wished to speak. Also, some of those who
                spoke did not do so for the full five minutes. Members should
                note this point for future reference.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further to that point of order. Will the
                Deputy Speaker look at how many times this has happened before?
                To my knowledge it has happened on two other occasions. People
                put down their names, and the debate was limited. Then they
                pulled out. Those who wanted to speak did not get to speak, and
                those speaking, and entitled to more time by the ordinary rules
                of debate, were cut back. Those who do this consistently should
                be told that their names cannot be taken unless they give an
                undertaking that they are going to speak. At Westminster when

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Madam Deputy Speaker [Ms Morrice] in the
                Chair)</p>
                </font></i><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I explained in my opening remarks to my
                motion of 29 Novemebr 2000, which called for the introduction of
                legislation to permit Sunday on-course betting, the outcome
                sought in relation to the overall proposal falls within the
                remit of two ministerial Departments. For that very reason I
                submitted this motion to the Business Office simultaneously with
                the one passed in this House in November.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The purpose of this proposal is to address
                any fears or concerns those employed, directly or indirectly, in
                the racing industry may have regarding the pending introduction
                of Sunday on-course betting. Acceptance of this proposal will
                also set aside any concerns that elected representatives may
                have regarding the level of protection available to those who,
                for religious or family reasons, cannot work on Sundays. I was
                conscious from the outset that legalising Sunday on-course
                betting would raise legitimate concerns for both employees and
                ancillary workers affected by such legislative reform.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All persons could be legally safeguarded by
                the introduction of adequate employment protection rights
                similar to those available to workers in England and Wales —
                pursuant to the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994. Such
                legislative measures could protect those I have already referred
                to — employees who, for religious or family-related reasons,
                cannot work on Sundays. The fact that an Act is already in place
                in England and Wales simplifies my role in proposing the motion,
                and, no doubt, it will also prove to be of immense assistance to
                the Minister of Higher and Further Education, Training and
                Employment when he commences the setting up of similar
                legisaltion for Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the record — to give Members some
                indication of the level of protection provided by the Act
                (Chapter 40) — I shall highlight the relevant provisions.
                Schedule 8, which relates to section 20, deals with &quot;Rights
                of Betting Workers as Respects Sunday Working&quot;. Paragraph 2
                of the same schedule defines &quot;protected betting
                worker&quot;. Paragraph 4 deals with &quot;Notice of objection
                to Sunday working&quot;. Paragraph 5 defines &quot;Opted-out
                betting worker&quot;. Paragraph 6 defines &quot;notice
                period&quot;. Paragraph 7 deals with &quot;Right not to be
                dismissed for refusing Sunday Work&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paragraph 9 deals with dismissals regarded as
                unfair by virtue of paragraph 7 or 8. Paragraph 10 deals with
                the right of the employee not to suffer detriment for refusing
                to work on Sundays. Paragraph 11 outlines the employer’s duty
                and the employee’s statutory right in relation to Sunday
                betting work. Paragraph 12 deals with the effect of rights on
                contracts of employment. Paragraphs 13 to 21 deal with many
                important issues, such as transitional modifications relating to
                maternity cases, dismissals on grounds of assertion of statutory
                rights, dismissal procedures agreements, and conciliation.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I said earlier, the fact that such an Act
                is in place elsewhere in these islands, having been passed by
                Parliament, is an assurance that comparable workers in England
                and Wales are fully protected. I am confident that if the
                applicable sections of the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act
                1994 were to be used by those responsible for drafting the
                Assembly’s legislation, we could fully protect our employees
                in matters pertaining to Sunday work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I therefore propose the motion in the clear
                understanding that the Minister of Higher and Further Education,
                Training and Employment, Dr Farren, can introduce protective
                legislation for all grades of workers, similar to that applying
                in England and Wales.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for Higher
                and Further Education, Training and Employment (Dr Birnie):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Late last year the Assembly passed a motion
                proposed by the instigator of this motion. That motion, back in
                November, dealt with the extension of betting. When, and if,
                this change does occur — and it is, of course, an open
                question as to what changes may occur in Great Britain and what
                implications they may have for the industry in Northern Ireland
                — it will have implications for the working conditions of
                workers in the betting industry in Northern Ireland. Hence this
                motion today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Among the most relevant previous pieces of
                legislation are the Sunday Trading Act 1994 in Great Britain,
                and its equivalent here, the Shops (Sunday Trading, &amp;c.)
                (Northern Ireland) Order 1997. The crucial distinction — which
                the mover of the motion has referred to — is that there is
                legislation in Great Britain which includes the betting
                industry, whereas our piece of legislation does not.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These various pieces of legislation attempt,
                within their differing remits, to establish that those workers
                who find themselves in activities that for the first time
                involve Sunday working will be given protection. In other words,
                they will not find themselves compelled to work on Sunday, and
                they will not be dismissed if they refuse so to work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I assume — or perhaps now know from what he
                has said — that Mr Bradley’s concern is that such provisions
                in the Sunday Trading Act in Great Britain and the Shops (Sunday
                Trading, &amp;c.) (Northern Ireland) Order 1997 should now be
                extended to include the betting and gambling industry in
                Northern Ireland. If this is done — if the situation arises
                where it needs to be done — the overarching European Union
                Directives will also be relevant, especially in the area of
                working time. In normal circumstances these limit the maximum
                working week to under 48 hours. Some Assembly Members might find
                a total working week limited to under 48 hours a rather novel
                concept, but that is now the general provision, which the UK,
                along with other EU states, has subscribed to. That will have
                implications for the issue of working on Sunday.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Chairperson of the Higher and Further
                Education, Training and Employment Committee, I will endorse the
                motion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will conclude on a more personal note,
                without wearing my Chairperson’s hat. I opposed Mr Bradley’s
                initial motion because of the implications that it had with
                regard to the working conditions that the Assembly is
                considering today. Of course, it is entirely right that if
                Sunday on-course track betting is allowed that the Assembly
                should seek to regulate it and provide adequate employment
                protection. My impression of the English and Welsh experience
                since Sunday trading was liberalised is that it is impossible to
                provide complete legal safeguards to protect workers who, for
                whatever reasons — family, social or conscience — cannot
                work on Sundays. Given that, I still hold that the ideal
                position is that this difficulty should not be entered into in
                the first place. I support this motion subject to that proviso.</p>

                I also support the motion. As Mr Birnie stated, it dates back to
                the legislative change in 1997, which did not include those who
                worked in the betting industry but did apply to shop opening
                hours and the hours that employees should work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If there is going to be Sunday racing in Down
                Royal, it is timely that provision should be made in law to
                ensure that no one is penalised or forced to work on Sundays.

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not going to trawl through everything,
                but the legislation goes on to discuss working times, including
                travelling when it is part of the job, working lunches and
                job-related training. That is all included in the legislation
                introduced by Adam Ingram.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The one omission that I noted is the issue of
                pay for those who work on Sundays. I was at Leopardstown last
                Sunday, where I saw Istabraq restore Ireland’s confidence for
                the Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham. I spoke to a few bookmakers
                at the racecourse who said that their clerks were possibly the
                best paid people in Ireland. Therefore we are not talking about
                bookies’ clerks, rather about the ancillary staff who work in
                the tote, catering and stewarding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I say to P J Bradley that we should put down
                a marker not just about working conditions and the issues of
                forcing people to work on Sundays or whether they are penalised
                for not working on Sundays but also about the type of wage
                structure that will exist for those people who work on Sundays.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion in the name of my
                Colleague. However, it strikes me that surely there should be
                employment protection laws which act as an umbrella to cover
                everyone. We live in a society that contains Catholics,
                Protestants, Muslims and Jews.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Forcing a Christian to work on a Sunday is no
                worse than forcing a Jew to work on a Saturday. We are now in a
                multicultural and multi-ethnic society and, overall, our
                employment laws should reflect that. I know that there are
                anomalies that come out from time to time, but we should try to
                be reflective of society as a whole.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr John Kelly raised an important point about
                the working conditions of staff. Does that also include
                night-time racing? There is more and more betting from foreign
                countries. Are people going to be made to work shifts? We should
                not have to deal with employment protection every time a motion
                comes forward with legislative proposals to provide employment
                protection rights for anyone. We should have employment
                protection rights for absolutely everyone in our society.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion calls on me to bring forward
                legislative proposals to provide employment protection rights
                for those directly or indirectly employed in on-course track
                betting. In case there is any misunderstanding, given the terms
                of the motion, I should emphasise that the people involved in
                this activity are in no sense without employment rights at
                present. They have the same employment rights as other
                employees. It is very clear from the remarks of the Member who
                moved this motion, and those of other Members, that the motion
                seeks to ensure that such workers should have extra protection
                with regard to Sunday working in the event of this Assembly
                making on-course betting on a Sunday legal. That is protection,
                in particular, from being compelled against their wishes to work
                on Sundays.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The question of the legalising of on-course
                betting on a Sunday is a matter for the Minister for Social
                Development. I understand that he has noted and is considering
                the debate and the outcome of the debate that took place on this
                general issue last December. If and when a decision is made to
                legalise on-course betting on a Sunday, I would be obliged and
                willing to introduce employment protection measures in tandem
                with any proposed legislation of that kind.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sorry that I was not here for the first
                part of the debate. When the issue of protecting people because
                of their religious convictions was discussed in the House of
                Commons, many promises were made — for instance, that Sunday
                would not be treated as an ordinary working day. Those promises
                have all been broken. Can the Minister assure us that if people
                have to work on a Sunday and it is against their convictions to
                do so, they will be adequately protected? Many people have had
                almost a revolution in their family, because Sunday was the time
                when all the family was present. Because of workloads, they now
                cannot even have a proper family reunion on a Sunday.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we are going to have Sunday working, then
                it should be recognised as a special day. Of course, I take the
                point — as I heard on the television — about other religions
                and their special days. The honour should be kept that was given
                to them originally on this sort of legislation.</p>

                keep their word a Colleague representing the same constituency
                as himself is not expected to keep his regarding measures
                contained in any legislation for which he is responsible. I
                assure the Member that the measures will be implemented in the
                spirit and the letter of any such legislation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The sort of protection involved would be the
                same as that which is now available to shop workers under the
                Sunday trading legislation. An on-course betting worker would
                have the right not to be dismissed for refusal to work on
                Sundays and not to suffer any detriment, such as denial of
                promotion or training opportunities, for that reason. Those
                rights would be enforceable by way of a complaint to an
                industrial tribunal, and I think that underlines the assurance
                that I have just given.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would also be appropriate to ensure that
                on-course betting workers would be able, without suffering
                detriment, to give their employer notice that they wish to opt
                out of a clause in their contract that requires them to work on
                Sundays.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Protections such as those — and others as
                detailed by Mr Bradley in moving the motion —might have to be
                considered, and that would be necessary, fair and just. I would
                be prepared to introduce those protections if Sunday on-course
                betting were made legal in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Colleague Mr O’Connor mentioned other
                days apart from Sunday that are regarded as sacred by people of
                different faiths. He said that there may be a case for
                considering the rights of those people whose faiths observe
                those days as sacred. There may well be a case for our examining
                the employment legislation with regard to such matters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, with regard to the motion, I assure
                Members that when it is necessary for us to take action we will
                do so in such a way as to provide adequate, fair and
                comprehensive protection to the workers who will be involved.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Bradley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As with my proposal, I will be brief in my
                winding-up speech. I thank the Higher and Further Education,
                Training and Employment Minister for his encouraging words; I
                also thank the Chairperson of the Committee and the other
                Members who share my views on employment protection. It is
                encouraging to hear that everyone shared those views.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remind Members that the previous
                Administration, under the then Ministers Ingram and Worthington,
                carried out a consultation process on all matters pertaining to
                the proposal to introduce Sunday on-course betting. The exercise
                also sought opinion regarding the rights of betting workers if
                on-course betting were permitted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report which followed the consultation
                process gave some very revealing information, particularly
                paragraph 4.7.2 headed &quot;To Provide Employment Protection
                Rights for Betting Workers Employed on Tracks if On-Course
                Betting on Sundays is Permitted&quot;. There was a poor response
                to that section of the pre-report survey. Only nine respondents
                were identified as being in the &quot;broadly content&quot;
                category. Those included people with track and horse interests,
                bookmaking interests, people associated with the Law Society and
                those described as church/religious-type bodies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So as not to mislead, the report explains
                that the Reformed Presbyterian Church of Ireland committee on
                public morals has indicated that employment protection is the
                absolute minimum required when Sunday on-course betting becomes
                a reality. In the category headed &quot;Some
                reservations/suggestions&quot;, only six returns are recorded.
                None of the six make any suggestions. Their submissions
                expressed a number of fears, including possible conflict and
                injustice between employers and staff, as well as pressures on
                employees to work on Sunday. One submission found it hard to
                accept the idea that there should be no detriment to a person
                who refused to work on Sunday. Fortunately, all the fears
                expressed in this section can be easily addressed in the
                proposed legislation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased to inform the House that in the
                third category, set aside to record unfavourable comments, not
                one objection is recorded. I repeat: there were no unfavourable
                comments. This significant fact alone demonstrates that the
                general public treated the consultation process with a degree of
                apathy. As I look around, I think that that apathy is reflected
                in this House also. I believe that many also demonstrated a
                level of tolerance, recognising that others may have, and are
                entitled to have, a different outlook regarding the subject, and
                that there is a need to adapt to meet other attitudes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I conclude with the same lines with which I
                ended my opening remarks. I propose this motion on the clear
                understanding that protective legislation for all grades of
                workers, similar to that which applies in England and Wales,
                must be introduced prior to, or simultaneously with, the changes
                regarding on-course betting approved by the Assembly on 29
                November 2000. I fully appreciate that the Minister of Higher
                and Further Education, Training and Employment, like his
                ministerial Colleague, the Minister for Social Development, who
                is dealing with the successful November proposal, has a very
                demanding workload that is not exactly lessened by a motion such
                as this. I believe, however, that both are fully aware of the
                benefit that my original motion, and this necessary follow-on
                proposal, will bring to the overall economy of the area.</p>

                three homes in Larne last night.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important in this kind of situation
                that people recognise the problems in the area. As elected
                representatives we should provide leadership. In raising the
                issue, I recognise that other areas of Northern Ireland such as
                Ballymena, Coleraine and Ballymoney have suffered from sectarian
                attacks in recent months. We must recognise that there is a
                major problem. Since October, over 30 pipe bomb attacks have
                occurred throughout Northern Ireland, quite a number of them in
                the Larne area.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The intention was to have this debate on a
                reasoned and sensible level, and for people not to get carried
                away. It is for them to provide the leadership, which the
                community is seeking elected representatives to provide. You all
                know that pipe bombs can kill and maim. Fortunately, there have
                been no serious injuries from the use of pipe bombs, whether in
                Larne or elsewhere, over the recent months.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is happening in Larne is a very complex
                issue. As someone who worked in the town for quite a
                considerable time, and who keeps in regular contact with
                constituents there, I know the complexities of the situation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">RUC statistics show that last year the police
                stated that there were 76 sectarian attacks in Larne. In
                reality, as we all know, there were probably a lot more because
                of the number of attacks that were not reported. There have been
                attacks on Catholic and Protestant homes. Looking at the
                statistics, I am sure that everyone will agree that the majority
                of them have been on the Catholic community there.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whether they are pipe bombs, petrol bombs or
                bricks being thrown through windows — as happened last night
                — the aim is to terrorise individuals and the whole community.
                In most of the attacks that have taken place, whether they are
                against Catholic homes or Protestant homes, the motivation is
                sectarian hatred. It is a sad fact of life that that is
                permeating society throughout Northern Ireland at the present
                time. Very often the targets are the elderly, the very young or
                single parents. There is a deep fear throughout the community in
                Larne and elsewhere at the present time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The very fact that we have the Army back on
                the streets of Larne indicates how serious the existing
                situation is. The sad thing — and this comes from someone who
                has worked in Larne and represents the Larne area — is that
                the image of Larne has been tarnished at home and abroad. When I
                raised the issue of the attacks with the Prime Minister last
                Thursday he was very well acquainted with what was happening in
                the area. This Thursday I and members of my party will be
                meeting the Chief Constable to discuss Larne and the issues that
                exist in other parts of Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The bottom line is that the rule of law must
                be restored in the streets of Larne and in other areas. The rule
                of law is breaking down in many parts of Northern Ireland for
                many different reasons. A big part of it is the whole question
                of sectarianism, whether it is Catholic sectarianism or
                Protestant sectarianism. While it is very much a rule of law
                issue, the community itself has a very important part to play.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The community must recognise that it has a
                responsibility, although we must bear in mind the fear that
                prevents many people not only from reporting attacks but from
                giving information to the legitimate security services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was a series of sectarian attacks in
                Larne and throughout east Antrim in the 1970s. Indeed, I was
                almost a victim of a sectarian bomb attack on St Comgall’s
                club in Larne. But for the grace of God and the fact that only
                the detonator and not the whole bomb went off, I would not be
                here today. Nonetheless, throughout the troubles Larne was a
                mixed housing area; by and large, there were no ghettos. Now,
                however, there are increasing concerns that people on both sides
                are trying to create such ghettos. That is not acceptable and
                more cross-community initiatives are needed to stop it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not saying that no such initiatives are
                happening; the building of the new YMCA youth club was a
                cross-community effort. This morning, the rector of St Cedma’s
                told me about the Close Encounter event taking place in Larne
                this weekend in another attempt to defuse the situation. I also
                welcome the Wave Trauma Centre’s initiative to help victims in
                Larne, regardless of the community from which they come. The
                Larne community must stand shoulder to shoulder and isolate
                those who are carrying out the attacks, but the people need our
                leadership.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the saddest things is that
                condemnation of the attacks has almost become a ritual. There is
                a need for new initiatives, and I hope for some worthwhile
                suggestions from Members today. I also want the Assembly to
                recognise that there are areas of social deprivation in Larne
                and that such areas suffer from all the associated social
                problems. The people need our help in many different ways, and
                we should provide it. Looking at what has happened in Northern
                Ireland in recent years, I feel that we can make progress only
                if people are prepared to talk to one another — one community
                to another and one individual to another. That could restore the
                normality that the people of Larne want.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Despite the apparent success of FG Wilson,
                new investment is still required in the borough of Larne. The
                six elected Members for the area have demonstrated that we can
                work together on economic and investment issues. I thank the
                many people who are working behind the scenes. They have my
                support, and that of the Assembly. I have tried to approach
                Larne’s problems in a reasoned and balanced manner. As elected
                representatives, we must help the people of Larne.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In doing so, I am reflecting the views and
                opinions of all decent, right-thinking people in our community
                who want to live in an atmosphere of real peace. I trust that by
                engaging in this measured and responsible debate — and I thank
                the hon Member for starting off in that vein — we are not
                becoming pawns in any overt or covert considerations driven by
                party political necessity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have listened and watched in sadness as
                opportunities to provide positive leadership in this sorry
                situation were missed. Instead, we have witnessed a slow slide
                into a process dictated by a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you
                tell a child often enough that he is a bad boy, he will become a
                bad boy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In common with certain other provincial towns
                such as Ballymena, Coleraine and Portadown, it almost seems that
                Larne has been selected for a process of communal character
                assassination. I leave Members to ponder for themselves how and
                why that process may have evolved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Larne was — and continues to be — an
                industrious, prosperous and pleasant town. In common with all
                towns, Larne has had its problems. However, the people of Larne,
                following in the tradition of their forefathers, did not sit
                down and bemoan their lot. Instead, they sought to challenge the
                spectre of unemployment by accepting the need to refocus the
                local economy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A forward-looking borough council and an
                active business and community sector sought ways to retrain
                their workforce. Partnership boards, community groups and
                agencies such as Larne Enterprises Development Company (LEDCOM)
                and the East Antrim Institute for Further and Higher Education
                have provided positive approaches to meet these challenges for
                their whole community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a matter of regret to those who have
                the best long-term interests of Larne and its people at heart
                that when the media were treated to a guided tour of the
                borough, the spotlight fell on a small number of rather nasty
                and negative incidents rather than on the positive features of
                the town.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, as is the way with media interest,
                the failure to accentuate the positive is matched by the ability
                to magnify the negative aspects of a situation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Instead of preparing papers for perusal by
                powers in a neighbouring state — a state, which incidentally,
                has a significant number of problems with urban crime and
                violence on its own doorstep — would it not have been in the
                interests of all the inhabitants of Larne to seek a united
                approach with the MLAs of East Antrim and the representatives of
                Larne? That would have enabled people to identify the real
                causes for the upsurge in antisocial behaviour in the town. It
                could be achieved by identifying those in the community who
                could influence people for the common good. By co-ordinating
                agencies, we could bring confidence and support to those who
                have felt uneasy and insecure, thereby isolating the real
                troublemakers and providing the RUC with the unqualified and
                total support that the force needed and deserved as it attempted
                to solve the problems for the benefit of all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be a good start if those who are
                inclined &quot;in foreign parts to roam&quot; — as the song
                says — could speak to those a little closer to home. It is
                evident from moves today that all East Antrim MLAs are willing
                to be proactive and constructive in solving this problem, and I
                congratulate my Colleague Mr Beggs for instigating a process
                today which I hope will aid that work. We need to have a
                co-ordinated community solution, and we need to find it quickly
                so that the town of Larne can once again focus on the task of
                attracting tourists and investors. We must be able to
                demonstrate that the traditional warm welcome which the gateway
                of Ulster has always shown to visitors is still there.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First of all, let us not try and brush things
                under the carpet. There are problems in Larne, and they need to
                be dealt with by all of us. We all have a role to play. There
                were three more incidents last night. Two Catholic families and
                one Protestant family had their windows broken. Regardless of
                who they are, no victim should be regarded as worse than any
                other victim. These people have had their lives turned
                upside-down by thuggish elements. It might be a stone or a
                bottle that comes through their window tonight, but they will
                sit there wondering what it will be tomorrow night.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We can talk about all the good things —
                Larne Enterprises Development Company, the council initiatives,
                and all the rest — but in reality there is what Archbishop
                Eames termed &quot;a culture of lawlessness&quot; in areas
                throughout Northern Ireland. Larne is certainly one of those
                areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ken Robinson talked about selecting an
                area for some sort of assassination of its reputation. In the
                1970s there was a Catholic school in Greenisland that had 400
                pupils. It closed down in 1992 with 27 pupils. Two years ago —
                a week after I was elected to this august body — one estate in
                Carrickfergus was systematically ethnically cleansed of its
                Catholic population. Now we are into Larne. There is no
                accident. Gary McMichael spoke on ‘Evening Extra’ last
                Thursday about elements in the Ulster Democratic Party being
                disaffected with the way things were going in places such as
                Larne, Ballymoney and Coleraine. Surprise, surprise. We see
                where all the incidents that make the news are happening.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a problem, and it has to be tackled.
                It is not just the UDA. There are people from the Protestant
                community whose homes are being attacked. I deplore those
                attacks. I want to focus on the need for more police action. We
                have been told about the number of police officers available and
                that there are extra patrols. There are, however, no arrests and
                no convictions. I speak as one whose home has been attacked on
                multiple occasions. I have given evidence in court, only to see
                the perpetrators go away with a community service order. The
                police and the criminal justice system must stand up for
                victims. Where are the 800 Special Branch officers? What are
                they doing? For 30 years they could contain the problem in
                Northern Ireland. Now they cannot contain what is going on in
                Larne, Ballymoney and Coleraine.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to see a different type of policing.
                We need to see a political decision made by the Secretary of
                State that this whole culture of lawlessness — drug dealing,
                the manufacture of counterfeit goods, money laundering and
                extortion — will be tackled head-on. We can all stick our
                heads in the sand, or we can face up to our responsibilities by
                calling for community action, and by calling for people to
                report what they know to the police. There are people in the
                community who know what is happening, and they have a moral
                responsibility to take that information to the police so that
                they can do the job they are there to do.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must say from the outset that I am appalled
                at this motion. It is the last thing that Larne needs. It would
                have better behoved Mr Neeson to get the six MLAs for the area
                to sit down together behind closed doors and talk to each other.
                Then we could have come up with a formula for tackling this
                issue instead of bringing it again to the attention of the
                media. There are people in Larne who are hurting. I want to
                state publicly that there is no justification for the
                terrorising or intimidation of any human being in Larne or
                anywhere else in Northern Ireland, be they Protestant or
                Catholic, black or white, Hindu or Jew. Everyone has the right
                to live peacefully and to be dealt with equally under the law.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Larne is no different from any other part of
                Northern Ireland. Mr Neeson gave us the statistics, but I want
                him to carry those statistics through. Let us look at those
                figures. Mr Neeson talked about 76 attacks in Larne. Fifty-three
                attacks have been on Roman Catholics, and 35 on Protestants.
                Members may notice that that does not add up to 76. However,
                there could have been four or five people in those houses. That
                is how the figures add up. There is an imbalance here. There is
                intimidation, but it is against both sides of the community. Do
                not try to make out that it is any worse than in any other
                place. Everyone suffers when there is a breakdown of law and
                order. We only have to look throughout Northern Ireland to see
                that, stemming from the Belfast Agreement, there has been a
                general breakdown in law and order.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I call upon the RUC to implement zero
                tolerance when dealing with people who harass, petrol bomb,
                firebomb and intimidate others. There is absolutely no room for
                intimidation in any society. The majority of decent people in
                Larne reject the lawlessness of the few and support their
                neighbours, regardless of creed or colour. It is time for the
                silent majority in Larne to speak out. We know what happened in
                Nazi Germany when the majority turned its back. We do not want
                that to happen in Northern Ireland. We definitely do not want it
                to happen in Larne.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The people of Larne need to realise that they
                have to come forward to the forces of law and order and report
                anything, no matter how insignificant it may seem. It will help
                the police to build up a dossier and bring these people to book.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have been appalled at some of the media
                coverage on Larne. Ulster Television is the worst offender. A
                programme on UTV last Friday evening featured an interview with
                a gentleman from the Seacourt estate. Watchers were led to
                believe that it was impossible for Roman Catholics to shop in
                Larne or go to the cinema. That afternoon I had walked the
                streets of Larne and was stopped by many members of the Roman
                Catholic community thanking me for my leadership — and they
                were shopping merrily in Larne. They were able to go into any
                shop that I entered; they were able to buy their groceries where
                I bought mine.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I call on the media to realise that Larne is
                no worse than any other town in Northern Ireland. In Coleraine
                last year there were 19 pipe bombs; in Larne there were two. In
                Coleraine there were 18 petrol bombs; in Larne there were 10.</p>

                in Larne there were 15. In Coleraine there were 13 firearm
                incidents; in Larne there were three. Let us have balance and
                the truth. Larne is a good town in which the majority of
                residents despise those who are creating havoc for a number of
                people.</p>

                It was interesting that Sean Neeson and Danny O’Connor both
                compared events in Larne in 1970 to what is happening in the
                present phase of sectarianism. It is not good enough to talk
                about this as being antisocial behaviour. It is not — this is
                a concerted, orchestrated attack on the Catholics of Larne,
                which extends to Coleraine and Ballymena. Roger Hutchinson
                provides figures on how many pipe bombs there were in Larne,
                Coleraine and Ballymena and says that Larne did not have that
                many. Even one pipe bomb in Larne is sufficient reason for
                concern.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People have spoken about members of the
                Protestant community in Larne being attacked, yet it is the
                Nationalist community that has borne the brunt of those attacks.
                There were 150 attacks on Catholics in the Larne area before
                Christmas last year. This year, those attacks are not abating
                but increasing, and there is a greater degree of indifference to
                what happens to the victims of those attacks. There is greater
                arrogance among those participating in the attacks and a greater
                feeling that they can get away with it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The term &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; is not
                too strong to use in relation to what is happening in Larne and
                in other areas of east Antrim. It is clear that the attacks are
                being orchestrated by Loyalist paramilitaries in the UDA and the
                LVF.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Their intention is quite clearly to
                ethnically cleanse those predominately Loyalist areas in Larne,
                Ballymena and Coleraine. They want to drive Catholics from their
                homes — homes in which they have lived for generations. Those
                families have shown remarkable courage, resilience and
                determination in standing their ground. That is why I think that
                it was right for Mr Neeson to bring the matter to the Floor.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">UTV is only reporting the news as it gets it.
                You cannot blame UTV, ‘the Irish News’, the ‘Belfast
                Telegraph’ or the BBC for what is happening. They can only
                report the news as it unfolds. I was listening to that man who
                was recently pipe bombed. He seemed a reasonable and reasoned
                man who did not attempt to make capital out of the attack on
                himself and his family, an attack that could have caused the

                you raising this matter? It is not a point of order.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will continue and conclude.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is happening in Larne deserves the
                condemnation of the Assembly. The Nationalist people in Larne
                deserve our support and the support of the whole community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ken Robinson referred to visits to Dublin.
                The Irish Government, together with the British Government, have
                a distinct responsibility to support those people in Larne —
                people who have lived in Larne all those years and who were born
                and reared there. They deserve the support of all Governments
                and all interested people in our society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is quite nice to talk about Larne being
                the gateway to this or that. At the present time, and in the
                present atmosphere, Larne is being visited by a degree of
                sectarianism unparalleled since 1970.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Boyd:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am speaking not as an East Antrim MLA but
                as an ordinary citizen. Mr Roger Hutchinson has pointed out that
                Larne mirrors many parts of Northern Ireland. At the outset I
                want to condemn utterly the sectarian attacks in Larne on both
                Protestants and Roman Catholics. My condemnation of paramilitary
                violence, from whatever source, has been consistent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is regrettable that the SDLP
                representative for East Antrim, Mr Danny O’Connor, gives the
                impression on nightly media interviews that attacks are
                happening only against the Roman Catholic community. RUC
                statistics reveal that many Protestants have also been
                intimidated in the Larne area. Mr O’Connor refers to ethnic
                cleansing in the 1970s. My uncle and his family, along with many
                other Protestants, were ethnically cleansed from New Barnsley in
                the 1970s. Larne town centre was bombed twice by the Provisional
                IRA in the 1970s.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some criticisms from Nationalist elected
                representatives against the RUC in Larne are unwarranted and
                unjustified. The impression has been given that no one has been
                apprehended for these attacks. The RUC has stated that it has
                arrested 25 people in connection with these criminal acts. The
                situation is inflamed by the type of inaccurate public
                statements that I have already mentioned. A minority on both
                sides is intent on causing division in Larne. It is hypocritical
                of Danny O’Connor to demand more RUC resources, including
                covert operations, when his party is demanding the destruction
                of the RUC and the full implementation of the Patten Report,
                which would result in a reduction of RUC resources. Will Danny O’Connor
                call on young Roman Catholics in Larne to join the RUC? For
                years the SDLP has been critical of covert security force
                operations, including those that have been successful in
                capturing ruthless terrorists. I trust that Nationalist
                representatives in Larne will condemn the provocative flying of
                the tricolour in parts of the borough.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One leading Nationalist from Larne, Bertie
                Shaw, is currently charged with the attempted murder of two
                Protestants in the town in 2000. In 1999 the same Mr Bertie
                Shaw, along with Gerard Rice from the Ormeau Road, organised a
                Nationalist protest at an Orange cultural event at the
                Waterfront Hall. My wife and I and others were kicked and
                punched on the way in to the event. Some young children were too
                frightened to enter the building. The SDLP did not condemn this
                violence against innocent Protestants celebrating their culture.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The community in Larne should assist the RUC,
                and all elected representatives should act responsibly and
                impartially. I agree with Mr Roger Hutchinson when he says that
                it would be better for the six East Antrim MLAs to get together
                rather than have a divisive debate such as this. I praise those
                elected representatives who have acted responsibly in condemning
                the violence, from whatever quarter. I regret to say that
                comments made by a small number of elected representatives have
                been irresponsible and have raised tensions in the Larne area.
                Everyone has the right to live in peace, free from violence and
                intimidation. Regrettably, the continuing implementation of the
                Belfast Agreement and its appeasement policy will most likely
                result in this violent activity spreading to other parts of
                Northern Ireland unless the Government demonstrate the will to
                defeat terrorism and restore the rule of law.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Neeson says that the rule of law has
                broken down. This is due to the release of prisoners under the
                Belfast Agreement, the strengthening of paramilitary
                organisations through the elevation of their representatives to
                political office and the supply of unlimited funding for their
                organisations.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ervine:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To defend Larne by simply pointing out that
                it is not as bad as somewhere else is a poor defence. To deny
                that something is happening, then admit that it is happening,
                and then ask us all to get together to do something about
                something that is allegedly not happening is rather strange.
                Nevertheless, ethnic cleansing is nothing new in Northern
                Ireland. It is nothing new in our six counties of Northern
                Ireland in one way or another. Mr Kelly had ample opportunity to
                tell us of the annoyance inflicted on the Protestant community
                in Londonderry last evening. He did not do this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We can all be a bit hypocritical, but the
                fact is that ordinary decent people are suffering. Irrespective
                of the political games and chicanery that people want to indulge
                in, if we do not do something about it as a society, some of our
                constituents will die. That is the unadulterated truth, and our
                history tells us that it will happen.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We exhort the RUC to do better. That is
                logical, but there comes a time when the tolerance of society is
                turned upon those who are absolutely intolerant. Those people do
                what they are doing in Larne, Coleraine, Ballymena or Ballymoney,
                whichever side of the community they come from, because they
                think they have a right to act like this. If you happen to be in
                the Unionist community, for example, you might feel that you are
                the last bastion of defence and say &quot;I’ll do something
                about it.&quot;</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How many ex-prisoners are involved in this
                terrible trouble in Larne? None, or very few. Yet our leaders
                cry foul. Ludicrous stuff comes from the mouths of politicians;
                they tell us that we have been sold out, that the other side is
                winning. When people are given the impression that they are
                locked into a zero-sum battle, then, with a perverted sense of
                duty, some of them may feel that they have a legitimate cause
                for action. It is called populism.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are told that those who advocate the
                demolition of the Good Friday Agreement perhaps have their own
                little part to play. Nevertheless, their campaign and their
                threat to scupper it all by walking out create a constant hype
                and fear in the minds of the Unionist community. Those who fired
                the bomb at Ebrington barracks this morning and those who were
                swiftest to condemn it have the same goal. They both want the
                destruction of the only opportunity that this society has ever
                had to live in peace in my lifetime, and perhaps the only
                opportunity that my children and my children’s children will
                have.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have an affinity with Larne. I lived there
                as a child — those were my days of innocence, and perhaps
                Larne’s days of innocence. Today, even while they talk about
                the suffering of innocent people and the need to defend the
                integrity and decency of what is a wonderful place, two of our
                Members have also spoken about their need to destroy the Good
                Friday Agreement. For them it is evil; vile; terrible;
                deplorable; shameful; and stinking. I am not quoting them, but
                they may well have said this at some time in the past or may do
                so in the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In reply to those Members, I want to say
                &quot;It is simple — just walk out.&quot; Not only could the
                couple here at the moment walk out, but the massed ranks as
                well. They choose not to do so. Instead, while ordinary, decent,
                innocent people suffer, they earn £39,500 per year, eulogising
                and chasing television cameras to make sure that they get
                re-elected.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you come from the Protestant community and
                realise how painful it was when people were ethnically cleansed,
                it is even more shameful then to inflict the same on somebody
                else who is also wholly innocent. The choices are clear. What is
                going on in Larne and in other parts of Northern Ireland is
                either right or wrong. We must choose. Do we create a culture
                and an ethos where we, the tolerant society, identify the
                intolerant and deal with them, or do we pay mealy-mouthed
                lip-service to division and thus give these people justification
                for their actions?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Beggs:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As one of the two Assembly Members who
                actually lives in the Larne borough, I hope to give some insight
                into what I have discovered is happening in my town. I aim to
                show that the impression given over the past weeks and months
                does not give the full picture, and I want to send a positive
                message about what Larne can become.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I want to send a clear message to the
                men of violence in our society. Stop. You are acting for no one
                but yourselves — you have no mandate. Since I was elected to
                the Assembly I have consistently condemned those in my
                constituency who have been engaged in terrorism, whatever the
                level and whatever the source. I will continue to do so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, we must all go beyond the ritual of
                condemnation. We must analyse what is wrong, and prescribe a
                remedy. I would like Members to assess what they are saying and
                doing, both here and in the public domain, that is constructive
                and that is helping to solve the problems.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The recent troubles in Larne need to be put
                into context, and in doing so, the perceptions created about the
                town by the local and national media have to be changed, for
                they are inaccurate. Yes, we have failings, but Larne is not the
                hellhole that some people describe it to be.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the year 2000 there were 76 separate
                incidents described as sectarian. Of those affected, 53 people
                were Catholics and 35 were Protestants. The incidents ranged
                from pipe bombings, petrol bombings, vandalised cars, assaults
                on people and on homes, and threatening letters. It is clear
                from the figures that the attacks are coming from both sides.
                Yet, what are we getting in the media? Even last night, the
                commentary on some of the provincial media about what happened
                in the town was totally unbalanced. There was a tit-for-tat
                attack in Larne last night. A beer bottle was thrown into a
                Protestant home, and bricks were subsequently thrown into two
                Catholic homes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All attacks are wrong. However, some aspects
                of the media, and some representatives, portray the attacks as
                coming entirely from one side. There is criminality in both
                communities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">UTV Internet has actually metamorphosed some
                of the figures. A recent statement on the web site revealed that
                78 Catholic families in the town have been targeted last year.
                The figures have been lumped together and portrayed as coming
                from one side of the community. I have referred the matter to
                UTV, so I hope that it will correct its misreporting. Perhaps it
                is a case of not letting the facts get in the way of a good
                story.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I say this not to minimise any of the attacks
                that have happened to my Catholic constituents but to highlight
                the fact that there are troublemakers in both communities. If we
                are going to move forward together as a community, we must
                acknowledge criminality in both communities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Larne has been fortunate in many ways. It
                does not have terrorism to the same extent as many other towns
                in Northern Ireland. Therefore it is ironic that the troubles
                that we have at present are coming to a level exceeding that in
                many other locations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must not allow bigots to destroy our
                community in Larne, and they are not exclusively on one side.
                Many of the problems have emanated from the Seacourt estate,
                where local Republicans have said to neighbours &quot;We are
                going to turn this estate into a Nationalist ghetto or bring it
                to the ground.&quot; They are bringing the estate to the ground,
                terrorising completely innocent neighbours and those who have no
                involvement in terrorism or in politics.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There needs to be a realisation in the
                Nationalist community of the failings of these criminals, for
                many of these people have criminal records. Many of them
                continue to be sought by the courts for criminal activities.
                However, we have to move forward positively. In doing so, I
                would like to advise the House that there have been positive
                moves behind the scenes with groups and individuals. I welcome
                the fact that six Assembly Members have signed a letter, which I
                drafted, calling for the Office of the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister to utilise Peace II funding to improve
                community relations in Larne.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr A Maginness:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate Assemblyman Roger Hutchinson
                on his very powerful condemnation of the violence in Larne, and
                I congratulate other Members also. I want to say to him, and to
                the other Members of the House who have spoken, particularly
                those on the Unionist side, that there is a very deep well of
                sectarianism in our society. It is a poisoned toxin that infects
                and damages the body politic and the fabric of our society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I believe that places such as Larne,
                Ballymena, Ballymoney and Coleraine are suffering from the
                effects of that toxin. There is something disturbing going on in
                those communities. However, that disturbance and violence would
                not arise unless the culture of sectarianism was embedded in the
                social organisation of those communities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not enough to condemn — right and
                proper as that is — those who carry out the acts of violence.
                We must look inside ourselves and ask if there is something that
                we can change about our sectarian attitudes that will remove
                this poison and help create a new and healthy society that
                respects human rights. Human rights are the bedrock of the Good
                Friday Agreement. We have heard about attacks on people’s
                homes. Those are attacks on human rights. Those are attacks on
                the right to liberty and security of the person. An attack on a
                person’s home may also constitute an attack on the right to
                life. Human rights are being damaged and attacked by those who
                perpetrate this violence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members have been talking about violence
                as if it were some sort of epidemic — almost something that
                happened as a result of some sort of inexplicable outbreak.
                However, we are not talking about casual sectarian violence.
                There may be some casual sectarian violence, but we are talking
                about organised sectarian violence in Larne. I pay tribute to
                Danny O’Connor for highlighting and being forthright about
                this issue.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I concur with some of the Member’s
                comments, but he should bear in mind that a crosscommunity women’s
                group — perhaps relevant to himself — in the Seacourt estate
                was forced out of action by Republicans. It is coming from both
                communities.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr A Maginness:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have no doubt that there is violence on
                both sides in Larne. However, it must be said — and Danny O’Connor
                has said openly and courageously — that there is organised
                violence in that town and in that area. The majority of that
                violence has been visited upon the minority Catholic community
                that lives in the borough. In addition, he says that it is his
                belief that it is organised by the UDA or organisations
                associated with the UDA. I believe that, and I believe that the
                police have confirmed it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot understand why, in a town of 20,000
                people — it is not a big town — the police cannot come to
                grips with that sort of organised violence. Casual violence is
                more difficult to eradicate. However, organised violence, which
                requires somebody to make pipe bombs, petrol bombs and weapons
                with which to attack homes, should surely be detected and
                suppressed by the police. Assemblyman Roger Hutchinson asked
                that very question himself on a radio programme. It goes to the
                heart of the concerns of Catholic people living in that area.</p>

                action on this? This is not such a big nut for the police to
                crack. I commend those who have constructively criticised the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like other Members who have taken part in
                today’s debate, I totally condemn the unsavoury incidents
                currently taking place in Larne. It saddens me that the severity
                of the situation has led to the matter being brought before the
                House today. It is right to condemn the attacks in Larne, as
                well as similar activity taking place in other areas throughout
                the Province.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have before us a terrible vicious circle.
                Attack provokes attack; retaliation provokes retaliation, and at
                the end of the day, both communities are losing out. The cost to
                individual families is immense, with ruined lives, wrecked homes
                and vast medical problems which, unfortunately, will surface in
                the days ahead.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no one section of our community with
                a monopoly on suffering. The statistics released by the RUC that
                are being quoted today give the true facts on the problem. Both
                communities are under attack — indeed, members of the DUP have
                been attacked in Larne by Republicans. Loyalists too must take
                responsibility for their actions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, what we have witnessed to date
                is that he who shouts loudest is the victim. That is the
                perception coming out of Larne. I call on all local politicians
                and community leaders to disregard point scoring. Let us get to
                grips with the situation here at the grass roots and put the
                heart back into Larne.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The embryo of a similar problem was beginning
                to emerge in Carrickfergus last year. Local civic and community
                leaders came together, stood their ground and headed off the
                problem. No one had to run to Dublin, London or elsewhere. The
                matter was sorted out on our own doorstep, without adding
                provocation to the situation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The story in Larne is no different from that
                in any other place in Northern Ireland. Something that, perhaps,
                starts off as being a case of nuisance neighbours ruins good
                communities, and lack of action — particularly on the part of
                statutory agencies such as the Housing Executive — leaves a
                void that is taken up by the more sinister elements. The results
                are the same — a huge cost in human suffering, population
                displacements and, more often than not, perfectly good housing
                demolished owing to the increasing number of voids.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We do not want to see that in any part of
                Larne. Let us not allow that to happen in Larne. Let us not see
                events spiralling any further, as we have witnessed in interface
                areas in North and West Belfast and in other constituencies. We
                must take up the slack and tackle the problems head-on. The rule
                of law and order must be applied to all, irrespective of their
                political or religious affiliation.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. I
                suppose it is not my job to point out to you that this dialogue
                was timed to take place between 5.00pm and 6.00pm, yet, despite
                our having been encouraged to nip our commentaries short, we
                find ourselves, at 5.18pm, going home. Even the capacity to give
                way is destroyed by the short-termism that is being foisted on
                us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I realise that you,
                Madam&nbsp;Deputy&nbsp;Speaker, have made a decision, which I am
                not likely to be able to overturn, but I ask that you — along
                with the Speaker and the other Deputy Speakers — give some
                consideration to this problem. This is the second time today
                that this matter has been raised as a point of order in the
                House.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further to that point of order, Madam Deputy
                Speaker. I am gravely concerned. Many of us had prepared
                speeches containing lots of statistics which we were not able to
                quote. We rushed our speeches through to comply with your
                ruling. The situation in Larne is severe, which is the very
                reason I felt that this debate should not take place today. We
                were cut short, and things that should have been said could not
                be said. I am afraid that today’s debate has served no purpose
                whatsoever.</p>

                is now 5.19pm. We had five minutes extra because one Member
                withdrew. That is why we have a few minutes left over. If there
                are problems with this, they should be taken up with the
