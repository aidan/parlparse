                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been substantial interest in the
                motion that is coming up and substantial interest in speaking in
                the debate. I already have a long list, and I expect that it
                will get longer. I therefore see little option other than to
                make the same arrangements as were made for yesterday’s debate
                — to give the mover, Dr&nbsp;Paisley, 10&nbsp;minutes to open
                and five&nbsp;minutes for his winding-up speech, the Minister
                10&nbsp;minutes to respond prior to the winding-up, and
                five&nbsp;minutes for all other Members taking part. This will
                ensure that as many Members as possible will have the
                opportunity to contribute. I seek the leave of the Assembly to
                proceed in this fashion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr&nbsp;Speaker. This
                motion has the backing of the whole Committee, and I would have
                liked more time to introduce it. However, I appreciate that
                there is widespread interest among Members and that they have
                constituency interests. In the interests of the Committee, I am
                content — not happy — to accept the 10&nbsp;minutes, with
                the further five&nbsp;minutes at the end.</p>

                <i>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Robert Coulter:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr&nbsp;Speaker. I have
                no problem with the spirit of the motion; in fact, I will be
                supporting it wholeheartedly. However, I have some difficulty in
                understanding the intention of the expression in
                line&nbsp;three. Is it singular or plural? Students of the
                classics will know that the word &quot;crisis&quot; comes from a
                Greek root. If, therefore, the intention is plural the spelling
                should be &quot;crises&quot;. However, if the intention is
                singular the syntax is defective in that the indefinite article
                has been omitted — it should read &quot;a serious
                crisis&quot;. For the sake of accuracy, I ask that the motion be
                corrected.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful to the Member for drawing that
                to my attention and for giving me notice of it, which enabled me
                to check the original submitted by Dr&nbsp;Paisley. It said
                &quot;a serious crisis&quot;. There was an administrative
                typographical error, and we take full responsibility for that.
                When we reach the vote I will remind Members that the motion
                should read &quot;a serious crisis&quot;. I hope that that
                clarifies the matter.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Beggs:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr&nbsp;Speaker. I seek
                direction. I was one of the Members who had questions down for
                oral answer by the Health Minister yesterday. Questions
                finished, I think, at No&nbsp;3, and mine was No&nbsp;7. I went
                up to my pigeon-hole immediately after the debate, but there was
                no answer there. Nor is there an answer in Hansard. When may I
                expect to receive an answer?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. That is not a point of order for the
                House; it is an administrative matter in respect of the
                Executive. However, I will certainly explore the matter and try
                to get an answer for the Member.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I beg to move the following motion:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This House contends that the cuts in farm
                incomes, the market pressure on each sector of agriculture and
                the lawlessness of the French Government constitute a serious
                crisis in the Northern&nbsp;Ireland agriculture industry and
                calls on the Northern&nbsp;Ireland Executive to recognise this
                and take emergency measures to save the industry.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The agriculture industry is facing a very
                serious crisis, perhaps even a catastrophe, and I am not happy
                with the way in which the Department of Agriculture is handling
                this matter. Many of my friends in the farming community feel
                that the Department is acting against them and not for them. My
                views are known both to the Committee and to the Minister. The
                Minister should release herself from the trammels of her
                Department, take it by the neck and make it reverse the policies
                that have led to the ruination of the farming community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is not the time for a velvet tongue or
                soft words. Farming is the largest industry in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland. It employs more people than any other
                industry, and it is dying. It is not a matter of it’s being on
                a life-support machine; the undertaker is waiting to measure the
                corpse and bury it. The Minister and her Department must now
                change their attitude towards this crisis. I have not found
                evidence of any change of mind in the Department — and I say
                that with regret, for I have a good relationship with the
                Department’s officials, but they just do not realise how
                serious this crisis is.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recently I, along with some other Members,
                met bankers and meat processors. I asked the bankers how many of
                them were going bankrupt, but it seems that their incomes are
                tremendous. I also asked the meat processors if any of them were
                going bankrupt or preparing to commit suicide. They all laughed
                and said &quot;Not at all. &quot; I informed them that in the
                farming community, and especially in the pig industry, some
                farmers had already committed suicide. Many of the farmers are
                going bankrupt, and homes where their families have lived for
                generations are being sold over their heads.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of us are criticised when we stand up
                for the farmers. We are told that we are not interested in the
                consumers. The housewives of Northern&nbsp;Ireland have had no
                benefit. Indeed, they now pay more for their cuts of meat.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Agriculture is sick unto death, and we must
                do something to change this urgent situation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not happy about what the
                Prime&nbsp;Minister is going to say to farmers today. By
                standing among them and telling them to diversify what he is
                really saying is &quot;There is no room for you in the farming
                community; go and do something else.&quot; And he is saying this
                without any offer of compensation and without any possibility of
                the farmers’ being able to diversify. A farmer might diversify
                if he could get planning permission, but all constituency
                workers know how hard this is to obtain. It is difficult for
                them to get planning permission to build on the farms where
                their families may have lived for 300&nbsp;years. All that the
                Prime Minister can say is &quot;Diversify.&quot;</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Something radical needs to be done. Those who
                support the farming cause have been blamed for being very strong
                in diagnosis and very weak in prescription, but there are things
                that could and ought to be done. First, we need a new entrants’
                scheme to preserve the industry. There must be a future for
                farming. The Minister and her Department must now give an
                encouraging signal to new entrants. They must have some way of
                getting into farming. We must relax building control; we need a
                new special rural benefits structure; we need to initiate an
                agri-compensation scheme; we need to assist the Farmers’ Union
                and others in their battle to get low —- incidence BSE status;
                and we need a special injection of cash for pig projects. These
                are things that must be done.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Along with others who are interested, I have
                gone, cap in hand, to the Department and to successive
                Ministers. The Minister has, of course, inherited this situation
                — she is not responsible, and we are not blaming her for
                something she did not do. Nevertheless, we will blame her if she
                does not do something about it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have always been told that this cannot be
                done. I have been involved in Europe for 20&nbsp;years, and,
                without wishing to boast, I have some little experience of the
                European scene. If we were to exploit Europe in the way the
                Irish Republic does, the farming community would be far better
                off. We need to realise that there is, at present, money in
                Europe that we should be getting. DANI tells us that we cannot
                do this — of course, it is no longer called &quot;DANI&quot;,
                but I am a Puritan still living in the Dark Ages. We no longer
                want to listen to their saying that we cannot do it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Southern Government did it, and to say
                that the compensation scheme under which pigs were bought is the
                same as this is nonsense. The two&nbsp;schemes are entirely
                different; it is wrong to try to tell farmers that they are one
                and the same scheme and say to them &quot;You have already got
                your money&quot;. It is wrong to say that we cannot go with a
                scheme like the one in operation in the Irish&nbsp;Republic. We
                have to get something for the farmers, and we have to save our
                pig industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I put this question to the Minister: &quot;Do
                you want there to be no pig industry in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland?&quot; Half of it has almost gone, and, in
                a few weeks, half of the remaining half will be gone. That is
                how serious the situation is. This is an emergency, and in an
                emergency, one does not do ordinary things, one does
                extraordinary things. Something extraordinary has to be done to
                help the farming community. Every effort must be made to save
                this industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Farmers are the custodians of our soil. I
                detest the environmentalist lobby who tell us that the farmers
                can leave and that they will look after the countryside. That is
                ridiculous nonsense. These environmentalists who say &quot;We
                have a right to walk everywhere; we have a right to do this and
                a right to do that.&quot; are not thinking of the best interests
                of the custodians of the soil who, for generations, have kept
                this country going and ought to be honoured today. We should be
                determined, come what may, to do our level best to see that
                something is done.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The farmers that have come here today are not
                looking for nice words — they are looking for actions. This
                case can be easily made; we do not need to dwell on all of its
                complications or ramifications. Out there are decent people from
                both sides of the community who have invested their labour and
                their talents in order to help this country and keep it going,
                and they must be repaid. The talent in this Assembly, the talent
                in the Department, the talent of the Minister and the talent of
                our Committee must join forces. Let the message go out from this
                House that we are determined to save the farmers and to do the
                extraordinary if that is what is needed — and it is.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Savage:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The latest figures from the Department of
                Agriculture and Rural Development indicate that income from our
                agriculture industry fell by 22% between 1998 and 1999. It went
                down from £91&nbsp;million to £70&nbsp;million within
                one&nbsp;year. The total income from farming has fallen by 79%
                in five&nbsp;years, with the knock-on effect of hundreds of
                millions of pounds being lost to our economy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland is a very small country, and
                we cannot afford to continue with this level of economic decline
                in an agriculture industry that has a workforce of approximately
                85,000&nbsp;people. I applaud the efforts that have been made by
                the Ulster Farmers’ Union (UFU) to present reasonable policies
                to rescue an industry which has been drastically affected by a
                series of crises in the last few years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most recently, the French Government have
                chosen to become a law unto themselves by refusing to lift the
                ban on beef exports. Why should Ulster producers have to suffer
                because the French make a unilateral decision to ignore EU
                rules? Local producers have done everything required of them by
                the regulations. While the UK pursues the law-breaking French
                through the courts, it is not unreasonable to expect the UK
                Exchequer to aid local producers who are suffering as a
                consequence of France’s selfish and illegal actions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also support the UFU’s efforts to secure
                the release of the £50&nbsp;million to £60&nbsp;million of
                agri-money compensation which is available to us through EU-funding.
                Part of this funding is to protect common agricultural policy
                (CAP) area aid and livestock payments from the impact of the gap
                between sterling and the Euro. Another part is to offset the
                damage done to all farm commodities by the current strength of
                sterling. In both cases the release of the compensation funds
                depends on specific commitments and actions by the
                UK&nbsp;Government, and these have not been forthcoming.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I urge the Minister of Agriculture and Rural
                Development to lobby her Westminster and EU counterparts on our
                behalf. This is not a demand for extra money. It is a demand for
                compensation which is already available and budgeted for. I ask
                the Minister to support the UFU’s campaign to gain
                low-incidence status for Northern Ireland in respect of BSE and
                to secure the implementation of exceptional measures such as a
                one-off rescue package for the local pig industry, similar to
                that which has recently been concluded by the EU and the
                Irish&nbsp;Government. It is essential that we establish and
                promote a province-wide &quot;Buy Ulster&quot; campaign.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Opinion polls conducted last year by a local
                consumer affairs organisation presented evidence which showed
                that two&nbsp;thirds of the population would buy local produce
                if it were available and reasonably priced. Almost half of those
                surveyed also said that they would be willing to pay a little
                extra for good quality local produce. However, the national
                supermarket chains which have moved in to Northern Ireland in
                the last few years either refuse to source from the local market
                or do so for a farmgate price, which is economically non-viable
                for the local producer. This is absurd and unjustifiable. The
                supermarkets could actually help the local producers and the
                local economy by raising the farmgate prices while freezing the
                retail prices. That might decrease their profits in the short
                term, but in the long term it would stimulate the local economy,
                please the consumer and contribute to larger profits at a later
                date.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The agriculture situation in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland is more difficult than in other parts of
                the United&nbsp;Kingdom, not least because of the increased
                competition from across our land border with the Republic of
                Ireland.</p>

                Members in their opening remarks, so I will try not to repeat
                them. Since joining the Agriculture Committee I have found a
                great willingness on the part of the Chairman and members to
                address the plight of the farming industry. I am pleased to put
                on record that I pay tribute to the sincerity of all members of

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Bradley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to pay tribute to our Minister of
                Agriculture and Rural Development for her prompt actions and
                efforts to address the multitude of problems that faced her when
                she took office. In less than two&nbsp;months she has put a
                tremendous effort into tackling the ever-increasing problems of
                the farmers of Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers has taken up the problems of our
                fishermen. She has sought to have the aids to private storage
                scheme reopened and increased export refunds put in place on
                behalf of our pig farmers. These issues are of the utmost
                importance and must be worked at until a satisfactory outcome is
                achieved. Unfortunately, time is not on anyone’s side.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to compliment the Minister on her
                decision, which Mr&nbsp;Savage referred to, to seek special
                status for Northern&nbsp;Ireland in respect of BSE. The fact
                that we had only six recorded cases of BSE last year is surely a
                plus factor in her negotiations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If a start could be made on exporting our
                calves that would lay the foundation for further improvement. In
                a short time the number of calves would reduce, thereby reducing
                the number of cattle being finished on farms. There would be
                better factory prices owing to the reduced availability of beef
                cattle.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This weekend I spoke with one major livestock
                expert who advised me that if the ban on live exports were
                lifted, he could be in business again within 24&nbsp;hours,
                exporting calves to Spain and Holland. We are as close as that.
                However, any resolution must start with the British Minister of
                Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Nick&nbsp;Brown. In two
                recently published statements Mr&nbsp;Brown praised the efforts
                of Minister&nbsp;Rodgers when she made strong pleas to him for
                special BSE status for Northern&nbsp;Ireland. When Mr&nbsp;Brown
                puts our case to Europe I am confident that Ms&nbsp;Rodgers,
                together with my party leader, John&nbsp;Hume, whose record in
                Europe goes without saying, and the other MEPs will be able to
                accumulate sufficient support in Brussels for the concessions
                being sought. In respect of the future of farmers in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland, the ball is firmly back in
                Nick&nbsp;Brown’s court.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is fully recognised that many of the
                problems in agriculture are a result of a lack of interest on
                the part of the British Government. Their level of interest is
                on a par with the size of the Northern&nbsp;Ireland agricultural
                economy within the overall finances of the British Government.
                That is not good enough when thousands of our farmers are faced
                with financial ruin.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to make a special plea to those
                Members — many of whom are not in the Chamber this morning —
                who perhaps have no great interest in our farming community but
                have set their sights on bringing down the Assembly. It is my
                view that whatever chance of survival our agriculture industry
                has will be achieved only through the combined efforts of the
                Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, the Committee and
                the Assembly. I do not believe that Nick Brown in London or the
                British Administration in Brussels will thank or support us if
                we fly in the face of the Government’s wishes regarding
                devolution. I ask everyone to think seriously about our
                position. I believe that if the Assembly fails, the farming
                industry will come down with it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are the only hope, the only friends and
                the only lifeline our farmers have. We must not fail them in
                their hour of need. We also have to get our priorities right.
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland farmers and rural dwellers will be here at
                noon today seeking whatever help the Assembly can give. To bring
                the Assembly down, or even to attempt to bring it down, would be
                the equivalent of closing doors in the face of the farming
                community. I am confident that the sentiments outlined in the
                motion will receive the full approval of the House.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McHugh:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thank you, a Chathaoirligh. I want to address
                the issue of the agriculture crisis. The difficulty is that I
                have too short a time for my speech. We face a crisis, and I
                commend the farmers who are protesting.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was a protest here by the
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland Agricultural Producers’ Association (NIAPA)
                about two&nbsp;years ago. That too was at a time of imminent
                crisis when prices were just as bad as they are now. Farmers
                should have put their foot down then and voiced their concern to
                the Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope it is not a case of bolting the stable
                door when the horse has gone.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a desperate situation in the rural
                and farming communities. Much debt has built up, and there is no
                respite in terms of a renewed price rise or help from the
                Government, or anyone else. There are a number of reasons for
                the crisis such as the difference between sterling and the Euro
                and the backlog of the BSE crisis which still affects us. There
                is also the question of exploitation. Since 1974 and beyond
                farmers have been exploited and are still being exploited. The
                UK Government exploited them for cheap food and their only
                respite was in time of war. They are currently being exploited
                by retailers, processors and everyone beyond the farm gate, and
                those people are making exorbitant profits at their expense.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The figures that we received yesterday show
                that farm incomes have hit rock-bottom because of low prices and
                unfairness. The Ulster Farmers’ Union states that only £1 in
                every £30 on the business, processing and farming side goes to
                the farmer. The average beef carcass is worth £400 to the
                farmer, but it will cost the consumer £1,200, so the consumer
                is not winning as a result of low farm prices. Some people claim
                that the consumer can gain from this situation, but neither the
                consumer nor the farmer is gaining. Someone else is gaining in a
                big way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All the extras on the processing side such as
                £5 here and there were all traditionally passed back to the
                farmer as if he had a bottomless pit. Those industries should
                take their share of costs when the farmer puts his produce
                through their doors.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why are we at this point? We are told about
                the problems of the BSE backlog. We talk about BSE being
                history, but we never had a high incidence of BSE in the North,
                and we do not have it now. We hardly register on the bottom of
                the graph whereas in Britain, the incidence of BSE goes through
                the top of the graph. It will be difficult to achieve BSE status
                here because of the fact that the regulations have become more
                stringent. We will never get over that barrier. As long as we
                are tied to the situation in Britain we are hanged in terms of
                getting out of the BSE dispute with Europe.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We were told by the Department of Agriculture
                that the changes in the regulations in respect of tags that were
                imposed on farmers would get us back in to the European market.
                We could not implement those changes, so the objective was
                unachievable. The Department agreed to regulations that are now
                crippling farmers and preventing them from getting to the
                markets.</p>

                from 10.30&nbsp;am until to 12.30&nbsp;pm. What happens outside

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad to support this motion and to add
                to the large measure of agreement. I see that some DUP Members
                welcome the fact that I agree with them occasionally.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They might have referred to the fact that the
                UK Government must take action as well as our own Executive. The
                information we received on incomes clearly shows the extent of
                the crisis that still exists in the UK. It has bottomed out in
                England, Wales and Scotland but is continuing to get worse in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland. It is a disaster and is something which
                quite clearly needs particular attention here. However, that
                will be partly dependent on what Nick&nbsp;Brown does in
                Whitehall.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can understand why farmers question whether
                those in the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development —
                either the Minister or her officials — know what is going on.
                According to the statement issued by the Department yesterday, a
                large measure of the drop in income is attributable to the rise
                in input costs. Unfavourable weather conditions resulted in an
                increase in the amount of feedstuffs and fertilisers purchased.
                I do not claim to be an expert in this sector, but I find it
                difficult to see how bad weather could have affected pig meat
                production which is down 13%, poultry production, which is down
                6%, or egg production which is down 10%. I wish that the
                Department would stop covering up for what is going on in
                Whitehall and start arguing the case for farmers here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Various measures are being proposed, and they
                may be of some benefit. Some people can diversify — but only
                some. The farmers’ market initiative may help a few people —
                but only a few. Some of the major schemes which are supposed to
                benefit all farmers in Northern&nbsp;Ireland are not producing
                the goods. Dr&nbsp;Paisley was critical of the environmentalist
                lobby. I would be less so. There may be occasion when farmers
                will have to accept the fact that money which comes from agri-environment
                schemes may be the best way of maintaining incomes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us look at agri-environment schemes —
                for instance, the new rural development regulation. An excellent
                briefing paper from the Royal Society for the Protection of
                Birds and two farm unions points out that this year, farmers are
                losing £3·9&nbsp;million because of existing baselines and
                because the Department’s budget has not kept up with its
                commitments. Next year we will see some of the modulated
                European money coming through. Of the £7·7&nbsp;million which
                ought to be going to farms, £5·7&nbsp;million is being creamed
                off — and I have heard people use worse words than that — in
                Dundonald House, and only £2·0&nbsp;million (25%) is going
                where it was designed to go. That is barely a quarter of the
                money which should be going to farmers for essential agri-environment
                schemes to benefit the environment and farm incomes. If that is
                a measure of the Department’s, complacency we need answers
                from the Minister quickly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the fact that the Minister has
                talked about having meetings with the other UK Agriculture
                Ministers. That is one benefit of devolution. We can ensure that
                the interests we share with the Scots and Welsh are made known
                to Nick&nbsp;Brown so that he is aware that the UK fringes are
                heavily dependent on livestock and are subject to difficult
                conditions with regard to export markets.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also need to make sure that
                Nick&nbsp;Brown is told that no other country of the UK shares a
                land frontier with &quot;Euroland&quot;, with all the
                difficulties that that creates in terms of our economy compared
                to the Scots and the Welsh — whatever they are suffering. I
                was invited to visit some farms in mid-Wales last year, and,
                superficially, the similarities with the Sperrins or the Mournes
                are quite clear. Their farmers are certainly suffering as well.
                However, taking into account the issue of cross-border trade —
                or the lack of it — it is clear how much more suffering there
                is in Northern Ireland and how much greater the need for our
                Minister to make this clear to the Ministry of Agriculture,
                Fisheries and Food.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a major threat to our society. It is
                ludicrous to suggest that the future of rural areas in places
                like south Antrim or north Down is as a sort of commuter
                bungalow land, or in areas like the Mournes or Sperrins or the
                Fermanagh&nbsp;Lakes is as a weekend bungalow land. The only way
                we will maintain a viable society in rural areas is to maintain
                viable farms as the basis of those societies. Without those
                farms the businesses, the schools, the shops and the post
                offices will go, and we will be left with completely dead
                wasteland. That is the crisis we face unless the Minister takes
                action.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Roche:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Farming is the largest industry in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland. It accounts for 10% of employment and 8%
                of gross domestic product. The industry is in a serious crisis
                — total farm income fell by 22% last year, and over a
                five-year period the fall has been 80%. Together with the fall
                in income, the agriculture sector owes the banks approximately
                £520&nbsp;million — a veritable debt mountain. Over the last
                five years approximately £600&nbsp;million has been taken out
                of the local economy, and there has been an exodus from farming.
                Only about 7% of those currently involved in agriculture are
                under 35&nbsp;years of age.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The BSE crisis has virtually closed off our
                export markets, and the control measures, whatever their merits,
                introduced by the Government have imposed considerable costs on
                agriculture. An overwhelming case can be made for giving
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland special treatment in respect of both
                exports and compensation to make up for the costs incurred as a
                result of the control measures. Statistics show that for 1999
                the incidence of BSE per million head of adult cattle in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland was 14·2; in the Republic it was 22; and
                in Great Britain it was 513. This shows that
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland has had the lowest incidence of BSE and
                should be given low incidence-BSE status for export purposes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recognise the difficulties faced by the
                Minister. As a region in the UK, Northern Ireland does not have
                that status already because of the agriculture politics in the
                rest of the UK. We then have the greater problem of the politics
                in the EU which are putting the French in the position of trying
                to keep a total export ban on British beef.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another cause of the crisis is the weakness
                of the Euro. Our export prices are becoming uncompetitive, and
                the import prices are making it difficult for us to compete in
                our home market. All of this means that farm income in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland is at an historically low level. One
                immediate source of alleviation would be the agri-monetary
                compensation package for the year 2000, which is approximately
                £450&nbsp;million. Twenty&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent — about
                £88&nbsp;million — has been used, so there is
                £360&nbsp;million left for the rest or the year for the UK as a
                whole. As I understand it, that would give about
                £50&nbsp;million to agriculture in Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The farming community will have to take
                immediate steps to strengthen its position in the market with
                the supermarkets and food processors. It should not rely on the
                Government. An industry that relies on the Government has
                written the recipe for its own destruction.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The action taken by the Executive to date —rather,
                the inaction — demonstrates a total absence of any coherent
                policy or strategy to deal with this situation. Two&nbsp;weeks
                ago the First&nbsp;Minister announced that he had put a proposal
                for a £100&nbsp;million aid package for agriculture to the
                Prime Minister.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. The time is up.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Douglas:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. The House should
                realise the implications of the crisis in farming for the
                Province’s economy as a whole. Falling farm incomes are
                jeopardising the sustainability of farming, the countryside and
                the rural economy, and this inevitably will have Province-wide
                repercussions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By way of introduction, and to illustrate the
                severity of the situation, let me give an example. Dairy farming
                was for many years thought to be the best of farming
                enterprises, but the agriculture industry has reached such a
                crisis point that many dairy farmers, despite having
                100&nbsp;cows, are struggling to stay in business, and a lot of
                them are depending on family credit to put food on the table.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Make no mistake: the writing is on the wall
                for many farming families unless they are given a fair deal.
                Serious difficulties in the agricultural sector and in the rural
                economy have largely been the result of forces beyond their
                control. For example, agricultural fuel prices have almost
                doubled in the last year. Furthermore, the exchange rate —
                particularly the strength of sterling — affects the farming
                community in a way which cannot and should not be
                underestimated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The House should be mindful that since
                agriculture support measures and direct payments are in Euros,
                changes in sterling are applied almost immediately. Therefore
                both domestic and export prices are seriously affected by the
                strength of the pound sterling in the exchange rate. This is
                especially the case since a sizeable percentage of agricultural
                income is generated by exportation into Europe, and,
                consequently, the stronger the pound sterling, the less
                competitive are British products.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This, along with the BSE crisis, has meant
                that farmers find themselves in a great deal of debt with no
                conceivable means of repayment. Animals with little or no value
                will invariably become a liability, and so the farmers’
                financial situation continues in a downward spiral. This has
                led, as was mentioned earlier, to desperation and a sense of
                hopelessness which has driven many farmers to suicide.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is not to say that there has not been
                help. Much emphasis has recently been put on rural development
                through locally forged partnerships which are EU-funded. In
                short, this is not enough. Although some farmers at local level
                have benefited from receiving funding for innovative ideas, this
                type of initiative will not be sufficient to sustain and retain
                the majority of those who live in rural areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is all very well to praise rural dwellers
                and tell them that they are the custodians of the countryside,
                but mainstream farming should be profitable and maintained at a
                level where re-investment is possible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">British farmers are in a more difficult
                position than workers in any other sector in the
                United&nbsp;Kingdom, and the British Government have failed to
                compensate the agriculture industry during the last
                four&nbsp;years. The United&nbsp;Kingdom was notably the only
                member state of the European Union not to do so. The Labour
                Party manifesto in the last general election supported radical
                reform, but it has not delivered. The British Minister for
                Agriculture, Nick&nbsp;Brown, said that compensation to help
                farmers over the changes would be generous, but he has broken
                his word. Broken promises appear to be the only consistent
                factor in the new Labour Party policy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As has been mentioned, there has been
                speculation that the Prime Minister will inform representatives
                of the National Farmers’ Union that no financial help will be
                made available to farmers to see them through the present
                crisis. Furthermore, he thinks that they ought to diversify and
                seek alternative sources of income aside from the money required
                to speculate to accumulate. Were 533,000&nbsp;farmers to
                diversify, a crisis would be created in more sectors than one.
                The Agriculture Committee has encouraged the Minister of
                Agriculture and Rural Development to do all in her power to
                rectify this by lobbying in London.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I urge the Assembly to support the Minister,
                the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development and the
                National Farmers’ Union to work together to ensure that the
                full agri-money compensation which is due to the farming
                community and which was established to protect all European
                farmers is paid. I support the motion.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have heard and will continue to hear more
                and more statistics. These add to the gloom and difficulty being
                experienced by the agricultural economy that seems to be under
                attack from every quarter. There are difficulties that come from
                Europe; there is the inability of a British, so-called Labour
                Government to move away from the advocated <i>laissez-faire</i>
                economic culture; and there is the apathy which exists among the
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland public.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have seen the problems caused by companies
                who import every single item for their shops — not just a
                large percentage of their goods but every single item. I have
                been told that such a company has set up in Dungannon in spite
                of there being a hinterland full of suffering farmers. It does
                not matter whether they be sheep, pig, dairy or beef farmers,
                they are all trying to work the land and are struggling in
                economic difficulty.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What about helping ourselves? In the
                negotiations we had an opportunity to think about helping
                ourselves, yet we denied ourselves the ability to have
                tax-varying or tax-raising powers. This means that we now have
                the begging bowl out once again. We are holding out the begging
                bowl to Westminster and to Europe. Frankly, however, we are not
                doing very well because the laissez-faire economic culture is
                stronger in the hallowed halls of Westminster than any argument
                that we have yet made. And unless we are going to kick doors in
                at Westminster&nbsp;—</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Member accept that by revaluing the
                green pound we would not need to go anywhere with the begging
                bowl? That would help farmers in the UK at no cost to local
                taxpayers, although there would be a cost to the European
                Community but taking such action would bring funds to our
                farmers which all other farmers are getting.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ervine:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not disagree with the Member at all, but
                we need to look at the position we are in. The reason all these
                people are in the Galleries is that they hope that we can help
                them by delivering something better than what they currently
                have. Long-term ideas are all right, but if people are leaving
                the land and contemplating suicide, as we heard earlier, if
                difficulties and incomes are as bad as all that, we need to act
                now.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I come from an urban background, and the
                perception is that I have no concept of the difficulties of the
                agricultural community. We live in a country that is
                90&nbsp;miles long and 90&nbsp;miles wide, and its economy
                affects all of us. For that reason I say that the situation is
                intolerable. If people working on a factory floor were bringing
                home what those in agriculture are bringing home, there would be
                an outcry. No one — but no one — would tolerate it, yet not
                only do we tolerate it, but we go to the shops and purchase
                goods which are putting our people out of business. We should
                demand that shopkeepers stock at least a certain percentage of
                goods produced in Northern Ireland. It is all very well to say
                nice words, but we need to do something.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First Ministers and Deputy First Ministers
                are afraid to agitate because of European attitudes to free
                enterprise and open borders. However, it is perfectly reasonable
                for a trade union or a farmers’ union to agitate and to
                continue to agitate until the people of Northern&nbsp;Ireland
                know that until we can kick down doors in Europe and at
                Westminster and be listened to and answered, the only option we
                have is self-help. That is our only option at present.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If Members intend to tackle the distressing
                circumstances of the agricultural economy, they had better think
                about doing it very soon. We had better think of cross-party
                support for the people who are suffering. We had better think of
                ways to fund trips to Europe and of ensuring that we are in
                Westminster at every conceivable opportunity to make people take
                notice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a great deal of criticism of the
                French. I do not advocate that we go to the same lengths as the
                French do, whether they be truck drivers or farmers, but they
                sure as hell make their Government sit up and take notice. What
                do we do? We speak in platitudes; we say the farmers have our
                support, and meanwhile, back at the ranch, these people are
                continuing to suffer.</p>

                We recognise the crisis in the farming industry. Every Member
                who has spoken has talked of the soaring figures, of terrible
                debt, of children leaving farms and of the drastic cut of up to
                80% in farmers’ income. We are aware of it, and we recognise
                that it is drastic. This is not crying wolf; this is a genuine
                crisis. We can all see that. We give our full support to the
                appeal being made by farmers, by those gathered outside this
                building today, for what Dr&nbsp;Paisley has called an
                &quot;extraordinary&quot; approach to this crisis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why do farmers need our support? It is not
                merely a matter of jobs or individuals. We are faced with the
                possible death of our rural communities and traditions. It has
                been said here today that we must protect the social fabric of
                the rural economy. David&nbsp;Ford said that it is about post
                offices, banks and market towns — our rural economy and
                people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must protect them. Many a farmer would
                call me a city slicker, but this is not a matter of the
                rural-dweller versus the city dweller. We must not forget that
                when farm incomes are cut and the young men and women of farming
                families have to leave, this sparks rural depopulation, thus
                putting pressure on cities. Calls are made in towns and cities
                for the green belt to be protected. In spite of this, more
                accommodation is needed because rural areas are being
                depopulated. This is not a matter of country versus city. No
                matter where we live, all of us in Northern&nbsp;Ireland must
                recognise that the farming community has to he helped.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paddy&nbsp;Roche talked about the main
                causes, and I should like to dwell on these for a moment. There
                is no doubt that the two main causes are the fallout from the
                BSE crisis and the strength of sterling. I ask the Assembly and
                the farmers whose fault this is.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us turn to the BSE crisis. I know all
                about this, for I was involved in the European Commission at
                that time. The Government did not stick to the rules on BSE set
                down by Europe. They bent those rules and farmers are now being
                expected to accept responsibility for that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Who is to blame for the strength of sterling?
                It is not the fault of the farmers. What can they do? Perhaps we
                could look more seriously at allowing Northern&nbsp;Ireland to
                enter the Euro-zone as a pilot project. Perhaps farmers would
                support that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Neither of these problems is the fault of
                farmers. The Government must accept responsibility. We cannot
                accept Nick&nbsp;Brown or Tony&nbsp;Blair saying that farmers
                must diversify. We have heard about the golf courses and the
                bed-and-breakfast businesses. That is not good enough. We need a
                concerted approach to protecting the rural community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I should like to send a message of support to
                farmers and their families. I support this motion. As I close, I
                should like to remind the House of Dr&nbsp;Paisley’s words
                this morning. These farmers are</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must do something for them.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Everyone in the House is united on this
                issue. All the interesting and informative speeches have
                illustrated the grievous plight of the farming industry. They
                have explained in great detail the reasons for that plight. What
                are we going to do about it? It is all very well for each of us
                to say that the plight of the farmers is awful. The crisis
                exists, and the reasons for the crisis are the strength of
                sterling and BSE. That does nothing for the farmer, though it
                may exorcise the guilt we feel at our impotence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The truth is that this Assembly can do very
                little to alleviate the effects of the farming crisis, which is
                due to many circumstances totally beyond our control. Perhaps
                the best statement made was on what the people of
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland can do for themselves. It is true to say
                that any industry, including the farming industry, which relies
                on the munificence of the Government for its future is on a
                hiding to nothing. What we can do is focus the attention of the
                entire community on the fact that if it does not support its own
                producers then it is unlikely that anyone else will. Interposed
                between the consumer and the farmer is the retailer. The
                retailing industry in Northern&nbsp;Ireland has been transformed
                over recent years by the introduction of the multi-national
                supermarket chains. They came here when things were getting
                better. They supplanted the local traders who had kept business
                going throughout 30&nbsp;years of internecine warfare in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland, but the introduction of the large
                supermarkets has laid waste to a great many small traders in a
                number of small towns.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The real question is: what can we do to
                ensure, insofar as it is possible, that those retailers support
                the produce of the people from whom they are extracting their
                profit? Anyone who goes into Tescos or Sainsbury’s should know
                that it is acknowledged throughout Europe generally that the
                major food chains in the United&nbsp;Kingdom are making far
                higher profits than their counterparts in Europe, and they are
                making those profits largely at the expense of the producers.
                They go through the fraud of labelling their goods &quot;Sourced
                in Northern&nbsp;Ireland&quot; — not &quot;Produced in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland&quot; — but &quot;Sourced in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland&quot;. That covers a multitude of sins,
                including purchasing from agents who are in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland but who source their produce from abroad.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If this Assembly can do one thing, it can
                alert the electorate to the fact that if they do not support
                their own farmers and buy produce clearly labelled as being
                produced by farmers in Northern&nbsp;Ireland, then they are
                destroying a large part of their own economy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In broad terms, Europe does what suits the
                major members of the European Commission. They can forget about
                the fines that were levied on Italy for milk quota frauds. They
                can turn a blind eye to Spain injecting capital directly into
                Iberia&nbsp;Airlines. They can do whatever they want, and unless
                we ensure that we back our own people then, as some of the
                Members have said, Northern&nbsp;Ireland will be turned into a
                farming waste land. Golf courses and other leisure amenities
                will dominate the countryside, but the farmer will be destroyed.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Armstrong:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is good to see some familiar faces from
                the farming community in the Galleries today. I know that it is
                not every farmer who can afford to leave his livestock for a few
                hours to attend rallies and listen to debates in the Assembly. I
                recognise the sterling work done by Will&nbsp;Taylor and
                Douglas&nbsp;Roe of the Ulster Farmers’ Union.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Agriculture is the largest single industry in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland. However, figures released yesterday show
                that total farming income has fallen by 79% since 1995 — an
                astounding statistic. Farmers in less favoured areas are
                realising an average annual income of £179. Our farmers now owe
                approximately £523&nbsp;million to banks, and this figure
                continues to increase. Farm incomes in Northern&nbsp;Ireland
                decreased by 22% in 1999, compared to an estimated 1% in the UK
                as a whole. We can clearly see that Northern&nbsp;Irish
                agriculture does not get a high priority with the UK Government,
                and we cannot let this situation continue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Approximately 60,000&nbsp;people are employed
                in this vital industry. Since £572&nbsp;million has been
                removed from Northern&nbsp;Ireland’s economy over the last
                five years, it must be brought home to the Government that
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland is no less important than any other
                region. Other parts of the UK are more industrialised, and
                agriculture is less important to them. The Government do not
                value this industry or consider it worth saving. Other major
                industries receive financial help in times of crisis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland has always had high health
                and welfare standards, dating back to the days before the EC. We
                had stringent legislation on the importing of agricultural
                products. When we became part of the European free market,
                products of lower quality came into Northern&nbsp;Ireland. We
                are well known for our excellent traceability records and
                distinguished levels of health, welfare and efficiency, as well
                as for the high genetic value of our livestock.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland farmers have complied with
                all the EU legislation on health and welfare standards. They
                were promised a premium for their products, only to find
                inferior products from other parts of Europe on our supermarket
                shelves. Fancy packages and low prices seem to appeal more to
                the consumer. Premium prices were not realised, and all hopes of
                recovering the money invested have been dashed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Furthermore, UK companies have imported
                certain products whose health and welfare standards do not match
                our high standards, and that has created unfair competition.
                These products have also been cheaper. In Northern&nbsp;Ireland
                we had only six cases of BSE in 1999. France recognised about
                30&nbsp;cases in 1999. We had only 27&nbsp;cases in 1997, yet
                the French refuse to buy British beef. It is totally unfair that
                our high-quality products cannot be exported across Europe. It
                is time that we were treated as a low incidence area for BSE.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are all aware of Holland’s lucrative
                market for bull calves. As an exporting area, it has been very
                important and beneficial to us to export products that are in
                short supply in other countries. At present, these calves are
                worth £70 to £100 in the Irish&nbsp;Republic and are being
                exported from there to Europe. It could be said that there are
                more cases of BSE in the Irish&nbsp;Republic.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am particularly concerned about our pig
                farmers. They have not been able to cover their costs for the
                last 20&nbsp;months. Many face debts of £200,000; some owe as
                much as £500,000 to the banks and meal companies. None of the
                Government bodies seems to want to do anything to alleviate this
                problem. The importing of pork and bacon products which are of a
                lower standard than similar products produced in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland should be discontinued. There should be a
                level playing field.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister met some young farmers in my
                constituency three&nbsp;weeks ago. The farmers revealed their
                private, painful stories and personal bank statements.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As has already been said, all parties in the
                House will support the farming community in this emergency. I
                fear that the fact that it is an emergency has not been
                communicated properly to the community. I can repeat, as can
                every other Member, the horrendous statistics on the fall in
                incomes, the lack of revenue and the higher costs which have
                been reproduced for the first time, almost coincidentally,
                throughout all sectors of the community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Political representatives and representatives
                of farmers’ unions have failed to convey the enormity of the
                situation to the general public — the consumers. First, as
                Mr&nbsp;Roche has said, farming is a base industry involving 10%
                of the civil population and accounting for 8% of GDP. What other
                country would allow that volume of industry to be sacrificed?
                Secondly, the farming community is the custodian of our
                heritage, rural communities, land and environment. Are we going
                to jettison those as well? The problem is that the same criteria
                are being applied to Northern Ireland’s agriculture as are
                being applied to agriculture in the UK, where it is not an
                important economic factor — and Members need to face this. The
                Government’s response reflects that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In some respects that is why we have failed
                to inform the European conscience of our drastic situation. Our
                local Minister and the Department of Agriculture and Rural
                Development must put pressure on Whitehall to insist that the
                national Government take this issue seriously and save this base
                industry by a special dispensation or arrangement within the EU
                to reflect our special circumstances. That must happen as a
                matter of urgency. Europe knows that this is a huge problem. The
                recent Eurostat report indicates quite clearly that
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland incomes, and indeed UK incomes as a whole,
                fell dramatically in the years from 1995 to 1998. Europe knows
                this from its own statistics, so it really is time to &quot;kick
                in that door&quot;, as one Member so elegantly put it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no point in Members debating the
                statistics, horrendous though they may be. The forecast for
                1999-2000 is of net loss to farming incomes throughout the
                community. Members, and the farming community, cannot tolerate
                that. The community can tolerate loss for only one or two years
                at most. The rescue package must then be in place to help the
                community out of that morass and into prosperity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members should not adopt the pessimistic
                attitude that nothing can be done. Similarly, the repetition of
                statistics will not energise us. We must make suggestions. There
                should be special arrangements in Europe to address a special
                problem. Other national Governments can do it, so our national
                Government should also be able to do it. The agri-monetary
                compensation must be claimed and released to farmers in
                proportion to their requirements, particularly in this region.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The reassessment of the green pound has
                already been mentioned, and that should be done. At home, the
                financial institutions, which are servicing the
                £520&nbsp;million deficit must give special consideration to
                farmers. For decades, the high street banks have ridden on the
                gravy train thanks to the Agriculture and other industries; now
                it is their turn to feel some pain as well. Arrangements to
                rescue the farmers need to be agreed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Restructuring may be required. The
                agricultural retirement scheme, which is available in the
                Republic of Ireland, must be made available here to allow good
                economic restructuring to take place. I would like to see a task
                force established immediately in Northern&nbsp;Ireland involving
                representatives from the relevant Government Departments:
                Agriculture and Rural Development; Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment; Health, Social Services and Public Safety; and
                Environment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It should urgently investigate this issue on
                a cross-departmental basis and produce a plan to alleviate the
                problems. Merely tinkering with the problem of diversification
                or environmental improvements will not help. We must be more
                dramatic in our approach.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not intend to concentrate on the
                agriculture industry’s problems — they have been well
                covered already. We are all aware of the £520&nbsp;million
                farming debt and the fact that only 7% of farmers are under the
                age of 35. What we need are solutions. The
                Permanent&nbsp;Secretary is in the House, and although we do not
                know what the future of the Assembly will be he will still hold
                his position whether Alf&nbsp;Dubs or Bríd&nbsp;Rodgers is the
                Minister. There is more responsibility on the
                Permanent&nbsp;Secretary’s shoulders than on anybody else’s.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Agriculture and Rural
                Development needs a radical shake-up. Farmers have had
                regulations imposed on them over the years, regulations that
                have been implemented and policed by the Department, yet the
                same Department has not managed to deliver a full lifting of the
                BSE ban. We need to see that we get low-incidence status
                quickly. Is it right that the Irish Republic, which has many
                more cases of BSE than Northern&nbsp;Ireland, can export calves
                and get £130&nbsp;per head when farmers from
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland have to pay to get their calves
                slaughtered? How can France continue to export beef when they
                have more incidences of BSE than Northern&nbsp;Ireland? It is
                time that the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development
                put the case of the Northern&nbsp;Ireland farmers to Brussels
                and Strasbourg. Farmers have applied all the regulations; now it
                is time for the Department to deliver.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The European sheep meat regime should also be
                looked at. Has the Department ever asked Brussels to look at it?
                The Government in the Irish Republic have asked for the regime
                to be changed. Last week, it was announced that sheep farmers
                are to get an annual subsidy of £13·48. Given that lamb prices
                are lower than they have been for five&nbsp;years, I would have
                expected that that subsidy would have been over £20. However,
                because the system under which the sheep meat regime operates is
                unjust, we are given less compensation than we should.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need a strong implementation of policy on
                the importation of potatoes. Northern&nbsp;Ireland is presently
                importing potatoes that are of a lower standard than those
                produced here. Disease standards are not being maintained. The
                imported potatoes are not subject to the same standard scrutiny
                for brown rot disease as is applied to Northern&nbsp;Ireland
                potatoes. There is a danger that this disease could be brought
                into Northern&nbsp;Ireland and ruin the local potato industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department has handed out money in FEOGA
                grants to two firms to expand their potato marketing operation.
                They have imported thousands of tonnes of potatoes from Scotland
                and Europe, and this has driven down the price of potatoes in
                the Province. Farmers now have to sell potatoes at £20&nbsp;per
                tonne, because the Government have paid for these firms to build
                cold stores. It is not the Department’s role to improve the
                marketing conditions of firms in Northern Ireland; its role is
                to improve the marketing conditions for farmers in general.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department must get its act together and
                work on behalf of the Northern&nbsp;Ireland farmers. Time and
                time again new regulations are introduced. I can recall the
                introduction of the Maedi-Visna regulations. There was no a need
                for those regulations to be introduced, but, as there were
                obviously surplus staff in the Department’s veterinary
                service, this was a good way to keep them occupied. We are
                spending more on the administration of agriculture than farmers
                make in profit. It is time for the Department to get its act
                together. The farmers are doing their bit. No more regulations
                should be imposed on them, for they cannot afford to implement
                the regulations. The Department should go to Brussels and fight
                the Northern&nbsp;Ireland farmers’ case. There is no point in
                blaming others; the main reason for our problems is the
                Department’s inadequate representation of the farmers’ case.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr J Kelly:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh. Like my
                Colleague Gerry&nbsp;McHugh, I support the motion. At the
                outset, Mr&nbsp;Speaker, I would like to say that the philosophy
                of &quot;ourselves alone&quot; has been well ventilated this
                morning, so I will not dwell on it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The crisis in the agriculture industry is
                very real — not for me, but for the farmers and their families
                who are suffering as a result of it. I welcome the farmers and
                their families who are here this morning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much has been made of the connection between
                the North and the South. I am not trying to make a political
                point, but had the agriculture industry in Ireland acted as a
                single unit, 10, 15 or even 20&nbsp;years ago, then the present
                agriculture crisis would not be as severe as it is. One has only
                to look at the agriculture industry in the Free State to know
                that they milked the system, very astutely and acutely, while we
                were tied in to British agricultural policy within the EU.
                Consequently, the only people who suffered were the farmers of
                the North of Ireland. Had we gone forthrightly into the
                agriculture sector in Europe as a single unit, then we would not
                be facing the crisis that we face today — or at least it would
                not be as bad. Agriculture is in crisis universally, but I
                believe that we would not be facing the crisis that we are
                facing had we acted as a single unit.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to turn to the schemes that were
                inaugurated to help farmers — the ESA scheme in particular.
                Prior to Christmas, I was inundated with calls from farmers who
                had still not received their ESA payments. These were due in
                August, and by December they still had not been paid. It was the
                people on small farms who were suffering. They needed the money
                not only to buy fodder, but to run their homes. When one of them
                rang the Department he was told that the payments had not been
                made because the computers were down. So there is a new excuse
                being given now. It is no longer &quot;The cheque is in the
                post&quot;; it is &quot;The computers are down&quot;. That was
                the excuse given. Those schemes need to be seriously and
                rigorously looked at to ensure that if farmers are participating
                in such schemes they are paid the amount of money that has been
                guaranteed to them — and on time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The situation in respect of rural planning is
                a disgrace, and something must be done about it. Time after time
                the Department refuses planning permission to the sons and
                daughters of farmers who are seeking to develop their own land,
                because this does not fit into the environment. What other
                environment is it going to fit into? They are living in the
                country. Is it spoiling the countryside? What is the real
                reason? I accept that there must be planning controls, but those
                controls should not be so rigorously applied in relation to
                rural planning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Additionally, when a farmer who has a small
                piece of useless ground seeks planning permission for it in
                order to sell it — there is nothing wrong with that, because
                the land is useless, and he is looking for some other form of
                income — he is refused. That is an issue that needs to be
                looked into urgently.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Colleague and others have mentioned the
                issue of consumers paying top prices for bacon, beef, lamb,
                poultry and other agricultural produce while producers receive
                the lowest prices. Someone, somewhere has to put in place a
                mechanism which investigates this, and one which puts some
                controls on the prices that consumers are paying as compared
                with the money that producers are receiving. Realistically these
                are things which should be looked at now, and a way should be
                found to alleviate the problems that exist in the farming
                community in the short term.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To link the agricultural crisis with the
                present political crisis is a crass piece of political
                opportunism. We are talking here about an industry that is in
                crisis. We are talking about a whole population that is in
                crisis and a countryside that has been denuded of its
                population. We should be trying to address life-support measures
                — and addressing them seriously — not trying to make a
                political point.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Leslie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When addressing problems in the agriculture
                sector we must do so in the context that it is, in most
                respects, the last-state controlled industry. The snag is that
                it is not state-owned, and therefore the state is not
                responsible for the wages or costs of the industry. But the
                state controls the output prices by way of a mixture of policy,
                action, inaction and the subsidy process. The common
                agricultural policy has essentially distorted the market in
                agricultural produce, and not always to our disadvantage.
                Sometimes the markets have been distorted to the farmers’advantage,
                and the subsidy system tries to correct that, but it distorts
                the market further.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the Agenda&nbsp;2000 proposals were
                originally produced they were flagged up as being an attempt to
                address these distortions and gradually restructure the industry
                to make it more responsive to market forces. Unfortunately, such
                an outcome did not emerge from the negotiations this time
                around. While there was some short-term relief, I question
                whether there will be a long-term benefit. A House of Lords
                Select Committee looked at the problems in the agriculture
                sector and said</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;If the long-term prospect of adjustment
                to globally competitive agriculture is not to cause great and
                prolonged hardship, it is critical that the reorientation of the
                industry to a position where it can compete successfully is
                commenced as soon as possible. If not, change may be thrust upon
                the industry at an unnecessarily painful pace.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It seems that we are in the latter scenario.
                It is a great pity that the expertise that was available when
                the report was made is no longer available to the House of
                Lords.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Treasury is no friend of the common
                agricultural policy, which consumes over half of the total
                European Union budget. As the United&nbsp;Kingdom is a net
                contributor to that budget, the only way it can see its net
                contributions falling is if it can reduce expenditure on the
                common agricultural policy. Therefore the interests of the
                Treasury are completely contrary to those of the farmer.
                Unfortunately, the Treasury is much more powerful.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I urge the Minister to address the
                restructuring of the industry to see what the Department can do
                to help this process. She should also address the
                £45&nbsp;million of the Department’s budget, which is
                flexible and which relates to teaching, advisory and technical
                services. We are turning out very competent farmers, but we may
                have made them competent in a sphere from which they cannot make
                money. I urge the Minister to see whether the curriculum is able
                to produce the right skills for the market into which
                agriculture is moving.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The words &quot;restructuring&quot; and
                &quot;diversify&quot; are used too loosely. There are some
                opportunities, but it is hard to see that there will be enough
                for everyone. I welcome the Culture, Arts and Leisure Committee’s
                intention to look into freshwater fishing. Farmers fortunate
                enough to have land along a river bank might want to turn to
                that as a possible source of future revenue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I mentioned earlier that farming is
                essentially the last nationalised industry. When the steel
                industry, the car industry, and the coal industry were
                restructured and returned to the private sector the Government
                provided a very considerable cushion for the workforce. The
                situation is analogous to agriculture, but because farmers are
                self-employed, there is no onus on the Government to provide any
                such cushion. The Government should look very carefully at their
                duties in this regard, because they control much of the output
                price, and that is what governs the success of the industry.
                That is why Mr&nbsp;Savage presented his &quot;soft loan&quot;
                scheme — not to subsidise farmers, but to help soften the
                process of change. The Government must also provide a cushion
                and an incentive for the farming industry.</p>
                <b>

                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gallagher:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The farming industry needs practical and
                financial support, and it needs it now. Otherwise the family
                farming tradition, so typical of Northern&nbsp;Ireland, will
                fade away, and we will have other consequences to contend with.
                Members know that, owing to the fall in farming prices, this
                crisis impacts on the wider community. Farmers have less
                disposable income.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the last three&nbsp;years more than
                £100&nbsp;million has been lost to the local economy as a
                result of this crisis. It is causing particular difficulty in my
                constituency of Fermanagh and South&nbsp;Tyrone, as farming has
                always been a more difficult enterprise there because of the
                climate and the soil. Indeed, 30% of the County&nbsp;Fermanagh
                workforce is involved in agriculture. Members will agree that
                that is a much higher percentage than in any other part of
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the UK, the average percentage of the
                workforce involved in agriculture is a mere 2%. We have a large
                number of small farms and a small number of large farms. Farm
                incomes are measured in terms of standard gross margin (SGM).
                The SGM for farmers in County Fermanagh is 14·7, in County
                Antrim 25·5, and in County Down 22·3. But all farming
                communities need alternative employment opportunities and
                part-time employment opportunities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend the Minister for beginning to put
                in place a new strategy for agriculture and rural development. I
                reject what Mr&nbsp;Roche said with regard to the present
                Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development and her record.
                He was talking nonsense. The Minister needs the support of the
                Executive and she needs to link in to other Departments in order
                to provide more opportunities for those who run our farming
                industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Until now, worthwhile ideas coming from the
                farming community have had little encouragement from the
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland Tourist Board. Look at the importance of
                tourism in Fermanagh and the importance of good co-operation
                between the farming community and those promoting tourism.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another employment agency responsible for
                small businesses is LEDU. Why have better links not been
                developed between LEDU and the farming community? Why have some
                of the good ideas for enterprises on farms not had LEDU’s
                support? This needs further investigation by the Executive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has already been said that rural planning
                policy is a major obstacle. However, it is not just in relation
                to housing, as my Colleague John&nbsp;Kelly said. Any farmer who
                wants to embark on a new enterprise runs into an obstacle right
                away when he seeks planning permission in rural areas. He is
                invariably told it cannot be done.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister and the Executive can iron out
                many of these problems. Both anti-agreement and pro-agreement
                Members will have failed to live up to their responsibilities
                under the agreement if there is a return to direct rule, for our
                farmers will suffer more than they have ever done.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have listened with care to the debate so
                far, and we have all heard the Prime Minister say that he is
                going to tell farmers that they will have to diversify, but I do
                not know how many of them are going to be able to diversify.
                Many will be bankrupt, so what are they going to diversify with?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Farmers want to farm their land; that is what
                they were brought up to do, and they should be able to get on
                with it. They understand the problems of other sectors of
                industry. Take, for example, the textile industry. Many farmers’
                families are also feeling the pinch there, because many of their
                children have worked in the textile firms that are closing down.
                The farming industry in this Province is haemorrhaging
                seriously, and the Department is seeking to put a sticking
                plaster over the problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The crisis in pig farming has been going on
                for many months. We do not have to gather the facts; they are
                already there. If officials in the Department do not know the
                facts about the pig industry, something is seriously wrong, and
                it is about time that they vacated their positions and let
                others take over. We have to take this matter to where it really
                counts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the midst of this crisis I am sick, sore
                and tired of hearing from one person after another that there is
                nothing they can do. With the greatest respect to the Minister,
                I know she did not make the problem, but she now has the
                responsibility for handling it — we do not need the parroting
                of official lines. All we hear is that there is nothing that
                Europe allows the Minister to do. Why can nothing be done? What
                are the French doing? Are they not supposed to be the great
                Europeans? They are saving their farming industry. They are
                pouring money into it, and they will save their pig and other
                sectors. Of course, we hold up our hands and self-righteously
                say &quot;There is nothing that Europe will allow us to
                do.&quot; That is absolutely disgusting.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We do not have just the strong pound problem,
                the BSE problem, the offal payments, the differential in meal,
                electricity and water costs; we also have the unfair
                differential between the price our farmers get for their
                products and what others get in the remainder of the
                United&nbsp;Kingdom. We are fed up with people telling us that
                there is nothing they can do. There must be a financial package
                for this. Farmers are going to be totally bankrupt. Many of them
                have gone as far as they can possibly go, and all we are saying
                to them is that there is nothing we can do.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I heard it said today that tax-raising powers
                would be the answer. Whenever there is a problem and a factory
                is being closed, are taxes raised to bring in the money? Not at
                all; money is sought from the Exchequer. Gordon&nbsp;Brown’s
                Exchequer is filled with money ready for a general election —
                they have to hand out the goodies and buy people off at election
                time. The money is there — you do not have to raise taxes to
                get the money; the money is already in the coffers. The problem
                is this: they are unwilling to cover pound for pound, and the
                farmers are going down. It may seem funny to some people, but I
                have had farmer after farmer sitting in my constituency office
                crying about his situation, and no one is willing to do anything
                about it. The Minister should go to Europe and say that we were
                told that everyone was dying to help us in Ulster because we
                have this Assembly going. Let them put their money where their
                mouths are. Let them prove themselves by backing us and allowing
                farmers to survive instead of going under.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Gordon&nbsp;Brown told us that he was
                urgently looking at offal charges, that he was willing to back
                us and that he believed that he could do something about them.
                Farmers were given the same answer, but we are still awaiting
                his help.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What about the special BSE status?
                Nick&nbsp;Brown said that he would back our Minister if a
                presentation were made. My party leader, representatives from
                the SDLP and the Ulster Unionist Party and I were told by
                Nick&nbsp;Brown that he would instruct his officials to work
                with our officials to get that presentation.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Chathaoirligh, go raibh maith agat. I agree
                with the motion, and I support it. It is important to recognise
                that there is a crisis in the entire industry. I agree with
                Dr&nbsp;Paisley that the British&nbsp;Prime&nbsp;Minister’s
                call for people to diversify is not the answer. It may be the
                answer for some, but not for everyone. What would they diversity
                into? Where will the money come from? Is the Prime&nbsp;Minister
                prepared to ensure that the money going into industry will be
                transferred to agriculture? Will he make sure there is money
                available for farmers who want to diversify and that they will
                get the planning permission, which Mr&nbsp;Gallagher talked
                about, to set up an industry in the rural community?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Farmers want to be on the farm, and they want
                to be producers. To most farmers diversification into some other
                industry of which they have no experience is not an option.
                Diversification, if it is to take place, will have to be into
                something associated with land and farming.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main problem — and I am not making a
                political point — is that we in the Six&nbsp;Counties are
                linked to Britain. Britain is an industrial country, and it does
                not have any great interest in agriculture. It has an industrial
                base, which it wants to preserve. Britain has not made the case
                for our farmers in Europe, as was best illustrated during the
                BSE crisis when they failed to represent farmers. It is
                important to recognise that we will have to work within our own
                base. No one else will speak on our behalf.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Dr&nbsp;Paisley said, we need to make the
                link with those who have exploited Europe to the full — the
                Twenty-six County Government. They have shown how to get the
                most out of Europe — by putting the least in, as some people
                would say. We must ensure that the Irish&nbsp;Government, as a
                European Member, produces and markets Irish goods, whether they
                are from the North or from the South. We should be asking the
                Irish&nbsp;Government to do more to ensure that that happens. It
                can be achieved within the North/South Ministerial Council in
                the form of a common agricultural policy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many farmers in border areas have paid a very
                heavy price because of currency differences. We need to ensure
                that this does not happen. Currency differential affects not
                just the border areas and farmers but also imports and exports.
                The fact that Britain is not part of the European single
                currency has had a detrimental affect on farmers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All aspects of farming are now affected. In
                the beginning the problem may have been BSE and the beef crisis,
                but it is now expanding across the farm spectrum. Beef farmers,
                milk producers, pig producers, sheep farmers, potato growers and
                now mushroom growers are all affected. The fact that mushrooms
                are being imported from Europe and beyond is flooding the
                market, causing the price to drop. Cheap poultry imports will
                mean that another part of the industry will begin to fail. A
                situation similar to that which is happening in relation to the
                meat plant in Dungannon will occur. Imports will come in, and
                nothing will be produced here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have the basis for resolving this matter.
                We are paying the price for European membership. We have been
                part of the European Community but with our hands tied behind
                our backs. Because we are linked to an industrial nation we have
                not been able to exploit membership in the way other countries
                have. We need to make a link with a nation that is agricultural
                so that we can start to make agriculture work as they have done
                in the Twenty-six Counties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also need to remind ourselves that not all
                the money in the Twenty-six Counties went to the farmers. A lot
                of it went to meat plants and various associated bodies, and
                some of it went astray. Meat plants should put back into
                agriculture some of the money they have benefited from.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we are serious about reversing the
                situation we must do something about it. We need to pull
                together a common agricultural policy for the island of Ireland,
                not just for Europe.</p>

                time allocated to the motion be extended? A number of Members
                wish to speak, and if the time were extended by
                half&nbsp;an&nbsp;hour most of them would be able to do so.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I regret that it is not possible to do that.
                First, half an hour would not cover it. The Business Committee
                made the decision about the amount of time which was available,
                and it was clear. However, the Member is correct, and I was
                going to say this in any case before the Minister spoke. A
                substantial number of other Members have indicated their desire
                to speak and undoubtedly have made preparations to do so, but I
                regret that it will not be possible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members must understand that we have further
                business today which is also time-limited and which is urgent.
                It is important that those in the Assembly — as well as people
                outside — know that many other Members wished to speak in this
                debate but were unable to do so because of time constraints.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hussey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This crisis&nbsp;— and it is well defined
                as such — has been thoroughly debated in this Chamber. The
                fact that £600&nbsp;million has been lost to the economy over
                the last five&nbsp;years speaks for itself.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Roche highlighted the importance of
                the wider industry — the agri-food industry — to
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland. It accounts for 10% of all civil
                employment and 8% of gross domestic product, and it is
                three&nbsp;times more important in Northern&nbsp;Ireland than in
                the United&nbsp;Kingdom overall. Therein lies some indication of
                where our central Government are coming from.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1997 a farm income averaged at a mere
                £3,093. I dread to think what the situation is now. At that
                time 38% of farms were showing a loss. What is the percentage
                today?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr&nbsp;Paisley highlighted the amount of
                money that farmers owe to banks, feed suppliers and
                hire-purchase companies. If these companies had any sense of
                generosity or gave any thought to where their past profits came
                from, they would offer assistance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This crisis affects all sectors of the
                industry: pigs, sheep, poultry, milk, beef — the list goes on.
                Farmers have been left to defend an industry that is worth
                millions to the economy. What have Departments done in the past?
                They have followed United&nbsp;Kingdom policy. If the Assembly
                is to mean anything the Minister of Agriculture and Rural
                Development must adopt a Northern&nbsp;Ireland policy — one
                that truly reflects our needs. It is only a matter of time
                before there is a chain reaction to this crisis, and it will
                expand beyond the rural community to affect the high streets of
                villages, towns and cities throughout Northern&nbsp;Ireland.
                This crisis will impinge on us all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Despite all of this it is obvious to me that
                there remains a deliberate Labour Government policy of
                non-involvement in the agriculture industry. The crisis
                continues to deepen, and the Government must take exceptional
                measures. Central government must identify genuine and
                meaningful solutions — not the response given by the Prime
                Minister that has been well castigated by other Members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is time to introduce a differential
                low-risk BSE status for Northern&nbsp;Ireland. It is
                well-documented that the Republic and Great&nbsp;Britain have
                both had a much higher incidence of BSE than
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland. This was reported in ‘The&nbsp;Irish&nbsp;Times’
                today.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The traceability scheme which is in place in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland means that our produce is the best
                authenticated in the world — a fact that has not been properly
                recognised or promoted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government have made some mistakes in the
                past at great cost to the industry. Think of their decision to
                discontinue the calf processing aid scheme. That was wrong.
                William&nbsp;McCrea quite rightly highlighted the non-use of
                finances and the agri-monetary compensation which could be
                introduced. Mr&nbsp;McGrady mentioned the agricultural
                retirement scheme, and there are many other possibilities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are also wider issues: the millennium
                trade round, which takes over from the Uruguay trade round; the
                European model of agriculture, which will be under attack at
                World Trade Organisation discussions; disparity in the
                implementation of animal welfare legislation; the strength of
                sterling; the inexplicable differences between prices on the
                farms and those at shop counters; the lack of proper labelling
                — the list goes on.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Give our farmers a level playing field, and
                they will be able to compete with anyone.</p>

                contributions and to apologise in advance for the fact that I
                shall be unable to respond to every point today. Outstanding
                issues will be dealt with in writing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand the anger of Members and the
                farming communities, and I understand why they are having a
                peaceful protest today. They have the right to engage in
                peaceful protest, and I welcome their action.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have arranged to meet a delegation of
                farmers and their wives after this debate. I note that Members
                spoke of the men in the farming community, but I am very well
                aware that many women also work there in support of their
                husbands and on the farms as well. This is a people industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have great sympathy with the farming
                community. Since taking over as Minister of Agriculture and
                Rural Development I have become very aware of the huge decline
                in their incomes in recent years. This is why I have been
                working so hard in the Assembly and in London and Brussels to
                achieve something on their behalf.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The income figures released yesterday were a
                result of circumstances beyond my control, beyond the control of
                the Executive and, I stress, beyond the control of my
                Department, which has been unfairly criticised today for not
                doing enough and not caring. That is not true. I am impressed by
                the caring attitude that the officials in my Department display
                towards the farming community for whom they are working, as I
                am, in very difficult circumstances and with all of the
                constraints of the European regulations and the financial
                implications that surround us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The strength of sterling, world markets and
                other factors have been referred to by many people. I am
                conscious of the burden that I carry in representing the
                farmers, and I intend to do everything in my power to help them
                — and I stress &quot;in my power&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr&nbsp;McCrea said that I should let someone
                else take over if I am not able to do the job. We all enjoyed
                his rhetoric. He is good at that. We also note, however, that
                although there was an opportunity for someone else to take over
                responsibility for this industry, Rev Dr&nbsp;McCrea’s party
                decided not to take on that very difficult challenge.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But I am not afraid of challenges, and I will
                do my best in the circumstances in which I find myself. However,
                I do not like to be preached at by people who tell me that I
                could do better and should do better but who were not prepared
                to do the job themselves.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not going to have time to deal with
                every issue, but the Executive and I are doing everything that
                we can. The fact that we recently put £6·7&nbsp;million of the
                reallocated money towards making up for the budgetary shortfalls
                of my Department is an indication of our commitment to helping
                the farming community. In spite of some ill-informed commentary,
                both at that time and since, the vast majority of that money has
                gone to the farmers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was in Brussels last week lobbying
                Commissioner Fischler on behalf of Northern&nbsp;Ireland pig
                farmers. I have also had meetings with Nick&nbsp;Brown. I am
                told that, in his speech today in London, the
                Prime&nbsp;Minister said</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;In areas such as the pig industry,
                which is the most parlous at the moment, I do not rule out
                further measures to help. It must, however, be linked to a
                strategy which provides a long-term framework.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome that statement. I am, however, both
                anxious and interested to know what he has in mind. I hope to
                have a meeting with Nick&nbsp;Brown very shortly, and I shall
                certainly be anxious to hear about this and discuss it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members have referred to the agri-monetary
                compensation available to the UK which has not been paid, and I
                know that the Ulster Farmers’ Union has briefed some Members
                on this. The matter has been raised by Mr&nbsp;Savage,
                Dr&nbsp;Paisley, Dr&nbsp;McCrea, Mr&nbsp;Hussey and others. I
                agree in principle that moneys available to farmers should be
                paid to them. It is wrong that our farmers should suffer because
                of fiscal policies developed for other reasons. These policies
                should not put UK farmers at a disadvantage in comparison with
                those in other member states.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern&nbsp;Ireland farmers, as other
                Members have pointed out, are doubly disadvantaged, as they
                share a land border with the Republic. I have demanded an urgent
                meeting with Nick&nbsp;Brown to discuss agri-monetary payments.
                I do, however, recognise that he is constrained. I do not
                underestimate the resistance from the Treasury, but I would like
                some other Members of the House to assist me as I do my best to
                make the case for Northern&nbsp;Ireland pig farmers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall briefly refer to some of the points
                made before I go on. I am very aware that I shall not have time
                to do everything. Dr&nbsp;Paisley raised the question of help
                for new entrants. There is provision in the rural development
                plan for new entrants. It is one of the optional schemes, and we
                shall look at it. I shall deal with all of these matters in
                consultation with both the Agriculture Committee and the
                industry itself, which I have consulted many times already
                during the past two&nbsp;months.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Paisley has made comparisons with the
                Republic of Ireland on European money. These are false
                comparisons, since the Republic is not under the same financial
                constraints that we are, and whether we like it or not, we must
                operate under UK&nbsp;financial arrangements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have every reason to suspect that
                Dr&nbsp;Paisley and, indeed, Mr&nbsp;Poots, who raised the same
                issue, are not suggesting a more radical solution to our
                problems.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Stop bringing politics into it.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am merely making a point, and I think that
                it is a fair point.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have been to Brussels, and I have left
                Commissioner Fischler in no doubt about the problems in our pig
                sector. I have further meetings planned with Commissioner Byrne
                and him, and I am meeting the chief&nbsp;executive of Malton’s
                later this week. I shall also be meeting retailers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although Mr&nbsp;McCartney is no longer here,
                I shall respond to his point. I am aware of the problem of local
                sourcing. Mr&nbsp;Savage made the same point, which is of great
                importance. As I have said, I shall be meeting retailers and
                impressing upon them the need to source locally and to recognise
                that our pork is produced under conditions conducive to animal
                welfare. Indeed, I have written to all public-sector purchasing
                bodies in Northern&nbsp;Ireland making the same points. Together
                with Joe&nbsp;Walsh in the Republic, I have set up an
                investigation into pig-processing capacity on the island of
                Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also welcome and support what
                Mr&nbsp;McCartney said about local people supporting local
                produce. The £400,000 which has been made available for
                pig-meat marketing will be a help in proceeding along those
                lines. We also have £2·5&nbsp;million for the red-meat
                marketing strategy. It is extremely important that my Department
                has made this provision. Many of the problems in the market at
                the moment have been caused by the BSE crisis and the resistance
                to red meat.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to explain to the people, not just in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland but also further afield, that
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland beef is the safest on these islands. I am
                determined to pursue low incidence BSE status for
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland. I have made that one of my priorities.
                Mr&nbsp;Savage, Mr&nbsp;Bradley, Mr&nbsp;Roche,
                Mr&nbsp;Armstrong and Mr&nbsp;Poots, and perhaps others, have
                referred to this. I spoke to Nick&nbsp;Brown about it again last
                week, and I have his, and Joe&nbsp;Walsh’s, support. We are
                making progress, but I am not unaware of the potential
                difficulties. I know that the idea does not command 100%
                support, even within Northern&nbsp;Ireland, and there could be
                major hurdles in London and Brussels. I am determined to do all
                that I can for the beef farmers of Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I realise that I am about to run out of time.
                Mr&nbsp;McGrady referred to the early retirement scheme. That
                scheme would be extremely costly. If we could afford it, it
                would be welcome to the farmers. One of the things that have
                been impressed upon me by the industry is that, whatever money
                that is available, there should be maximum winners and minimum
                losers. The early retirement scheme would mean minimum winners
                and maximum losers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will reply in writing to the other points.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I emphasise again that many Members wished to
                speak. The Minister could have done with more time to give
                answers. That is an expression of the concern of the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I now call Mr&nbsp;Kane to wind up the
                debate.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Kane:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I would challenge the Minister about
                the millions of pounds of additional money. This money went to
                the Department to pay off bad debt. She has failed to respond to
                all the prescriptive measures.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The demonstrations converging on the grounds
                of this building today are the result of neglecting the primary
                producers of that upon which life depends — food. Let nobody
                in the House think that farmers are crying wolf or that the
                agriculture crisis is something affecting only farmers and their
                families. An 80% reduction in farm incomes must translate into a
                colossal reduction in purchases from the multitude of suppliers
                who surround agriculture. The devastation will be widespread if
                it remains unchecked.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An array of factors are cited as having
                contributed to the collapse of the value of agri-produce. The
                strength of sterling, a world surplus, and a worldwide ban
                resulting from the discovery of BSE in our cattle have all been
                mentioned. The strength of sterling in comparison with the
                strength of other currencies is obvious. A world surplus of
                agricultural produce is a likely factor, since other non-members
                of the EU are also experiencing problems in agriculture. The
                weakest of reasons for explaining what is happening to this
                industry, arguably Northern&nbsp;Ireland’s staple industry, is
                the export ban. Scientists have concluded that, our beef is safe
                to eat. We already knew that. Subsequently the ban was lifted.
                However, despite the scientific evidence and the European
                Commission’s removal of the trade embargo, the French
                Government have imposed their own embargo, thus contravening
                European law.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With the price of its agricultural produce,
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland is fast becoming the poor man of Europe,
                and we do not need any further disadvantages imposed. The
                farming industry requires immediate financial aid, for its
                survival. Circumstances make our farmers the poorest in Europe
                as well as the least well-off in the United&nbsp;Kingdom. In the
                week ending 22&nbsp;January&nbsp;2000 the average steer price in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland was 158·6p per kilo, while in Great
                Britain the average price was 176·7p per kilo.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is a difference of £63·35 on a
                350-kilo carcass, representing a considerable margin between the
                two producers. It is a similar situation with lamb. In the same
                period the Great Britain price per kilo was 185·5p, as opposed
                to 176·07p in Northern&nbsp;Ireland, and that means a
                disadvantage to the Province of over £2 on a 21-kilo carcass.
                These examples highlight the disparity between the regions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Producers here have also had a reduction of
                almost one third in the price of milk. This, combined with the
                removal of the calf processing scheme, produces an animal
                welfare problem as well as a financial one.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Despite pleas to the Government and the new
                Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, the pig
                industry is disappearing even as we speak. The industry does not
                perceive the reduction contained in the Agenda&nbsp;2000 CAP
                reforms as a means of increasing prices. Rather, it is seen as a
                method of curbing production in an already distressed market. A
                4% cut in suckler cow quotas, or a 2·5% cut in premium levels
                through modulation, can do nothing but further damage an
                industry already on its knees.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yet, with the resolve of the
                UK&nbsp;Government and the Northern&nbsp;Ireland Minister of
                Agriculture and Rural Development to push for low incidence BSE
                status for Northern&nbsp;Ireland, we could regain our exports of
                beef to the continent.</p>

                to ascertain whether at least the Member and the Minister can be
                available earlier. Standing Orders were not suspended to a
                particular time, and I think that it would be possible to have

                Members will know that the Adjournment debate is from
                5.00&nbsp;pm until 6.00&nbsp;pm. It would hardly be fair to them
                to start the debate early simply because the First&nbsp;Minister
                could not get his act together and give Members proper notice.
                He has run away again. My party could not even table an
                amendment, otherwise we could have done something about this.
                This is another example of contempt of the House — bringing
                Members together and then suddenly saying &quot;Not moved.&quot;</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Adjournment debate should begin at

                that everyone wishing to take part in the debate can do so. Why

                from this debate? This does have an effect on the number of
                Members who were denied an opportunity to speak during the
                agriculture debate this morning. The Ulster Unionist Party has
                withdrawn from the Chamber again. It is probably ensconced in an

                the amount of time that was available, some did not even put the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been widespread consternation in
                schools across the Province over the last two&nbsp;months since
                the appointment of the Minister of Education. Furthermore, his
                party has been actively engaged in the disruption of schools,
                disruption which the Minister has not condemned. He may like to
                run away from the fact that his appointment caused such anger,
                but the truth is that there have been unprecedented occurrences
                in schools since then.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have witnessed whole schools being called
                together to debate this matter, schoolchildren voting not to
                have the Minister near their school, boards of governors meeting
                and resolving that he will not be invited to their schools and,
                indeed, on some occasions, protests. He may wish to forget all
                this, along with some other matters to which I shall come in a
                moment. The fact remains, however, that his appointment has been
                an embarrassment for the Department of Education and for the
                party — and I note that most of its Members are absent today
                — that was responsible for the setting up of an Executive
                which included Sinn&nbsp;Féin.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister said yesterday that he wanted a
                quiet life. He said that he wanted a Dobermann to sit at his
                feet. He thought that I was going to do that. He must have
                mistaken me for someone else — the &quot;pup&quot; from
                East&nbsp;Belfast who is occasionally given to licking the
                Minister’s hand. Let me assure the Minster, however, that I do
                not intend to sit at his feet. In fact, I have made it quite
                clear that my role in the Assembly will be to snap at his ankles
                and, when I can, sink my teeth into his ministerial calf. We
                have set ourselves the task of opposing Sinn&nbsp;Féin, not
                co-operating with it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the First Minister announced the draft
                programme of legislation yesterday he said that he would be
                introducing a Dogs&nbsp;Bill. This Dogs&nbsp;Bill was to give
                the courts or resident magistrates discretion in all
                circumstances, including the circumstances of an attack, in
                determining the fate of a dog. I do not know if the Minister of
                Education had any say in having that included in the
                legislation. Perhaps he was merely preparing himself for the
                future. Perhaps, as we all suspect, members of
                IRA/Sinn&nbsp;Féin have their own methods of dealing with those
                who oppose them. They wish to hold on to their guns, because the
                tried and tested Republican methods of dealing with dissent are
                still close to their hearts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to look at the various ways in which
                schools have been disrupted. First, this disruption has been
                caused by anxiety at the Minister’s appointment. The Minister
                would love to believe that this was orchestrated, that it was
                politically motivated by parties with a point to make. Of
                course, he must believe this, for to accept otherwise would be
                to accept that there is widespread loathing of him because of
                his background and because of what he and his colleagues have
                done to the people of Northern&nbsp;Ireland. He chooses to
                believe that this disruption was not spontaneous but
                orchestrated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My party has made it quite clear that we do
                not believe that youngsters should disadvantage themselves
                because of the appointment of a Sinn&nbsp;Féin Minister. They
                are quite right to make clear their opposition, as are parents,
                boards of governors and teachers. However, children should not
                be disadvantaging themselves by damaging their education.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister’s appointment has caused
                widespread disruption. Of course, since then his party
                colleagues have been causing disruption in schools without any
                condemnation from him. Sinn&nbsp;Féin disrupted the school in
                Pomeroy because it dared to invite a duchess. The Minister has
                said that he will try to sort this out, but he has not condemned
                it because he is not against intimidation. One has only to look
                at the behaviour of Mr&nbsp;McElduff in Carrickmore to see that
                Sinn&nbsp;Féin is not opposed to intimidation. What he was
                annoyed about was that the behaviour of the ignoramuses in
                Pomeroy held IRA/Sinn&nbsp;Féin up to ridicule among their own.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The argument went something like this: as she
                is a duchess, she must be a member of the royal family and must
                therefore oppress Catholics. It is a bit like saying &quot;Your
                name is Gerry, so you must be a German and a Fascist.&quot; I
                suppose the first and last parts are right, but not the middle
                part. That is what they were angry about.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Look at what happened in the Assembly
                yesterday. The Minister made it quite clear, in response to
                Mr&nbsp;Weir, that he is not against intimidation or
                interference in schools. He admitted that he pulled his
                youngster out of a class because the RUC was present. That gives
                the green light to all the Finbar&nbsp;Conways that lurk in the
                towns around Northern&nbsp;Ireland, under the guise of
                Sinn&nbsp;Féin. It will not be too long before they will be
                taking the lead from the Minister and pulling their children out
                of school, or maybe other people’s children out, or maybe the
                teachers. The Minister has said that if the RUC is in a school,
                it is OK to go in and disrupt it.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That must be a country term. I do not know
                what a hallion is.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is quite clear that the Minister has laid
                himself wide open and that his party has been encouraged to
                behave in this way. It is no wonder that his activities have
                been condemned by teachers’ unions, by principals and by
                parents. It is significant that he will not publish what schools
                he intends to go to. That could be a relic of his secretive past
                when he was used to, as he bragged on his first public
                engagement, flitting from safe house to safe house. Now he is
                going to flit from safe school to safe school in secrecy. He
                knows that, because of his record, he is not accepted in this
                Province or in many of its schools.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister has promised future disruption
                of the school system in Northern&nbsp;Ireland. He has promised
                to dismantle what is best about our education system. Yesterday
                he attacked the school system — a school system which,
                incidentally, people in other parts of the United&nbsp;Kingdom
                envy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ironically, the same Minister has praised our
                school system this very day in his statement about improved
                school performances. He said that 56% of pupils achieved five or
                more A&nbsp;to&nbsp;C&nbsp;grades at GCSE, compared to pupils in
                England, only 48% of whom reached that standard in 1999. I will
                not be able to go into this as my time is nearly finished, but
                he intends to disrupt a system, which is the envy of other parts
                of the United&nbsp;Kingdom, in his pursuit of socialist
                ideology. He and his colleagues have been good at levelling for
                the last 30 years. They have levelled towns and villages all
                over this Province. Now he wants to level down our education
                system, with all the disruption that that would cause.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Education does not have the
                confidence of those whom he claims to administer. He does not
                have that confidence because of his behaviour and that of his
                colleagues, and he does not have that confidence because of what
                he is threatening to do to the system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two&nbsp;months ago the leader of the Ulster
                Unionist Party told us that in setting up an Executive which
                includes Sinn&nbsp;Féin he had got the best deal for
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland. Within two months we were to be rid of
                guns when we had Sinn&nbsp;Féin Ministers in Government. They
                would be poachers turned gamekeepers — all would be well. He
                has given the poachers the run of the estate. He himself has run
                away today from the debate on disarmament that he had promised
                the House. He did not deliver a good deal for the people of
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland. He delivered a rotten deal, and with it
                we have got a rotten Minister, who ought to go.</p>

                almost no names of Members wishing to speak, save for
                Mr&nbsp;Wilson and, of course, the Minister, who will respond to
                this debate. Since then I have received a number of names. There
                has been no time limit, for I was unable to set one, not knowing
                the situation. I propose to the Assembly, so that those whose
                names are down can have an opportunity to speak, that we limit
                each Member to five&nbsp;minutes. I seek the leave of the

                It is normal practice to give the Minister 10&nbsp;minutes for
                each hour. As you will recall, the last Adjournment debate
                lasted three&nbsp;hours, and the Minister had about
                half&nbsp;an&nbsp;hour to respond on that occasion. Do I have
                the leave of the Assembly to restrict Members to
                five&nbsp;minutes?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further to that point of order, Mr Speaker.
                Will you exercise a little discretion in time allocations so
                that Members need not confine themselves exactly to
                five&nbsp;minutes? If they were halfway through an important
                sentence would you cut them off?</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The difficulty is that I am very much aware
                that in such circumstances Members, seeing the time limit coming
                up, have the capacity to produce the longest sentences. They
                speak in paragraphs then. If Members know they have
                five&nbsp;minutes, they can watch the clock. If there is no
                limit, there will be arguments saying that one Member got more
                time than another, and so on. I ask the leave of the Assembly to
                restrict speeches to five&nbsp;minutes so that those Members
                whose names are down will have an opportunity to speak.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am tempted to suggest that there was a fair
                bit of winding up in the first speech. There is no winding-up
                time in an Adjournment debate. I will therefore restrict all
                Members to five&nbsp;minutes. I advise them to watch the
                stopwatches and to match the length of their last sentence to

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Kennedy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful for the opportunity provided by
                Mr&nbsp;Wilson, the Member for East&nbsp;Belfast, to speak in
                this important debate. The appointment of the current Minister
                of Education generated a very negative response in the entire
                community, and particularly in the Unionist community. This
                reaction was inevitable given the public persona and background
                of the individual concerned. Many people, including parents,
                governors, teachers, educationalists and pupils, expressed
                concern about the implications of the appointment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those concerns were manifest in the number of
                school protests, petitions and letters of protest by school
                children throughout the Province. Many representations were made
                to me as Chairman of the Education Committee, and I attempted to
                assist in what was an extremely difficult situation. I, along
                with Mr&nbsp;Wilson, the Member for East&nbsp;Belfast, met with
                groups of pupils, teachers and parents. I publicly appealed for
                restraint to be exercised by everyone, including the new
                Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many of the Minister’s actions and public
                statements were unhelpful — in particular, his reference to
                his having been on the run in County&nbsp;Leitrim. I am very
                satisfied, however, that most of the protests were spontaneous
                events organised by pupils and not orchestrated by any political
                party, as alleged at the time. I pay tribute to the important
                restraining influence exercised by teachers and parents in that
                emotive period. Their great common sense ensured that the issue
                did not adversely affect the long-term educational prospects of
                the children, who, understandably, felt very strongly on this
                issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My party has always believed that sectarian
                politics should be kept out of schools at all costs, and I
                believe that this view is strongly supported by parents
                everywhere. It was a matter of great regret that in January the
                disruption in schools took a very different turn with the events
                in Pomeroy. This episode proved to be remarkable in many
                respects. It was not so much an Aesop’s fable as a Grimm tale.
                It was deadly serious, and it could almost be told in the
                language of a fairy story — so let us have a go.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once upon a time, not so very long ago and in
                a place not so very far away, there lived a man called Mr&nbsp;Finbar.
                Mr&nbsp;Finbar had red hair, and he appeared to eat well. He
                rested a lot in a comfortable armchair where he thought thoughts
                and heard voices. One day Mr&nbsp;Finbar heard voices tell him
                that a royal princess from a neighbouring land was coming to see
                some local children. Mr&nbsp;Finbar hated the royals from this
                land, but he had no objection to carrying around some of their
                pictures in his wallet. Mr&nbsp;Finbar objected to the visit of
                the royal princess and said that she was not wanted by local
                children. However, it turned out that the royal princess was not
                really a princess — she just knew some members of the royal
                family.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I draw the Member’s attention to the fact
                that the debate is about disruption in schools, not
                entertainment in schools.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thank you very much.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, she was a very nice person who had a
                famous ancestor who was good at writing. She wanted to tell all
                the boys and girls about him. In fact, a local man called Seamus,
                who was good at verse, liked her and helped her. But Mr&nbsp;Finbar
                would not budge. He stopped the visit, and all the local
                children were sad.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ah.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Finbar did not care, for he had an
                important friend called Martin, whom he sometimes saw. He knew
                that Martin would support him. But Martin had been very busy
                lately, for he had a new job and lots of new friends. He was
                very busy. But even though lots of people complained about
                Mr&nbsp;Finbar, Martin would not criticise his dear friend. So
                the very nice lady went off to other schools to tell the
                children about her story. And Mr&nbsp;Finbar and his friends
                lived not happily ever after but in an atmosphere of sectarian
                hatred, malice and spite.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I believed that we were here to debate a real
                problem in education, in a real way. I did not know that it was
                to be a highjacking of the Minister of Education or a party
                political table tennis match. There is a real problem, and
                educationalists who understand the situation in schools
                recognise it. However, since other Members have decided to go
                down a political-point-scoring route and ignore the serious
                nature of this problem, I would like to take the few minutes
                allocated to me to focus on that problem and on the plight of
                teachers, parents and children involved in it. I refer to the
                growing problem of disruption in schools.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This problem is not centred in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland; it has European dimensions and is related
                to the changing nature of our society. We are moving from an old
                authoritarian, almost militaristic, way of dealing with
                education to a more democratic way and to a more democratic
                society. We are moving from a system that had strict diktats,
                order and discipline in the classroom to one which is more open
                and co-operative. In the old system, corporal punishment was
                used to attain and maintain control. As our society has changed,
                we have had to look at methods other than the use of force to
                get the attention of children. We are now trying to work with
                people and give them the support that they need. The teacher in
                the classroom is hard-pressed to cope with this changing
                situation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was an old academic argument about the
                origin of the word &quot;education&quot;. It was accepted that
                it came from Latin. But there are two Latin words<i>: </i>&quot;<i>educere</i>&quot;,
                which means &quot;to drive&quot;, and &quot;<i>educare</i>&quot;,
                which means &quot;to lead&quot;. The new way of looking at
                education during the last few decades has been to try to lead
                the children to education. Society, however, still expects a
                disciplinarian approach — the old system — and that has led
                to conflict in the classroom.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appeal to the Minister and his Department
                to examine this problem and not be diverted by the sort of
                political foreplay we have witnessed today. They should look at
                the matter seriously and try to find the resources that are
                required, for resources are needed. If action is not taken to
                deal quickly, and in a proper, supportive way, with a disruptive
                child in the classroom, the problem can grow. I do not
                particularly subscribe to the old adage that one rotten apple
                turns the rest of the barrel bad, but it certainly has an
                effect. One can see this when one is trying to maintain control
                for the benefit of the other 99% of the children, whose quality
                of education suffers because of the disruptive pupil. There is a
                great need to put those resources into place to help teachers.
                This is real disruption in education.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our present system includes social workers
                and a whole stratum of other people to help. The children who
                need specialist help continue to fall between two stools. They
                fail to get the attention they deserve and the support they need
                simply because the necessary resources and expertise are not
                available. I appeal to the Minister and to the Department to
                ensure that they are made available.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member for South&nbsp;Down said that this
                is a very important issue. It is a very important issue for all
                who have a particular interest in the education of our children.
                It is also an important issue for many of us who believe that
                the protests that were held over the last few weeks were held
                for a purpose — and that purpose was not just to grab the
                headlines. There were spontaneous protests by secondary school
                children, who took it upon themselves to show where they stand
                on these matters. We need to understand why they did that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all know that the Sinn&nbsp;Féin
                spokesman, on his first school visit, used the words &quot;fun
                on the run&quot;. This was highly publicised in the media. Of
                course, it was all right for him to grab the headlines on his
                first school visit but to grab them by telling children about
                the time when he was hiding from the security forces, glorifying
                terrorism itself. Is that what a Minister should be doing? After
                that can anyone really say that it is wrong for schoolchildren,
                many of whom were supported by their parents, to protest? I say
                &quot;No.&quot; I am concerned that the Minister masquerades as
                a respectable person and a respectable Minister, when the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some criticism has been levelled by members
                of the Ulster Unionist Party, the SDLP and the
                Alliance&nbsp;Party about the protests that have taken place.
                Certain Ulster Unionists are symptomatic of a party that has
                made political ideals out of capitulation. They have said
                &quot;We will go along with the process even though we know it
                is wrong.&quot; I exclude the Member who spoke today on behalf
                of the Ulster Unionist Party, for he has obviously taken a stand
                on this issue. The party’s decision-making body has become so
                used to surrendering principles that when individuals dare to
                stand up for justice they are heckled and in some cases
                ridiculed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Pomeroy is an example of the so-called

                in a position where his own party members are trying to make
                capital out of a visit to a school by a friend of the royal

                information. All the children from all the secondary schools in
                the area protested. Why? Because the Minister is not acceptable
                to them. They were concerned, and most of them were supported by
                their parents. That is the good thing. They were not on their
                own in this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those children who did go out showed a
                political awareness of what was happening far beyond that
                displayed by some of their parents and elders. They are not
                merely teenagers who decided to take a couple of hours off
                school. After the protests had taken place, they went back to
                classes. We want to see them excelling — that is important —
                but the Minister who is responsible for education is not
                acceptable to them. This group of mature young people deserve to

                how principals and teachers can maintain authority in schools to
                benefit and educate our children. One of the failures of the

                a debate on the very relevant points raised by Mr&nbsp;ONeill.
                Today’s debate is about the protests, and, of course, the DUP
                was the driving force behind them. If the television cameras
                were at a protest, so was a DUP councillor, and some DUP
                councillors have children at the schools. They were at every
                protest, raising issues on behalf of the children. I have no

                school; others do attend but disrupt classes, thus depriving
                others of the chance of a good education. If we were able to
                come up with a system to deal with that, if we were able to give

                example of a good school with good pupils, good teachers and a
                good educational system which has provided its pupils with good
                prospects. I would like to put on the record the Assembly’s

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that what I am saying will, if nothing
                else, send a signal to DUP Members that they cannot engage in
                street protests or disruption and then deny others the right to
                protest.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of the jocular comments made today take
                away from what is a serious issue. The people of
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland are totally outraged at the appointment of
                a Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA Minister of Education. A large part of the
                blame must lie with the Ulster Unionist Party and the other
                pro-agreement parties who allowed them to get into the Executive
                and have never signed a motion to exclude them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have to warn the Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA
                Minister of Education that, despite his assertion that he aims
                to visit all schools, he is not welcome in all schools,
                particularly those in Unionist areas. He is certainly not wanted
                in my constituency. His visits will be opposed by parents and
                the general public alike. Many principals, boards of governors,
                parents and pupils to whom I have spoken are absolutely outraged
                at his appointment. In my constituency, some people whose
                children go to Methodist&nbsp;College have withdrawn their
                voluntary contributions in protest at the school’s invitation
                to the Minister. Pupils were put in the nauseating position of
                having to stomach Martin&nbsp;McGuinness in their classrooms.
                The Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA Minister sat beside pupils, and they
                were almost physically sick. Fortunately, Methodist&nbsp;College
                does not reflect the thinking of other schools, as can be seen
                by the spontaneous protests of their pupils, and its head must
                be condemned for his actions.</p>

                the activities of Mr&nbsp;McGuinness and his colleagues over the
                last 30&nbsp;years, given the disruption they have brought to
                schools throughout the Province. I know children, including my
                own, who have had to dodge bombs and broken glass from the
                fronts of buildings in the centre of Belfast year after year. It
                caused disruption in schools, and parents had difficulty leaving
                their children off to school, wondering if they would be safe at
                the end of the day. These are things that the people of
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland will not easily forget.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the use of children in
                protests against the Minister’s appointment, I must say that
                these protests have come from people who may have more sense
                than their peers. The young people of this Province are not
                totally isolated from the reality of what has happened.</p>

                think that his education does not matter. Government figures
                suggest that 80% of parents fail to turn up when asked to appear
                in court after their child has been absent for a considerable
                time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA Education
                Minister is hardly a suitable role model for reducing truancy,
                having spent part of his school days on the run. In fact, in
                today’s ‘News&nbsp;Letter’ it is reported that he kept his
                own son off school. Why? Because the RUC was giving a talk on
                road safety. We have had 30&nbsp;years of disruption, bombs and
                bomb scares throughout our towns and cities. We have had schools
                wrecked by explosions, yet Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA Members have the
                cheek to talk in the House about disruption in schools.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On an academic level it is more likely that
                truants will leave school without qualifications. Only 8% of
                persistent truants obtain five&nbsp;GCSEs or more, compared to
                54% of those who have never played truant. What sort of example
                does the Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA Minister give to the young people
                of Northern&nbsp;Ireland? In an Audit Commission report entitled
                ‘Misspent Youth’ it was suggested that 23% of people
                sentenced in court had engaged in truancy at a significant
                level. The police have indicated that almost 40% of street
                robberies and 20% of criminal damage is caused by 10- to
                16-year-olds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How can a Member who is inextricably linked
                to a terrorist organisation hold this position? The people of
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland will not tolerate it. He must go.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to respond to the scurrilous
                remarks of Members opposite about the nature of the schools
                protest. I want to nail the lie that this was organised,
                manipulated or even encouraged by members of my party or any
                other Unionist party. As one who visited the first protest, when
                400 children from Kilkeel spontaneously left their classes in
                protest against the appointment of a Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA
                Minister, I emphasise the facts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was in a meeting at Translink with the
                Minister for Regional Development when I got a telephone call
                telling me that the children had been out for two&nbsp;hours and
                wanted me, as their local Assembly Member, to come down, collect
                a petition and address them. I told them that having made their
                protest, they should go back to their classes and that when the
                school bell rang I would meet them to collect their petition and
                speak to them. That is exactly what I did, because I was
                concerned that some of them were outside the school grounds. The
                Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA Minister knows that. I took their petition,
                which I know has the support not just of the children but of
                their parents as well.</p>

                unveiled a memorial to 11&nbsp;members of the security forces
                murdered by Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA. The nieces, nephews and
                grandchildren of those people were in that school. As citizens
                of this Province, they have a right to protest against this
                individual’s being the Minister of Education.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must remember that this individual’s
                organisation murdered bus drivers in front of school children,
                murdered a headmaster in front of 40&nbsp;seven-year-olds,
                murdered people who were delivering to and building schools and
                murdered ancillary workers in schools. The individual no doubt
                knows the names and addresses of those who carried out these
                deeds. Has he given them to the security forces? He has not.
                There is a great deal of anger throughout the Province. The
                Minister is not welcome in any state school in South&nbsp;Down.
                The only way he can come to these schools is if he forces

                difficult job to date. I also congratulate him for taking the

                responded to what was obviously a shoddy attempt by the DUP to
                have some sort of rant. However, he took the time to attend and
                showed respect to the House — respect that was not shown
                earlier today by people who claim to be defenders of the
                democratic principles. Those people showed up to lead us all a
                merry dance, to pull a motion and to leave us all high and dry.</p>

                up along with him. Perhaps the pupils had their own PR
                operation. However, it is not only the silly protests which the
                DUP organise that are disrupting schools. There have been
                instances in my own area, an area with which the Chairman of the
                Education Committee should be quite familiar. At Forkhill
                Primary School a helicopter flying overhead to a
                British&nbsp;Army base, which dwarfs that primary school,
                dropped its full cargo in the playground. At St&nbsp;Paul’s in
                Bessbrook, O&nbsp;level and A&nbsp;level students were forced to
                protest publicly on the road outside their school about
                disruption during their exams caused by the constant hovering of
                helicopters above the school. <i>[Interruption]</p>

                distress of children who were leaving the nursery. In January
                this year another British&nbsp;Army foot patrol entered school
                grounds during class time, and when they were challenged by the

                warfare organised and instituted by Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA,
                particularly in an area such as south Armagh, has caused all
                these things? It is very important that security considerations
                be met and that there be a response to the security
                requirements. These situations were brought about entirely by
                the actions of Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA and the Republican movement.</p>

                four years, since the ceasefire has been organised, there have
                been no such events in that area, and I am not aware of any
                allegation that the nursery school children of Bessbrook primary
                school were carrying out activities against the
                British&nbsp;Army.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the school staff challenged members of
                the foot patrol about walking through school grounds they were
                met with indifference and hostility. Sadly, the Chairman of the
                Education Committee — I am glad he intervened — found this
                case a source of great amusement when it was brought to his
                attention in the council chamber. He did not even express
                concern that this should be happening in a primary school in his
                own constituency. However, that does not surprise me, given his
                ‘Alice in Wonderland’ speech earlier. It seems that he is
                not attached to this planet by very much.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another case is that of Glassdrumman&nbsp;Primary
                School. The British&nbsp;Army decided to build a spy post close
                by and fly dozens of helicopter flights above it daily. The
                parents organised themselves in order to oppose this. They have
                banded together and taken their case to the NIO Ministers, but
                so far it has fallen on deaf ears.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To add insult, in December last year the RUC
                asked if they could attend Glassdrumman&nbsp;Primary School.
                When the principal told them that they would not be welcome the
                RUC turned up and forced their way on to the school grounds.
                This incident was brought to the attention of the media, but for
                some strange reason they did not find this a worthy news story.
                I have to compare that with the hullabaloo they created around
                Pomeroy, Carrickmore and other such places.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is unfortunate when time in Adjournment
                debates is wasted, and I regret that I had to put the counter to
                the disruption that the DUP talked about by raising the matter
                of the disruption that happens from their friends in the
                military. I agree with Francie&nbsp;Molloy and Eamon&nbsp;ONeill.
                Time in the Chamber should be spent on debating the important
                issues in education — issues that cause real disruption in
                schools.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once again I congratulate the Minister for
                not being deterred by such silly motions or by so-called
                spontaneous protests organised in schools, but for getting on
                with the job that the Assembly mandated him to do.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Education (Mr M McGuinness):</b>
                </p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Chathaoirligh, I am grateful to
                Mr&nbsp;Wilson for raising the issue of disruption in schools
                and providing an opportunity for discussion of this important
                issue. I was appointed Minister of Education as part of the
                implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, which, as we all
                know, was overwhelmingly endorsed by the electorate, both North
                and South.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That agreement created new political
                arrangements under which locally elected representatives of all
                parties can work together to create a better future for all of
                our people, and I intend to play a full part in that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand that many people continue to
                carry pain and hurt from all that has happened in the past and
                that many have fears and concerns about the future. These
                uncertainties affect all of us. However, I would like to stress,
                as I have done on a number of occasions since my appointment as
                Minister of Education, that I am totally committed to promoting
                the interests of all our children and ensuring that they are
                treated in a fair and equal manner. I will do my utmost to
                ensure that our education service continues to improve the
                standards of teaching and learning for all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While I recognise the concerns of some
                parents and pupils, I was disappointed that pupils in a minority
                of schools decided to leave their schools to protest against my
                appointment. I support the right of young people to express
                their views through protest, but I am also concerned at the
                effect that these disruptions may have on the education of the
                children involved and at the risk potential when pupils are out
                of school without authorisation and supervision. These
                disruptions have caused considerable distress and anxiety to
                staff in the schools affected. They have worked hard, and with
                considerable success over the years, to keep the focus within
                schools firmly on education. They have done, and continue to do,
                a fantastic job, and I would like to express my thanks for and
                admiration of their work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For their sake, and for the sake of the
                pupils, I am glad that these disruptions have ended. It is
                regrettable, however, that those politicians who mysteriously
                appeared within minutes at the supposedly impromptu protests did
                not bear these considerations in mind. One wonders whose
                interests they really have at heart.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, not all pupils who protested chose
                to leave school; others took a more constructive approach and
                wrote to me. They protested, and they set out their concerns.
                Some of them actually asked to meet with me, and I was pleased
                to discuss the issues face to face with young people from a
                controlled secondary school. We had a productive and civilised
                exchange of views. That, I believe, is the way in which these
                matters should be resolved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is dialogue that my visits to schools are
                intended to promote. As a new Minister, I have a lot to learn
                about education, but I am learning fast. I am anxious to learn
                about the issues from those who are at the chalkface, those who
                are delivering the service in the schools, as well as from my
                departmental officials and others involved in the administration
                of education.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I intend to visit as many schools as I can,
                and I have many outstanding invitations. However, I will be
                visiting only schools to which I have been invited. My visits to
                date have been extremely enlightening. I have seen the excellent
                work which teachers are doing, often in difficult circumstances
                and in poor conditions, and I have listened to the issues that
                concern them and their pupils. I intend to build on this
                constructive dialogue so that collectively we can ensure the
                best education possible for all our children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A number of issues were raised.
                Sammy&nbsp;Wilson’s contribution was generally good-humoured,
                and I thank him for that, although he did somewhat confuse the
                towns of Carrickmore and Carrickfergus. Nevertheless, I totally
                agree with him that the performance tables which were published
                today by my Department are good news. They show a steady rise in
                standards. I would like to congratulate all in the education
                system, both teachers and pupils, for their hard work and
                success.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue of the proposed visit by the
                Duchess&nbsp;of Abercorn to St&nbsp;Mary’s Primary School in
                Pomeroy was raised by Sammy&nbsp;Wilson. I believe that I made
                it clear during Question&nbsp;Time yesterday that who visits a
                particular school is a matter for the school principal and the
                chairman of the board of governors. This is a well-established
                departmental policy, and it will continue.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Where there is a disagreement over a visit, I
                hope that it will be settled amicably by the people directly
                involved. As Members will be aware, I have spoken to the
                principal of the school, and I am confident that this matter can
                be resolved satisfactorily.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr&nbsp;Speaker. Was

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I said at the start that I would give
                five&nbsp;minutes to each Member and 10&nbsp;minutes to the
                Minister.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes. I shall run after six&nbsp;o’clock,
                since, as I said, the time that points of order take does not
                come out of the time allocated to Members.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am quite happy, but I would not wish anyone
                to think that one could do that for the Minister and not for
                others.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Indeed. On Mondays the requirement is for
                interruption at six&nbsp;o’clock. That is in Standing Orders.
                As the Member will be aware, Standing Orders were suspended
                today, so time is not quite so tight. In any case, it is a
                Tuesday.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M McGuinness:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I should also like to thank
                Danny&nbsp;Kennedy for his contribution. I do not imagine that
                he will ever win the Pushkin&nbsp;Prize, but I look forward to
                hearing many more of his yarns at the Education Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Eamonn&nbsp;ONeill made a particularly
                thoughtful contribution on discipline in schools. This is an
                important issue. Each school is required to have a policy for
                the promotion of good behaviour and discipline among its pupils.
                The content of a school’s discipline policy and its rules and
                sanctions are matters for the school. Guidelines on what should
                be included are in preparation and will be issued later this
                year. Resources have been made available for the development of
                pupil referral units to help schools deal with particularly
                disruptive pupils.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Norman&nbsp;Boyd raised the issue of my
                visits to schools. As I said earlier, I consider school visits
                to be an important aspect of my job, since they give me an
                opportunity to listen to the views of teachers and pupils. I
                shall visit only those schools to which I am invited, and I have
                had invitations to schools of all management types.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are many challenges facing the
                education system as we move into the twenty-first century. We
                have to deal with low achievement; there are challenges in the
                school estate; we want to increase access and participation; and
                we want to promote a culture of tolerance and respect for
                diversity among our people. In addressing these challenges, I
                shall be guided by the principles of promoting excellence,
                providing choice, enhancing accessibility and ensuring equality.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is indeed vital that our schools provide
                the skills and knowledge which children need to enable them to
                be fulfilled and to succeed in life. The economy and society
                need them to in order to thrive. That is the agenda to which I
                am working. It is an education agenda. It is an agenda for all
                our children, and I hope that Members will judge my success as
                Minister of Education against it. Go raibh maith agat.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells: </b>On a point of order, Mr
                Speaker. It is in order for the Minister to mislead the House?
                My party made it very clear that it was not involved in
                organising the protest against his appointments.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker: </b>Order. That matter was raised
