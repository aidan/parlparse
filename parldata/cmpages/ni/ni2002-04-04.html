                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is my solemn and sad duty to advise the
                House of the passing of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth The Queen
                Mother, who died peacefully in her sleep on March 30, 2002 in
                her one-hundred-and-second year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today’s sitting has been called for the
                special, sole and express purpose of giving the Assembly an
                opportunity to pay its respects to The Queen Mother for her long
                and extraordinary life of service not only to our country, but
                to the Commonwealth as a whole and to express condolences to Her
                Majesty The Queen and all the Royal Family.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask you now to stand in your places and
                pause to reflect for a minute, giving thanks for a life lived
                well and in the service of others.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members observed a minute’s silence.</p>
                </i><b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister (Mr Trimble):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to say how much I, and I am sure
                other Members here, appreciate the fact that the Assembly has
                been recalled on this occasion to enable us to offer our
                condolences to Her Majesty The Queen and other members of the
                Royal Family on the death of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth The
                Queen Mother. It is entirely appropriate that we have this
                opportunity to do so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will know that the coffin of Her
                Majesty Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother will be moved from the
                vicinity of Clarence House to the Palace of Westminster
                tomorrow. It will be accompanied by the lieutenant colonels of
                the regiments of which she was Hon Colonel, who will act as
                pall-bearers. However, the bearer party will not be drawn from
                any of those regiments; it will be drawn from the Irish Guards.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A few moments ago, I discovered that the
                grandson of Sir John Gorman — whom I am delighted to see with
                us today — will be among the dozen members of the bearer
                party. It marks the very close association between Her Majesty
                and the Irish Guards — an association that dates back to 1928,
                when, as Duchess of York, she presented a shamrock to the Irish
                Guards on St Patrick’s Day, something that she has
                punctiliously done since then.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the characteristics of Her Majesty —
                no doubt shaped by her experiences in both world wars — is the
                close attention she has paid to servicemen and ex-servicemen,
                marking their service and the anniversaries associated with
                them. Part of that association is with the Black Watch, the
                regiment raised in the part of Scotland where she grew up, and
                in which her brothers served during the first world war. Indeed,
                one of her brothers was killed in 1915 at the Battle of Loos.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was characteristic of The Queen Mother
                that, when she discovered 60 years later that her brother had
                been tended by another soldier — a Dublin Fusilier — just
                before his death, she immediately arranged for that soldier to
                come from Dublin to Clarence House to meet her. Instances such
                as that marked her character.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the past few days many people have
                paid tribute to her character, the extraordinary grace and
                lightness of touch with which she discharged her functions as
                Queen Mother and the way in which she made everybody with whom
                she came in contact feel an openness and an easiness of
                approach. She did this without any sacrifice of majesty.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A very strong sense of humour was associated
                with her, and we have heard many examples of that in the past
                few days. However, most people when looking back at her long
                life — nearly 102 years, half of which were spent as Queen
                Mother — will associate her with carrying out a wide range of
                official functions and doing so with the lightness and grace
                already mentioned.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we reflect on her life as a whole,
                however, we have to reflect on the 16 years in which she was
                Queen Consort, and many people remember the special contribution
                she made during the second world war. In 1939, shortly after the
                declaration of war, it was suggested that The Queen Consort and
                the young Princesses should be evacuated to Canada for safety
                from the threat of air raids. Her response was characteristic:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The children will not leave without me.
                I will not leave without The King, and The King will never
                leave.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I suspect, as many people do, that the
                decision was made by her rather than The King. However, once the
                war touched the country during the air raids of 1940-41, and
                thereafter, she demonstrated her fortitude by not leaving the
                palace or London; by sharing the same dangers as others, and by
                visiting bombed areas very soon thereafter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those visits were not confined to the East
                End. She visited other cities, and she was in Belfast in 1942 to
                see the damage that had been done here. While there is a focus
                on the contribution that she made during the wartime years, the
                contribution in the years immediately preceding that war was, if
                anything, more significant. We were faced with a remarkable
                challenge from an unusual blend of nationalism and socialism
                that had arisen in Germany, and there were elements in society,
                on the right and the left, who were not clear about their
                response to that challenge, but that cannot be said of The Queen
                Mother. Before she became Queen she had dipped into ‘Mein
                Kampf’ and had seen through its author, and she advised people
                accordingly. That steadiness was reflected in the contribution
                of Her Majesty and King George VI in the years immediately
                preceding the war and during it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The same courage was displayed more recently
                during the visit of Her Majesty to Northern Ireland in 1983. One
                does not know the full details, but a few days before her visit
                there was a lapse, and her itinerary was stolen from a car.
                However, that did not affect her. She behaved in an entirely
                characteristic way while here and, in order to mingle with the
                crowd, departed from the route that those charged with her
                safety wished her to take.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yesterday, the Prime Minister made an
                interesting reference to the years that she had had and the
                experience that she garnered during them. She lived through the
                time of 20 Prime Ministers and 18 Presidents, and she could
                reminisce to him not just about Churchill and Attlee, but about
                Asquith, Lloyd George and Baldwin. There was a great wealth of
                experience there, which is a characteristic of the monarchy as a
                whole being a non-political expression of national identity and
                one of the few unifying institutions throughout the country.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Her passing will be felt with sadness by many
                people communally across the divide in Northern Ireland. It is
                quite right and appropriate, therefore, that we have this
                opportunity to express our condolences. I appreciate, and I am
                sure that the community as a whole will appreciate, the
                attendance of so many Members here today to mark that.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister (Mr Durkan):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I join with other Members today as party
                leader and Deputy First Minister in formally extending our
                condolences and offering our sincere sympathies to The Queen and
                her family at this sad time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Queen Mother was a remarkable woman of
                great character and sense of duty who carried out her role with
                dedication, commitment and great dignity. The esteem and regard
                in which The Queen Mother was held has been recognised through
                the many expressions of condolence and the tributes that have
                been paid to her by world leaders. The Queen Mother’s sense of
                service, her contribution to public life and the charities that
                she supported such as MENCAP and the NSPCC were significant.
                Many of the tributes of recent days recalled the war years when
                her personal contribution provided a much-needed boost to the
                people of Britain during those dark times. One does not need to
                be British or a royalist to recognise The Queen Mother’s
                position in public life and the esteem and affection in which
                she was held in her nation and beyond.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recognise that the British Royal Family has
                a very special place in the hearts of many people in Northern
                Ireland, and The Queen Mother’s death brings a deep sense of
                loss to them just as her role was a source of great pride to
                them. People who do not endorse the concept of royalty can still
                appreciate the qualities of someone who loved life and
                demonstrated a clear strength of spirit.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.45 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Queen Mother lived her long life to the
                full. Those who knew her well will greatly mourn her passing.
                Many in Ireland shared her love of racing. Several well-known
                politicians on this side of the water — and on this side of
                the House — enjoyed success on the back of The Queen Mother’s
                tips, real or surmised. I extend my sympathy to The Queen Mother’s
                family, friends and many admirers.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a href="#top">TOP</a></p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The House is grateful to you, Mr Speaker, for
                your initiative in calling this meeting. It is most appropriate
                that the House meet as have done the other representative bodies
                of the United Kingdom, so that politicians can express their
                views and pass on their sympathy to Her Majesty The Queen and
                the Royal House. We welcome that opportunity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On behalf of the people whom I represent, I
                resent deeply the slogans that have appeared today on walls in
                certain areas of Belfast, with the words &quot;Royal Family,
                where is your granny now?&quot;. It is preached to us that
                parity of esteem exists here, but there is none in such language
                — it cuts across the idea of parity of esteem. Unionist
                representatives must say that that activity is deeply resented
                and does not reflect the attitude of vast numbers of people on
                both sides of the religious divide. Many Roman Catholics feel,
                too, the sadness and darkness of this day. As the Deputy First
                Minister said, some do not accept the system of the monarchy but
                are prepared to be courteous at such times and admit the
                contribution of royalty and the monarchs of the United Kingdom,
                especially The Queen Mother. I regret that the SDLP was not
                represented in the House of Commons yesterday; however, I am
                glad that its representatives are here today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those who had the privilege of knowing and
                spending time with The Queen Mother could only say that she was
                a most remarkable woman. The Queen Mother’s greatest
                characteristic was her tenacious memory. Ballymena had the
                privilege of receiving a visit from her in the early days, when
                she and her husband opened the town hall there. I was only a
                little boy, not even a teenager, at that time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yesterday, in the House of Commons, the
                Father of the House reminded Members of a meeting that 15 MPs
                had with The Queen Mother on her ninetieth birthday. My wife and
                I had a lengthy conversation with her then. She reminded me of
                her visit to Ballymena and of the town hall that she and her
                husband opened. She also asked me about various businesses in
                Ballymena. At the time of her visit, the town had a flourishing
                linen business. She then asked me whether Ballymena had a
                tobacco business, and I told her that the town was home to
                Gallaher Ltd at Lisnafillan. She said that she had had that in
                her mind when she thought of Ballymena. She had a tenacious
                memory.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was recorded in the House of Commons
                yesterday that The Queen Mother prayed nightly for the people of
                Northern Ireland. That characterises the type of woman that she
                was. There are no other real competitors for the title
                &quot;lady of the century&quot;, because in all aspects, she was
                the lady of the century. She saw the century in and she saw it
                out, and her remarkable keenness and zest for duty were
                staggering.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once, The Queen Mother attended a meeting at
                St Patrick’s Barracks in Ballymena. I spoke to the Royal
                Flight pilot who had flown her there. He said that she did not
                keep to schedules. He had been informed of the time at which she
                must leave Ballymena, but when the plane took off, the first
                thing she said was that she would not keep to the schedule,
                because she thought that she could spend two more hours in
                Ballymena, and she intended to do so. The pilot told her that
                that would be difficult for him, because he had been instructed
                that they should leave Ballymena at 6.00 pm, but she was
                instructing him to leave at 8.00 pm. He told her that he would
                be in trouble. She replied that he could leave the settlement of
                the dispute to her because she was in charge and she would leave
                when she wanted to leave. Therefore, on that occasion she
                lengthened her visit to Ballymena in order to meet many more
                people whom she would not have met otherwise. Her behaviour in
                my constituency mirrors that in all the constituencies that she
                visited, and that was the universal assent of Members from all
                sides who spoke in the House of Commons yesterday.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What a century she lived in — perhaps the
                greatest century of the era after Christ. She was a powerful
                lady who had conquered difficulties and had faced great
                challenges. She experienced many hard parts of life’s rough
                road and endured many bitter sorrows. She displayed remarkable
                heroism during the war years, and she expressed great love and
                sympathy for those who were in need of it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The foundation of The Queen Mother’s power
                was a living faith in Jesus Christ as her Saviour. It was
                remarked in a BBC programme that for her church confirmation she
                chose the hymn</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;I am not ashamed to own my Lord or to
                defend His cause, Maintain the honour of His Word and the glory
                of His cross&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">She had a faith, which she needed in the
                trials, troubles and tribulations that life held for her.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As we look back on The Queen Mother’s life,
                as a nation we can thank God for giving us such a gift. It is
                difficult to think of the kingdom without The Queen Mother. We
                have been left bereft of someone who acted as a tremendous
                cement to the society of our nation. She bound all classes and
                people, who saw in her, and in her dedication to the service of
                the nation, something that inspired them and was a source of
                strength.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The testimony of her life is best expressed
                by an anonymous poem, putting into her mouth these words:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;What does it matter then that I am
                grey,<br>
                That this frail frame has been seized by decay?<br>
                Though silver is my hair, sweet flowers of gold are blooming
                everywhere.<br>
                My heart’s not old.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not think her heart was ever old.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;And so this tenement of crumbling clay<br>
                Is but a hat I rent for one short day.<br>
                Love’s wondrous house in peace waits now for me<br>
                With joys that shall increase eternally.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That sums up well the life, the testimony and
                the contribution that The Queen Mother made to this nation.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to associate my Colleagues and myself
                with the remarks that have been made about The Queen Mother by
                others who have already spoken. It is at times like this that
                people frequently trot out the phrase &quot;This is the end of
                an era&quot;. However, in the case of a life that spanned three
                centuries and was lived so much in the public gaze, it really
                can be said that this is the end of an era for the people of
                this country. The three words that have come to me most often in
                the millions of words that have been written and spoken over the
                past few days have been: history, duty and personality. In a
                life that was in the public gaze for three quarters of a century
                there was an enormous amount of history.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have no personal memories of The Queen
                Mother, but at the weekend I listened as my mother and my aunt
                described how, as small girls, they cajoled my grandfather into
                taking them to Newtownstewart railway station to watch the then
                Duke and Duchess of York arrive on their way to Baronscourt in
                1924. The Queen Mother was already something of a media
                celebrity then, as she had already captured the public attention
                just a few months after her honeymoon. She remained in the
                public gaze and public affection all her life. It was not just
                that she was there —there was her sense of duty, her sense of
                duty towards the family she had married into, the role that was
                thrust on her by the abdication crisis and her behaviour, which
                has been referred to by the First Minister, during the second
                world war and the famous anecdote about not running to Canada
                for safety for herself.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">She carried that through into the post-war
                era when she ceased to be The Queen Consort and became the
                mother of the sovereign. She did not retreat into privacy but
                continued with an active public life. It was in that that the
                warmth of her personality showed through. There have been
                countless anecdotes in recent days as people have talked about
                how they met her, the things she said and the legendary jokes
                about how her staff, who were half her age, could not keep up
                with her. However, it was when she became so popularly known as
                The &quot;Queen Mum&quot; that her personality showed through to
                the post-war generations, to those of us who have no memory of
                her life during the crises of the earlier part of the century.
                Her work with charities, and her informal meetings with
                individuals have all been highlighted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is clear that she will be missed by people
                of all ages in every part of these islands, by those who have
                happy memories of meetings with her at different stages. We send
                our sympathy to Her Majesty The Queen and to all the members of
                the Royal Family at this time.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Boyd:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On behalf of the Northern Ireland Unionist
                Party, I too pay tribute to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth The
                Queen Mother. The Queen Mother was a remarkable woman who was
                respected by millions throughout the world. The people of
                Northern Ireland will remember her with great fondness and
                affection for having visited the Province on many occasions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Queen Mother had a great loyalty to her
                country, a tremendous love of her people and a strong devotion
                to her Christian faith. She was a wonderful, decent person, and
                our nation is much the poorer for her passing. Our thoughts and
                prayers at this sad time are with Her Majesty The Queen and all
                the members of the Royal Family. It is particularly sad for Her
                Majesty to lose her sister and mother within a few weeks of each
                other in this her Golden Jubilee year.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Watson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We in the United Unionist Assembly Party also
                wish to be associated with the tributes being paid in the House
                to the life and service of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth The Queen
                Mother. Unlike others here today, my party Colleagues and I did
                not have the privilege of meeting such a gracious lady. Having
                been born just a few months before her late husband’s death, I
                grew up in the new Elizabethan post-war era and, like many
                others, always regarded The Queen Mother as the grandmother of
                our nation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am reminded of the words of the late
                President John F Kennedy when he said</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Ask not what your country can do for
                you — ask what you can do for your country.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those words epitomise the life of our beloved
                Queen Mother. During that long and inspirational life she was a
                gracious and kindly Queen, and she has left an indelible mark on
                our society. Throughout that remarkable lifespan she served her
                people selflessly and diligently. She was indeed the matriarch
                of the nation, and through her absolute integrity and warmth of
                character and personality she was a tremendous inspiration to
                the British people during the dark days of war and during the
                brighter days too. Her dedication and duty to her family and
                country, to the Commonwealth of Nations and to other countries
                of the world cannot be questioned and will not easily be
                forgotten.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We extend our deepest sympathy to Her Majesty
                The Queen and all members of the Royal Family at this difficult
                time and pray that Almighty God will give them</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for

                heaviness.&quot;</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ervine:</p>
                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is impossible not to be touched by the
                loss of someone so wonderful. In common with Mr Watson I did not
                know The Queen Mother as Queen. You could argue that I did not
                know The Queen Mother at all, other than by way of the things I
                am capable of reading or the stories that appear on television.
                However, to me there seems to have been a benign power, a
                strength and a rock solid stability that all of us, in some way,
                have tapped into as a resource, and none more so than members of
                the Royal Family who have come through a torrid century with
                circumstances not always as they wished them to be. Yet there
                was this tower of strength, this benign, relatively petite woman
                showing all the fortitude and ability to steer her family in the
                right direction as best she could.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, that family in many ways
                epitomises the nation, a nation going through trauma and
                difficulty, having suffered the awfulness of war, the tragedy of
                death and grief and those things that we know and expect from
                the sad and terrible moments in any life — in the life of a
                person, a family or a nation. The Queen Mother saw all those
                things, but she also saw good things. She saw changes in society
                that mean we live longer such as the eradication of smallpox.
                Absolutely destructive and awful things to humankind also
                happened in the lifetime of The Queen Mother. She would have
                seen much political chicanery in our United Kingdom. She would
                also have seen that political chicanery develop through the
                process of violence. One eye would have been on one part of the
                United Kingdom that perhaps suffered from its abnormality more
                than other areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My sense is that through all of that —
                whether we can celebrate it or commiserate about it — there
                was a life that did make a difference. We have heard today about
                duty and the undoubted devoted service that The Queen Mother
                gave to this society. However, hers is not a life to be
                commiserated; it is to be celebrated, because it has reflected
                the life of a nation. That nation loved her deeply. We will
                carry on without her. Our nation is not besmirched by her
                passing; it has been greatly enhanced by her existence.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On behalf of the Women’s Coalition, I pay
                tribute to The Queen Mother. It is a sad occasion for many
                people, especially The Queen who has lost her sister and her
                mother within such a short period and for the close family
                circle, the grandchildren and great-grandchildren who will miss
                The Queen Mother very much. It is a sad occasion for those who
                knew her well and for the many millions of people whose hearts
                she touched. Our thoughts are with them at this time, and as we
                say in Northern Ireland, we are sorry for their trouble.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like the death of President Kennedy, Princess
                Grace and Princess Diana, the passing of The Queen Mother will
                be captured as a moment in time. People will ask each other:
                &quot;Where were you when you heard?&quot;. Many people will
                remember the mundane things they were doing at the time —
                washing the car or peeling the potatoes. Suddenly, those things
                will take on a new significance as the stories are told and
                retold and history becomes reality.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, The Queen Mother’s death was very
                different from that of President Kennedy, Princess Grace and
                Princess Diana. Their deaths were tragic because they were cut
                down in their prime. The Queen Mother passed away having lived
                her life to the full: that is how she will be remembered. She
                was a strong, capable woman who for many people embodied the
                spirit of royalty. She had grace, glamour and good humour. She
                had dignity and a remarkable sense of duty. She was without
                doubt a true woman of substance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the past few days we have heard many
                stories — and we will hear many more — about her resilience
                during the war years. We have heard about her support for her
                husband The King; her work for charities; her love of horses and
                her dislike of change. However, she saw more change during her
                lifetime than there has been at any other time in the history of
                the world. Many examples of that change have been cited, but
                perhaps the most appropriate for me, as a representative of the
                Northern Ireland Women’s Coalition, to mention is that
                although she was born into privilege she did not have the right
                to vote until she was 28 years old — because she was a woman.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been said that her death marks the end
                of an era. The door of twentieth-century Britain has been
                closed. However, before it did so, The Queen Mother had the
                chance to glimpse the new millennium with her family at her
                side. Sadly she had to witness the death of her daughter before
                she herself passed away. It is right to say that the next few
                days should be a celebration of her life. She lived to see a
                hundred and one summers, and she died peacefully in the
                springtime of her one-hundred-and-second year. What more could a
                family have asked for.</p>
