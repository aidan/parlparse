                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Members and
                those outside should understand what has happened here today. I
                tabled an amendment, which you assured me was competent.
                However, it has not been accepted. You explained the reason that
                it was not accepted. That should be made known to the House and
                to the public.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An amendment was tabled in the name of Dr
                Paisley. I have advised him, and I advise the House, that in
                exercising the responsibilities devolved to me under Standing
                Order 15, it will not be my practice on this occasion, nor will
                it be my intention on any future occasion, to select an
                amendment to a motion of condolence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yesterday I received from the acting First
                Minister and the acting Deputy First Minister the following
                letter dated 12 September 2001:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;In view of the deeply tragic events
                yesterday in the US, we hereby give notice under Standing Order
                11 that the Assembly should meet as soon as possible for the
                purpose of the transaction of the following specific business:-</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That this Assembly condemns the shocking and
                inhuman acts of terrorism carried out in the United States of
                America on Tuesday and, on behalf of the people of Northern
                Ireland, extends its deepest sympathy to the Government and
                people of the United States of America and all who have suffered
                so grievously.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today’s sitting is in pursuance of that
                request under Standing Order 11.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is with warm but undoubtedly heavy hearts
                that we welcome to the Assembly on her first official visit as
                the new United States consul general, Barbara Stephenson.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We trust that there will be happier times
                when she will be able to be with us.</p>

                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That this Assembly condemns the shocking and
                inhuman acts of terrorism carried out in the United States of
                America on Tuesday and, on behalf of the people of Northern
                Ireland, extends its deepest sympathy to the Government and
                people of the United States of America and all who have suffered
                so grievously.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker and Members of the House, we meet
                today under a heavy cloud to express sympathy and to show
                solidarity with the United States and its people. As you
                indicated, Mr Speaker, we have invited Barbara Stephenson to
                attend our proceedings. In the midst of what must be a most
                harrowing and painful time for her and her colleagues, we are
                grateful that her party can be with us today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps the most disturbing fact about the
                events of the last two days is that the passage of time has
                served only to heighten awareness of the enormity of what has
                taken place. The impressions of catastrophe created by the
                terrorist attack on the United States have not lessened as the
                clock has ticked by; rather its implications have become more
                stark, more horrible and more traumatic. Make no mistake about
                it, Western democracy, Western freedoms and Western values are
                under an attack of the most extreme, most cynical and most
                murderous kind.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a politician I have worked towards the day
                when I might play a part in promoting commerce and generating
                wealth in this country to make it a better, more prosperous
                place for our citizens. As a Minister with responsibilities and
                interests in international trade and investment, I was
                devastated to watch what was taking place at the heart of world
                business and at the heart of the business world.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The atrocity has touched the lives of many
                innocent people around the globe. This morning the Foreign
                Secretary talked about the number of citizens from this country
                who lost their lives in Manhattan. The confirmed figure is
                approaching 100, but it is feared that hundreds more of our
                fellow citizens also perished in this cowardly attack.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People from Northern Ireland have been caught
                up in this harrowing maelstrom. We do not know if any have lost
                their lives, nor do we know how many were fortunate to escape.
                All of us thank God that so many were saved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My ministerial Colleague Michael McGimpsey
                knows only too well the sense of relief that a family
                experiences when a loved one telephones to say that he or she is
                all right. Michael’s nephew Jason is a fireman in New York and
                was in the north tower searching for survivors on the nineteenth
                floor when the south tower was attacked. Jason managed to get
                out in time before the huge skyscraper collapsed. Regrettably,
                250 of his colleagues were not so fortunate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People in Northern Ireland know only too well
                what it means to have to endure terrorist violence. Yesterday’s
                attack on the RUC in Londonderry demonstrated that terrorists on
                this island are also intent on inflicting pain and suffering. As
                world leaders begin to face up to international terrorism, it is
                worth remembering the words of the United States Secretary of
                State, General Colin Powell:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We are building a strong coalition to
                go after these perpetrators, but more broadly go after terrorism
                wherever we find it in the world.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those are strong words, and words that I
                wholly endorse.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given our experiences, it is worth reminding
                the House of a simple truth. As stated in ‘The Irish News’
                editorial:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;In moral terms, attacks on Canary Wharf
                in London and the World Trade Centre differ only in terms of
                scale.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not propose to dwell on that now, but we
                must acknowledge the read-across to our situation, which we will
                address in the coming days.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tomorrow, meanwhile, we will officially
                remember our American friends as they attempt to come to terms
                with their loss and to mourn. It will be a time to stand side by
                side with President Bush and the American people and present a
                defiant face to those people who would threaten basic freedoms
                and the democratic way of life. It will be a time to recognise
                our duty to our friends and to stand by the side of right.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Acting Deputy First Minister (Mr Mallon):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker, it is with a very heavy heart
                that I rise to speak on the motion in the name of Sir&nbsp;Reg&nbsp;Empey
                and myself. The horror and the scale of the destruction visited
                on the United States of America on Tuesday has shocked us all.
                It is a horror that will burn in our minds for many, many years
                to come. Our hearts go out not only to those affected but to all
                the people of America who have suffered physically and
                psychologically from the impact of these horrendous acts of
                terrorism.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey and I have written to the
                President of the United States offering the sympathy of the
                Executive. We are grateful to Barbara Stephenson, US consul
                general, and her colleagues for their presence today to hear at
                first hand the views of the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our prayers are with the victims of these
                unspeakable atrocities. Many of us have family, close friends
                and acquaintances in New York and Washington. Many people from
                Northern Ireland have found new lives in America. American
                investment has been very important in creating employment and
                opportunity here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This was not simply an attack on America; it
                was an indiscriminate attack on a centre of world commerce used
                and staffed by people of all nationalities. It was an attack on
                us all. Many of us can recall parades on St Patrick’s Days and
                on other occasions that included members of the New York City
                Police Department and the New York City Fire Department —members
                of all nationalities. We pay tribute to their heroism in the
                face of this outrage, a heroism that has seen all too many of
                them perish in their endeavour to save lives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As part of a society that hopes to emerge
                from conflict, we have some understanding of the American people’s
                feelings at this time. Just as they have supported us in so many
                ways as the peace process has developed, so we should now offer
                them our support in coming to terms with their pain and loss.
                Their solidarity, most notably in the aftermath of the horror of
                Omagh, is a fine example of the way in which friends from other
                nations can help in times of great distress. It is an example
                that we should seek to respond to now as the American people
                face a time of great loss.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For other reasons, the events in America
                touch us all. This unprecedented attack makes the world a less
                safe place. For evil people, advances in civilisation offer a
                new and more horrific means to kill and new opportunities to
                terrorise. That raises the issue of global security. The impact
                of these attacks will reverberate around the world in different
                ways. It is important for democracy that those responsible for
                the planning and organisation of these crimes be brought to
                justice quickly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We ask ourselves what we can do to help. I
                suggest that the greatest tribute and help that we can give, as
                human beings and as leaders of our community, is to ensure that
                terrorism will never again be seen or enacted in our country. We
                must create the stability and the type of progress that alone
                can end and replace the awfulness of terrorism on a global
                scale.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.15 pm</p>
                </i><b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The world has been given a fiercely
                highlighted message through this atrocity that razed a feature
                of New York’s skyline to sea level and made its rubble the
                cruel sepulchre of thousands of unsuspecting victims.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rulers of Western democracies must learn the
                lesson that there cannot be dialogue with terrorism — for it
                is the lie incarnate. Its high priests and acolytes are
                unchangeable liars. They are hellish bloodsuckers, who in these
                crimes were prepared to knife young children to reach their
                heinous ends. Concessions have turned the monster into a greater
                monster, which now rages across the world and comes forward to
                torment us all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A new and terrible dimension has been added
                to the terrors of our unknown tomorrows. We must have firm faith
                in a sovereign God — the only true and living God — who will
                ultimately bring evil to the judgement bar and mete out his
                judgements on those who have committed such dastardly deeds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reference has been made to the Omagh bombing.
                Tragically, the authorities in this land have not brought a
                single person to justice, and the victims have to gather up the
                money to take the case to court. In the past, we have heard
                strong statements in reaction to such terrible deeds as we have
                witnessed, about dealing with evil men and about bringing them
                to justice. However, those reactions have not attained their
                claimed ends. The tragedy is that terrorism has been made
                respectable through concessions. Terrorism has decided that it
                can take on the world and wring more and more concessions out of
                those who abide by democratic principles.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have already had a personal letter
                delivered to President Bush. Today, on behalf of the people I
                represent, I record our sympathy and the brokenness of our own
                hearts, because we too have passed this way. We can only
                continue in the confidence that right will prevail. I speak not
                only for the members of my party, but for the United Unionist
                Assembly Party, which is associating itself with my remarks.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must point out that there are those in the
                House whose organisation is part of the international
                organisation that brought about those awful crimes. There is a
                time to speak and a time to take action. The only action that
                those who believe as I do can take is to withdraw from the House
                while the spokesperson of that organisation, which is allied
                with international terrorism, makes his remarks.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I intend, with my Colleagues, to leave the
                House now. We will return to hear the other Members who wish to
                make a contribution. However, I will not give my presence or
                credence to crocodile tears, or to an impious demonstration of a
                conviction of guilt; a guilt that should be properly expressed
                by handing in the weapons that they have, which are used for the
                same type of killings in our country.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Adams:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two years ago, I visited the north tower of
                the World Trade Centre. Some Irish-American friends, associated
                with Friends of Sinn Féin, who work in the World Trade Centre
                and in the financial district adjacent to it, had organised a
                lunch in the Windows on the World restaurant at the top of the
                tower. Sadly and tragically, one of the people who organised our
                visit is now missing. Friends in New York tell me that there is
                little hope of finding him alive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last night, I spent several hours on the
                phone trying to get through to friends in New York City to
                ensure that they were safe and to hear news of the extent of the
                tragedy. The enormity of the catastrophe is very personal for
                many of them, as it is for me. My telephone conversations will
                be repeated by many Irish people who are reaching out to
                relatives and friends in the USA.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Among those who died was Fr Mychal Judge,
                chaplain of the New York City Fire Department. I met Fr&nbsp;Mychal
                several times. He was a close friend of New York policeman,
                Steven McDonald, who was left a quadriplegic after being shot
                down in the line of duty and who has devoted his life to the
                cause of peace. Steven was at the Assembly only recently.
                Another New York friend of mine, an ex- fireman who has survived
                the tragedy, is coming to terms with the fact that all his
                colleagues in the station have been wiped out.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many people in the Chamber have experienced
                the grief and hurt of loss during the years of our conflict. We
                understand the personal trauma that now touches thousands of
                American homes, and homes in Ireland, Britain and elsewhere in
                the world.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like everyone else in the Assembly, I
                unequivocally condemn those who carried out the attacks. I have
                sent my deepest condolences and sympathy to the people of the
                United States, to President Bush, to Governor Pataki, to Mayor
                Giuliani and to other representatives. It is clear that the
                atrocity will have profound, far-reaching and long-term
                consequences, not just for the victims or for the USA but for
                the rest of the world. Humanity collectively, including people
                on this small island, should be mindful of that in the time
                ahead.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is right that we should express solidarity
                and sympathy with the people of the USA. However, we must go
                further in those essential and necessary expressions of our
                sorrow, shock and denunciation. The best contribution that
                parties represented here — together with the Irish and British
                Goverments — can make to world peace, to the cause of justice
                throughout the world and to the memory of those who died in the
                USA and in other conflicts, including our own, is to make our
                peace process work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When viewed in the awful context of the
                difficulties that other regions are experiencing, together with
                the enormous human suffering in New York and Washington, it is
                true that great progress has been made here. Is that to be
                squandered? We know the issues — they have been well
                rehearsed. I do not challenge only Unionists or the British
                Government by those remarks. There is a collective challenge for
                all of us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our party is totally committed to the peace
                process. I rededicate myself and my Colleagues to do our best to
                resolve the problems that confront us. We share real
                difficulties. I cannot underestimate them, and I do not
                underestimate them. Nor do I suggest that Republicans or
                Nationalists have a monopoly on grievance or problems. However,
                let us realise that our duty is to make peace with one another,
                and that our response to the atrocity is to build democracy and
                justice here and to resist all the factional urges that divide
                us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have still a long way to go to surmount
                our difficulties and to deal with the problems that beset the
                process. If we fail to resolve those problems, we will have
                failed our people — we will have failed ourselves. While we
                absorb, on both a personal and a political level, what has
                happened in the USA, we will have failed to meet the challenge
                and spurned the opportunity, amid the anger, chaos, suffering
                and sorrow, to make a difference and show that a better way
                exists.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs E Bell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although I rise with deep sadness and
                profound regret, I welcome the opportunity to support the
                message of condolence. My deep sadness is a result of the
                thousands of human beings — most still not found or identified
                — who had life snatched from them at the scenes of tragedy.
                The true number of those killed will not be known for a long
                time, if ever, and it will be a harrowing time for their
                colleagues, friends and relatives left behind. We must remember
                — even if it is for our own comfort — that, only minutes
                after the initial explosions, hundreds of firefighters,
                paramedics and other rescue workers entered the burning
                buildings without thought for their own safety. Many of them
                paid the ultimate price for their caring behaviour.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My profound regret is that, even in the
                twenty-first century, man’s inhumanity to man achieved a new
                low with such basic terror. There are men and women who are
                completely guided in all aspects of their lives and their
                behaviour by radical conviction or rabid fanaticism. They
                sincerely believe that the end justifies the means, even though
                their other beliefs specifically preach the value of life and
                the evil of taking it. I remember all too clearly, as others
                will, that in our own dark times a number of terrorist
                organisations stated that, unfortunately and in some instances,
                even children’s lives were expendable. We have not really
                learned.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The public was naturally horrified. However,
                that attitude is obviously still present in those groups that
                use terror and murder as the chief weapons in their struggle —
                even in Northern Ireland. Here we have witnessed graphic
                horrors, such as Darkley, Enniskillen, McGurk’s Bar, La Mon
                House Hotel and, ultimately, Omagh. Each of those caused a new
                wave of revulsion, but the scenes from New York and Washington
                have undoubtedly resulted in even greater disbelief and absolute
                disgust because of the scale of what happened.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must show our support and sympathy to the
                people of America, as they have done to us so many times in the
                past. I ask President Bush and other world leaders to spare no
                effort to seek out the perpetrators and their supporters, but I
                also ask them to react in a measured way and not to retaliate on
                the same scale. That would only mean further loss of innocent
                life. Seek justice, not revenge.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like others, I have watched the almost
                24-hour coverage of the horror and tragedy in the United States.
                In many ways, anything that I say or that is likely to be said
                will by now be clichés, as so many people have poured out their
                condemnation, anger, frustration and disbelief.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are moments in life — and this has to
                be one of them — when those of us in our divided society who
                have suffered from terrorism or who have felt that they were
                freedom fighters must consider where we are now and what
                contribution we can make to our lives and the lives of those
                around us in the future.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are few words that I could say to
                reassure people that they are not in danger. It is one thing to
                think that you might have the capacity to protect yourself, and
                another to launch attacks on innocent people. Terror can be on a
                small or a large scale. We must remember that the United States
                has suffered both, when terrorists murdered its citizens in
                Tanzania, Kenya, Beirut and throughout the world. However,
                whether terror is on the small scale, or on the spectacular and,
                frankly, bloody awful scale that we see now, the outcome is the
                same.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can anyone imagine what is was like to be
                herded to the back of a plane in the knowledge that, as the New
                York or Washington skyline rose to meet you, you were breathing
                your last breath? Is that any different from having a 9mm pistol
                put to your head and finding, in those last fleeting moments,
                that you are breathing your last breath?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker, I have a personal sense of hurt
                and anger about what we have seen. Terrorism is wrong; it is
                unjustifiable. As another Member said, our contribution to the
                future should be to ensure that our little bit of world peace is
                helped by our recognising that, although we want to be safe,
                there is no excuse for making an attack.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we are in shock here in Northern Ireland,
                we can only begin to imagine how people in Pittsburgh,
                Washington, New York and throughout the United States must feel.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Barbara Stephenson must have been in a
                terrible state on Tuesday, because I understand that she has
                children in Washington. We made our telephone calls to ensure
                that any friends and relatives that we have in America were
                safe, that they had managed to scoop up their children, take
                them from their schools and homes, and get to safety. To have
                heard the telephone calls of people who are concerned about the
                many who are still missing, we in the Assembly can only express
                our deepest condolences.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This was cruelty of the most volcanic
                proportions and it has shaken the geopolitics of the world. All
                we can think about is how we, in our humanity, can reach out to
                all those Americans who throughout the years have reached out to
                us with humanity, time and time again.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As we once said, the Americans never had to
                send soldiers to Northern Ireland or bring bodies home in body
                bags. They sent us diplomats, community workers, academics and
                funding. We thank them for that. All we can say is that, in this
                moment of their terrible horror, we shall give them anything
                that they ask of us. That is the least that we can do in our
                humanity. We shall also remember them as the weeks go on.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the end, we must redouble our efforts to
                find democratic, anti-oppressive methods to deal with
                differences, both in our own very small part of the world and
                throughout the world.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like Barbara Stephenson to know that
                — as we say in Northern Ireland — we are very sorry for your
                trouble.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I extend my profound sympathy to the
                President and people of the United States. Events of such
                horrific magnitude make language inadequate to express our
                empathy and solidarity with those who suffer. The words of Colin
                Powell and the resolution of the United Nations Security Council
                to combat all terrorism, wherever it may be, must bring some
                sense of belief that, following this enormously tragic event,
                the world has at last awakened to the fact that the third world
                war, which began long ago, is reaching a new level of horror.
                This horrific outrage outlines the principle that my party and I
                have always contended: democracy cannot co-exist with terrorism.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no difference in principle between
                the outrages of the Baltic Exchange, Canary Wharf, Manchester,
                Thiepval and the present catastrophe in New York; the difference
                is in the scale. Their purpose and effect are exactly the same
                — to induce, by terror, policy adoption by the nation that
                suffers, whether it be the United States or the United Kingdom.
                The purpose is to force nations to adopt policies that are
                conducive to the realisation of terrorist aims.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ETA, Libya, Colombia and the Balkans have all
                inflicted terror that was internationally organised, and people
                in this part of the world have played a central part in that. My
                refusal to countenance any kind of political intercourse with
                the political representatives of armed terrorists of whatever
                kind, colour or persuasion has been criticised by the so-called
                liberals of political life in Northern Ireland as rigid,
                implacable and unbending. However, there can be no point of
                compromise between the arsonist and the fireman — and many
                firemen died, discharging their duty in New York. Nor can there
                be any point of compromise between the democrat and the
                terrorist.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Republican movement’s contributions to
                terrorism in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries have been
                the car bomb, which decimated American citizens in Beirut and in
                their embassies in east Africa, and the more recent concept of
                attacking the commercial heartland of the country that
                terrorists wish to persuade to follow policies that will realise
                their terrorist aims. In the commercial and media heart of
                London are the Baltic Exchange and Canary Wharf, just as New
                York had the twin towers of the World Trade Centre. The bitter
                lesson of London was learned by those who perpetrated the
                outrage in New York. However, the British Government were
                willing to follow a policy of abject appeasement to protect the
                mainland. We did not hear the kind of words that came from Colin
                Powell from a British Minister. We did not hear a British
                Minister say that the Government would hunt down terrorists and
                eradicate them wherever they were found.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I deliberately stayed to hear what Mr Adams
                had to say, although my sympathies were with those who left. Mr
                Adams held a position in the Belfast brigade of the IRA when it
                blew apart the bodies of 11 people on Bloody Friday. I treat his

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. There can be no one in the Chamber who
                has not had to be present in places of sadness and at funerals.
                Most of us are aware that more words spoken do not necessarily
                mean more condolences expressed. It is time to express our
                condolences in ways other than in words.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Question put and agreed to nemine
                contradicente.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Resolved:</p>
                </i></font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That this Assembly condemns the shocking and
                inhuman acts of terrorism carried out in the United States of
                America on Tuesday and, on behalf of the people of Northern
                Ireland, extends its deepest sympathy to the Government and
                people of the United States of America and all who have suffered
                so grievously.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have arranged for a book of condolence to
                be made available for Members, staff and press working in the
                Building or on the Stormont estate who wish to sign it. I invite
                Sir Reg Empey, Mr Séamus Mallon and other Members who wish to
                sign the book to do so with me in the Chamber after the
                Adjournment. The book will then be made available in the Great
                Hall for Members’ staff, party staff, Assembly officials,
                civil servants and others who work on the estate, and the press
                corps.</p>
