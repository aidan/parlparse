      <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="1"></a>Matters of the Day</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading">Murder of Kieran Doherty</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Mr Mark Durkan has sought leave to make a statement on a matter that fulfils  the criteria set out in Standing Order 24. I shall call Mr Durkan to speak for  up to three minutes on the subject. I will then call representatives from each  of the other parties, as agreed with the Whips. Those Members will each have up  to three minutes in which to speak on the matter. There will be no opportunity  for interventions, questions or a vote on the matter. I will not take any  points of order until the item of business is concluded. If that is clear, we  will proceed.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  Last week, the Real IRA murdered a young man, Kieran Doherty, in Derry. Mr Speaker, the House has always used the facility  that you have granted today to show its unity and determined purpose in  rejecting those who seek to use violence in the name of any cause in our  society. It is important that all parties use this opportunity to reinforce the  strong, united condemnation that has come from right across the community in  Kieran Doherty&rsquo;s home city. It is important that we reject the pretensions of  those who believe that they can act as judge, jury and executioner over anyone,  who believe that they can arrogate the right to determine life and death for  anyone, who pretend that they can act in the name of our country, and who  pretend that they are pursuing some pure cause with those deadly means.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Real IRA not only murdered Kieran Doherty, it murdered  him in a ruthless, callous and brutal manner. That organisation has sought to  say various things about and against that young man, and his family has asked  me and other elected representatives to place on record their utter rejection  of the allegations and insinuations that have been made against their son,  brother and partner.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Doherty&rsquo;s family also want us to record their total  rejection of what the Real IRA has done and claims to stand for, and to raise  the very genuine concerns that they have about the latter months of Kieran&rsquo;s  life, when they say that he was being subjected to particular harassment,  pursuit and pressure by MI5 agents. They have serious questions about how much  those people know about the circumstances of Kieran&rsquo;s death and how much their  involvement may have conditioned his death. Those questions will have to be  pursued through other channels on other occasions, but it is right and proper  that those questions are raised, out of respect for a grieving family and the  community in Derry that stands in solidarity  with them.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  Mr Kieran Doherty was murdered by the Real IRA in Londonderry  last week. Whatever involvement Mr Doherty may or may not have had in any  paramilitary organisation confers no legitimacy whatsoever on his killers. Our  thoughts and prayers are with his family at this time.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That type of killing is all too reminiscent of the  activities carried out by the Provisional IRA during its 30 years of violence.  The same area of Londonderry was used in  similar circumstances in the early days of the Troubles, when two innocent  Protestant civilians, one of whom I knew, were murdered in very much the same  fashion. It was wrong then and it is wrong now.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Some have talked as though the security services were as  responsible as those who carried out the murder. However, the Assembly must be  absolutely clear that the blame lies with those who put two bullets into Mr  Doherty&rsquo;s head.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Considerable reference has been made to incidents such as  this dragging us back to the bad old days. However, that can only happen if, in  the wider community, we allow those who carry out those atrocities to get away  with it. Information is vital and it must be given to the police so that the  guilty can be caught. It is only when the guilty are in a place where they  cannot carry out those activities and are unable to carry them out again that  we will remain in the place where we are at the moment, and, hopefully, these  days will be a dim, distant and painful past.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I begin by offering my deepest  sympathy to Kieran&rsquo;s partner, Mairead, and the Doherty, Millar and Coyle  families who are mourning the loss of their son, partner and brother, Kieran  Doherty.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">On behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in, I totally and absolutely condemn  the murder of this young Derry father, and I  appeal to anyone with information about the murder to come forward and assist  the investigation. Having spoken to Kieran&rsquo;s family over the weekend, I know  that they want justice to be sought for Kieran&rsquo;s murder. They have asked me,  Martin McGuinness, Mark Durkan and others to refute the allegations that have  been made against Kieran, and they are seeking answers to the linkage between  the group that calls itself the Real IRA and MI5.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is widespread revulsion in Derry at the murder of  this young Derry man. I attended his wake over  the weekend and the removal this morning with my colleague Raymond McCartney,  and people were asking questions about the rationale and motivation of Kieran&rsquo;s  killers.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is generally believed that the organisation is not only  infiltrated by MI5 but by criminals, and their activities are anathema to Irish  republicans. Even those who gave tacit support in the past, small in number as  they are, now accept that. However, today our thoughts should be with Mairead  and the wider family circle.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I was called to the scene after the murder, and I want to  ensure that people know that we extend our deepest sympathy to the family and  friends of the victim, and to the wider Derry  community, as they come to terms with this very sad loss. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith  agat.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  On behalf of the Ulster Unionist Party, I convey, in the strongest possible  terms, our condolences to the family of Kieran Doherty. There is considerable  merit in Mr Durkan&rsquo;s call for the House to show unanimity of purpose, and I was  heartened to hear the position adopted by the First Minister and the deputy  First Minister, among others.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The people of Northern Ireland have a choice.  They can either look forward to the rule of law and order and to peaceful  co-existence or risk going back to the bad old days. It is perhaps unfortunate  &mdash; I apologise in advance &mdash; that politics should come into what is such a tragic  event, but such events take place against a backdrop of certain political  events. Those Members who are looking forward to being Minister for justice  should not underestimate the challenges that tragic events are likely to place  on the House. They should seek to build consensus and to deal with matters in a  way that suits all the people.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Of those who use such activities in Londonderry  for political aims, in order to advocate some particular stance, I ask what  sort of country they want us to live in. Is it the sort of country where there  is summary justice, a most brutal murder, and people are given no chance to  defend themselves? That is surely no form of political nirvana.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, there has been some discussion about the role of  the security forces and the PSNI in what happened. PSNI officers belong to  probably the most overseen force in the entire world. The benefit of having the  Policing Board and other institutions is that allegations that have been made  will be investigated and, I am quite sure, will not be substantiated. The way  forward for Northern Ireland  &mdash; I hope that Mr Doherty&rsquo;s death plays some part in our achieving this &mdash; is to  adhere to the rule of law and order. Only then can we make any progress.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: My  party is grateful for the opportunity to comment on this most tragic of  incidents. It is, first, a loss of life: that of Kieran Doherty&rsquo;s life in Derry. It is a loss to his family and his partner, to  whom he was about to be married. A child who is about to be born has lost its  father. It was a most brutal murder and is as far away as possible that one can  conceive from the concept of justice in this society.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Doherty was an innocent man, and the record will reflect  that, but even if the allegations had any legitimacy, there is only one police  service in this society. There is only one prosecution service, only one  judicial system and only one rule of law. We have worked to bring this society  to that point over the past number of years, and it is where this society needs  to stay. The Assembly needs to express that message very clearly. There is no  scope for any individual or organisation to assume the roles of judge, jury and  executioner. There is no concept of internal housekeeping, if there ever was.  There can be no concept of an individual&rsquo;s being treated as a pawn in some  wider game. We have to respect every individual and his or her human rights,  and there is no more important human right than the right to life, which has  clearly been violated in this case.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that the Assembly sends a united political  message and does not play into the hands of those who are seeking to bring this  society back.</p>

      <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="2"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading">Public Expenditure: &nbsp;February Monitoring 2009-2010</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice from the Minister of Finance and Personnel that he  wishes to make a statement.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr S Wilson)</strong>: With your permission, Mr Speaker, I  wish to make a statement regarding the outcome of the February monitoring  round, following the Executive meeting on Thursday 25 February 2009.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is the fourth and final monitoring round of the  2009-2010 financial year. The need to manage the overall financial position to  protect the integrity of the Executive and the Northern Ireland block by ensuring  that we do not over&shy;spend against the amounts available to us has been our  priority throughout the year and remains so.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As Members will be aware, given the constraints of the  spring Supplementary Estimates (SSEs) and the simple logistical challenge of  processing additional spend at this late stage in the year, the February  monitoring round does not usually give rise to significant allocations. It is  for that reason that we continually emphasise to Departments the importance of  identifying and surrendering reduced requirements as early as possible in the  year.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, it is extremely disappointing that Departments  have declared reduced requirements of &pound;19&middot;3 million of current expenditure and  &pound;11&middot;9 million of capital investment in the February monitoring round, with some  Departments surrendering material amounts. Although some of those easements  undoubtedly arose because of factors outside of the Departments&rsquo; control, it  appears that some of them could have surrendered money earlier in the year if  they had displayed better financial management and forecasting.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, the Department of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety (DHSSPS) has surrendered a further &pound;16&middot;2 million of current  expenditure from the swine flu funding that was made available to it in  September 2009. Combined with the &pound;4 million that that Department surrendered  in the December monitoring round, it has surrendered a total of &pound;20&middot;2 million  out of an allocation of &pound;27&middot;9 million. Again, it is disappointing that that  easement has been identified so late in the financial year. Members may recall  that the original allocation was made to DHSSPS on the basis that any funding  that was not required would be returned to the contributing Departments.  Therefore, it is even more concerning that that funding is being returned at  such a late stage in the year, meaning that instead of donor Departments being  able to use the resources in question, there is a risk of losing the funding,  at least in the short run, to our Treasury-controlled end-year flexibility  (EYF) stock. Indeed, donor Departments have confirmed that out of the total  easement of &pound;16&middot;2 million, they will be able to spend only &pound;2&middot;7 million by the  end of the year.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The &pound;2&middot;7 million will be returned to the Departments that  indicated that they will be able to spend it this year. However, to ensure  fairness for all Departments, who responded so positively to the DHSSPS call  for swine flu funding, the Executive have agreed that the balance of &pound;13&middot;4  million should be retained by DHSSPS this year and be transferred from DHSSPS  to the contributing Departments in the June monitoring round in 2010-11. As  well as ensuring that Departments that contributed to swine flu funding are not  being penalised unfairly, that approach will allow DHSSPS to address a pressure  that it has identified in the area of elective care.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive have also agreed to make allocations to  Departments for the funding that is required for the equal pay claim. Members  will recall that headroom was incorporated in the spring Supplementary  Estimates for that purpose. The formal proposal that was made to NIPSA gave  rise to a liability that must be provided for in the departmental resource  accounts in 2009-2010, and, therefore, Budget cover is required. However,  changes in the treatment of provisions under the Treasury&rsquo;s alignment (clear  line of sight) project mean that any provisions that are taken up in 2009-2010  will, in effect, cause a double hit on our departmental expenditure limits.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In light of that, I sought and secured additional non-cash  departmental expenditure limit cover this year from the Treasury. However, the  cost of that will have to be addressed within our departmental expenditure  limit when the payments are made, and that has been factored into the review of  the 2010-11 spending plans.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The agreed settlement can be divided into two distinct  areas: the lump sum settlements and the arrears of pay resulting from the  claim. The payment of the lump sum settlements is dependent on individual  agreement from claimants, and it, therefore, may take a while to process.  However, it is possible to process the arrears element separately, which will  speed up the payments, but a near cash departmental expenditure limit cover of  &pound;29&middot;7 million will be required in 2009-2010 to do so. To facilitate that and to  offset that pressure, the Executive agreed to use &pound;26&middot;5 million of Barnett  consequentials from the 2009 Budget. That will allow those payments to be  processed in March 2010, and the residual &pound;3&middot;2 million will be addressed from  the reduced requirements that are surrendered in this round.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I now turn to the bids that Departments have submitted in  this round. As I mentioned earlier, the capacity to make allocations in the  February round is restricted by the spring Supplementary Estimates as well as  the ability to spend additional allocations so late in the year. However, as  Members will recall, a limited amount of headroom was built into the SSEs to  facilitate allocations should resources become available. The &pound;9&middot;2 million  current expenditure bids that Departments submitted in the February monitoring  round reflect the headroom that is incorporated into the SSEs.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Given the relatively high level of reduced requirements  surrendered in this round, the Executive agreed to meet all the current  expenditure bids that were submitted. Thus, the Department of Agriculture and  Rural Development (DARD) receives &pound;2&middot;3 million to address the pressure arising  from the EU&rsquo;s disallowance of area aids for the claim for single farm payments  from 2004-06, and the &pound;5 million to the Department of Health, Social Services  and Public Safety is the final instalment of its &pound;20 million first call on  available resources, which was agreed as part of the Budget 2008-2011  settlement. The Department for Social Development (DSD) receives &pound;1 million for  the special purchase of evacuated dwellings (SPED) scheme. Members may recall  that, on 10 September 2009, the Executive agreed to additional flexibilities to  allow the Minister for Social Development to manage pressures arising from that  scheme, and that &pound;1 million reflects the residual pressure that remains  unaddressed. Finally, &pound;0&middot;1 million goes to the Northern Ireland Audit Office  for the provision of early retirement.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Departments did not submit any capital investment bids in  this round. However, given the availability of &pound;5&middot;5 million of capital investment,  my officials revisited the matter with them. As a result, I am pleased to  announce a capital allocation of &pound;5&middot;5 million to the Department of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety. That funding will allow the Department to  address a range of priority needs across the trusts, including equipment,  medical devices, vehicles, specialised services, IT and estates. The details of  those allocations, the return of swine flu contributions and the equal pay  allocations are included in table 4, which is attached to my statement.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition to the changes already outlined, and to  facilitate sound financial management in Departments, the Executive have also  allowed Departments to move resources across spending areas. That is permitted  when the movement is reflective of a proactive management decision that is  taken to enable the Department concerned to manage emerging pressures within  its existing baselines. Departments are to be commended for their actions to  address their pressures in that way.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It has also been necessary, due largely to technical  issues, to reclassify some amounts between different categories of expenditure.  Details of those changes are also provided in the tables that are attached to  my statement. The consequence of those actions is that the Executive conclude  the February monitoring round with an overcommitment of &pound;8&middot;3 million for  current expenditure and no overcommitment for capital investment. Given the low  level of underspend that Departments returned last year, that represents a  realistic and sensible position with which to conclude the year. However, I  emphasise the importance of each and every Department taking action to ensure  that its spending does not exceed the levels that the Executive agreed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">An overspend by one Department could put the Northern Ireland  block grant at risk. Although we must aim to minimise underspend and to  maximise the use of available resources, that should not be done at the expense  of proper financial controls.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I remind the House that the purpose of the  in-year monitoring process is to help the Executive to make the most of the  resources at their disposal. Although some may say otherwise, that is exactly  what the Executive have achieved in 2009-2010. In the more constrained  financial position facing us this year, the Executive have, through the in-year  monitoring process, addressed significant pressures, including those that arose  from the deferral of domestic water charging and the shortfall in capital  receipts, as well as making significant additional allocations to Departments.  In addition, we are concluding the final monitoring round of the year with a  realistic level of overcommitment that will protect the integrity of the block  grant. Therefore, I commend the February monitoring position to the Assembly.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel (Ms J McCann)</strong>: Go raibh maith  agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his statement. He indicated  that he was extremely disappointed at the late declaration of reduced requirements  by some Departments. It seems that scope still exists for improving the  financial management and forecasting of those Departments.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">What pre-emptive steps can be taken to ensure that reduced  requirements are declared at the earliest opportunity? Has the Minister given  any further thought to establishing incentives or sanctions for Departments in  that regard?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I re-emphasise my disappointment that four  Departments gave over 50% of their total reduced requirements for the year in  the February monitoring round. There are constant checks with Departments to  try to ensure that they are managing their budgets. However, we have to rely on  Departments and Ministers to come forward with information. If my officials and  I were to delve into every line of a Department&rsquo;s budget, there would be uproar  about us trying to run Departments.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Co-operation between Departments and my Department, and  between Ministers and me, is required. For example, in the last week of  January, the Health Department was telling us that it would have &pound;5 million of  money for swine flu to give back, a figure that rose to &pound;16&middot;5 million by the  first week in February. There is work to be done in the Department in that  regard.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson asked what sanctions can be imposed on  Ministers, and I suppose that the sanctions are twofold. Such issues are  debated in the Executive, and Ministers who consistently show that they are not  managing budgets well will find it more difficult to persuade Executive colleagues  that additional moneys should be given to them, especially if, at the end of  the year, they are responsible for money that could have been allocated  elsewhere and spent better in the middle of the year. Where there are  overspends or severe underspends, we could consider imposing penalties on the  Departments involved, especially when money is lost as a result of an  underspend.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  welcome the statement, particularly the reference to the ability to process  arrears for equal pay claims.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I share the Chairperson&rsquo;s concerns about the scale of the  late declarations of underspend by a range of Departments. I am particularly  concerned by the amount of money that the Health Department had to hand back,  especially the money for swine flu, which contrasts sharply with what the  Department was saying only a short time ago. What discussions has the Minister  had with the Health Department about the amount of money that it handed back  due to the swine flu situation?</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: That question is perhaps linked to the Committee  Chairman&rsquo;s question. The level of underspend or the amount of money that was  given back as a reduced requirement could have been substantially higher had it  not been for my officials&rsquo; work with the Department of Health, Social Services  and Public Safety. We must not forget that, in June and July 2009, I was  pilloried because the Health Minister demanded &pound;77 million to tackle swine flu.  As a result of probing by my officials, that figure was reduced to &pound;64<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; ">&middot;</span>7 million and, eventually, to &pound;45  million. Therefore, work at an early stage ensured that we did not take a pile  of extra money from Departments. In fact, we took the minimum amount. However,  when approximately &pound;27 million is allocated, it is disappointing that &pound;20<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; ">&middot;</span>2 is given back at the end of the  year.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said in response to a previous question, we did not  simply sit back and wait for the DHSSPS to outline a figure. My officials asked  questions and, in the final week of January 2010, were told that &pound;5 million  would be returned. However, in the first week of February, they were told that  the final figure was &pound;16<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; ">&middot;</span>2  million. We discussed the matter at the Executive, and, oddly enough, I was  told that the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) had told the  Minister that the threat had been downgraded in December 2009. However, we did  not discover until February 2010 that &pound;16<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; ">&middot;</span>2  million was to be handed back.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Dallat] in the Chair)</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers must manage their budgets, but they must also be  team players. Money that is not spent from one budget could be spent in plenty  of other areas. Therefore, Ministers cannot act as if money belongs to their  Department only and that that is the end of the story. They must recognise that  there are implications: if that &pound;16<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; ">&middot;</span>2  million had been available in the December monitoring round, the Minister of  Education could have spent it all.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Does the Minister accept that this monitoring round suggests that he will  reduce the overcommitment and increase the level of unspent resources? He  mentioned &ldquo;team players&rdquo;: does he accept my party&rsquo;s view that the Executive are  dysfunctional?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Some Departments, rather than the whole Executive,  might be regarded as dysfunctional. It does not help them to function well when  Ministers play lone games such as those that I described.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member asked about the level of overcommitment. I do  not know whether he read the statement: we have reduced the level of  overcommitment in light of experience. Last year, the Executive spent 99<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; ">&middot;</span>7% of their budget as opposed to  the 97% that they spent two years previously. Therefore, Departments are, by  and large, managing their expenditure better. There is no point in having a  huge level of overcommitment. In fact, we would be mad to have a huge level of  overcommitment, given that we know that Departments have been spending almost  100% of their budgets. We must not forget that the Treasury will penalise us  severely if we spend more than has been allocated.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The end-year result has not been the only guiding line. If  we look at Departments&rsquo; anticipated spending compared with their actual spend,  we can see that the December figures show that, two years ago, the difference  was approximately 2&middot;9% whereas it had decreased to approximately 0&middot;8% last  year. Therefore, planned spending and actual spending have been coming closer  and closer together. The level of underspend has been reduced for good, sound,  prudent reasons in the light of that kind of experience. I would have been far  more open to criticism had I simply thrown out a huge amount of overspend only  to find that, by encouraging Departments to keep on spending because the  overspend facility existed, we finished up in jeopardy with the Treasury.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  There have to be concerns about the financing of the swine flu issue, and I am  sure that the Health Committee will take that up. However, I want to ask the  Minister about the equal pay issue. His explanation was complex. Will he  confirm that the revised pay scales for all grades will be in place and that  payments will be made, including those for the related short period of arrears,  in March pay packets? Furthermore, have any of the lump sum back payments been  made in this financial year, and, if they are to run into next year, when does  he expect them to be paid? Will he accept that that is an urgent matter?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: We expect the back pay to be paid by the end of this  month, and we provided for that. The lump sums issue is complex because all  13,000 people affected have to be interviewed. We took steps to put a structure  in place once we knew that we were moving towards a settlement. I cannot give a  total commitment as to when the lump sum issue will be resolved, but, as I have  said in the House before, the Treasury allowed us money that my predecessor had  negotiated for. I met the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, and we are being  allowed to carry over that money to next year. However, I doubt that we would  be allowed to carry it over for a further year.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not want to stretch the issue out for a year, however,  and all the indications are that we should be able to pay the lump sums by  August 2010 or in late summer. I am always reluctant to give the Member an  exact date, because I am sure that, if I miss it by a day, he will skewer me in  the House. I assure him that we will seek to pay those lump sums as quickly as  possible, because it is not in our interests to do otherwise. In September  2009, I promised to resolve the situation by Christmas, and we did so, with the  agreement of the unions.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  The Minister mentioned the use of &pound;26&middot;5 million in Barnett consequentials from  the 2009 Budget to offset the equal pay claim. Will he reflect on the fact that  those moneys were generated at a UK level for additional projects that we are  not going to be able to carry out in Northern Ireland, and, although we have  devolution here, does he recognise that that is a missed opportunity?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">What lessons has the Minister learned from the swine flu  episode about how the Executive respond to an in-year crisis, particularly when  that crisis is not as severe as was first predicted? That excludes the lesson  about taking what the Health Minister says with a pinch of salt.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The Member has asked a very odd question. He  usually, at least, sees the logic of the direction in which he takes an  argument, even if he continues to pursue it. The Member has spoken eloquently  about devolution on a number of occasions in the House. With devolution, we get  to choose how we spend the money that is allocated to us. We are not simply  told by Westminster that, because the money is spent on certain purposes in  England, it should be spent on the same purposes in Northern Ireland. As the  Member rightly pointed out, there is a consequence through the Barnett formula  to money being spent in England. That money comes to Northern Ireland for us to  make a decision on how to spend it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Given that we have efficiencies to make next year, we asked  Departments to bring forward to this year any projects on which they wanted to  spend money next year, including those that they thought might be in jeopardy  as a result of the efficiency savings of around &pound;122 million that had to be  made. We asked Departments to do that because we got money from the Barnett  consequentials, and, as a result, any projects that they listed could be worked  on. No such projects were forthcoming. When we knew that that was the case and  when we knew that we would have this pressure and that we would have to address  it this year, we decided to use the Barnett consequential money for such  projects. However, that was not the first choice; the decision was made only  after Departments indicated that they could not bring projects forward from the  next financial year into this year. Therefore, we have decided to allocate that  funding.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">For example, the money for the equal pay settle&shy;ment would  have had to come from somewhere, so using the Barnett consequentials money to  meet that pressure means that we have avoided making cuts or reductions or  taking money from Departments in other ways.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I learned some lessons from the swine flu episode. Whenever  Ministers are faced with a crisis, they should scrutinise any advice that they  are given as rigorously as possible to ensure that they are not overreacting.  If they overreact, there is a financial consequence.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The pressures that existed in September 2009 meant that we  had a fairly difficult monitoring round. In fact, the demands that swine flu  was making of other Departments meant that it took some time to get the  September monitoring round through. Members should not forget that, had it not  been for the caution that my officials exercised, we might have been taking much  more from Departments, given that the Minister of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety wanted &pound;77 million at that time. If there is a lesson to be  learned, it is not just that I took the best scientific advice &mdash; how often have  I heard that phrase &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  No science here.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Perhaps Mr McGimpsey, the Health Minister, should  learn from me that one should not only listen to advice but scrutinise and  question it before coming to a conclusion. It is always good to question some  of the scientific evidence that is offered, regardless of whether it is on  swine flu or on climate change.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Perhaps I should stand up to make my remarks. I remind  Members not to make remarks from a seated position and not to ignore rulings  from the Chair.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. I welcome the additional funding and  support in the monitoring round for the SPED scheme. That is a good example of  the Executive taking decisive action to address a community concern that  unfortunately exists because of some of the circumstances that are prevalent in  our society.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It appears from the Minister&rsquo;s statement that around half  the total that is needed for the equal pay settlement and arrears affects the  Department for Social Development. Some &pound;77 million has been allocated to that  Department in 2009-2010. It is likely that what is happening with the grades  that are affected by the equal pay settlement will have an obvious, ongoing and  disproportionate detrimental effect on that Department. Given that, will the  Minister outline what discussions have been had with that Department to see  whether there can be some flexibility in helping to ease what will obviously be  a very high pressure in the years to come?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I am not sure what the Member means by &ldquo;some  flexibility&rdquo;. I suspect that that is a veiled request to pay the Department for  Social Development&rsquo;s bill for the ongoing equal pay costs. If the Member looks  at the situation in percentage terms, he will see that the number of AAs and  AOs in the Department of Finance and Personnel equates to about the same or  slightly less than the percentage pressure that the Department for Social  Development faces. I do not know the figures off the top of my head, but the  percentage pressures are similar. I accept that some Departments are hit harder  than others. Indeed, that is why the Executive have dealt with the lump sum  element collectively. Departments will have running costs as they go forward,  and they will have to finance those from their own budgets.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">12.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member should reflect on the logic of his question. How  long should the ongoing cost of the equal pay settlement to the Department for  Social Development be carried by other Departments: for ever, for two years or  for five years? Furthermore, if that cost were carried by other Departments,  what incentive would the Minister for Social Development, who I am sure runs  her Department extremely well &mdash; I have to say that anyway, because she is  sitting in the Chamber &mdash; have to ask for a change in her staffing structure or  a different method of delivery? If the costs were underwritten by other  Departments, why should she worry?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a case for saying that a Department should not  carry an unfair burden in respect of the lump sum, but that issue goes back  years, and current Ministers had no responsibility for creating it. It simply  does not make sense to say that we should carry the cost just because one Department  is hit more severely than others. What would be the threshold? Should we bear  the costs only of the Department that is hit hardest? Should we also carry the  expense for a Department that incurs a cost that is just 2% or 3% lower? The  Member&rsquo;s question raises a pile of other questions. Departments have staff  structures that can be changed over time, but Ministers must manage those staff  structures within their own budget.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  statement. Many Members share his disappointment and frustration at the late  declarations. The Minister reiterated that, to facilitate sound financial  management within Departments, the Executive allow Departments to move  resources across spending areas if that movement is reflective of a proactive  management decision that is taken to enable Departments to manage emerging  pressures within their existing baselines. He has brought that position to the  attention of the House on a number of occasions, but it raises a few questions.  If that flexibility exists, should it not have helped to minimise the level of  Departments&rsquo; late declaration of reduced requirements? Did any Departments that  were eligible to avail themselves of that flexibility not do so? If not, why  not? How much will be surrendered to the end-year flexibility stocks?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: We will not know how much has been surrendered until  the end of the financial year. I emphasised in my statement that Departments  must ensure that they manage their spending in a way that avoids a great deal  of money being handed back and put into the end-year flexibility pot. It is up  to Ministers to consider their spending. We are close to the end of the year,  and I hope that Departments bore all that in mind when assessing their reduced  requirements, bids and so on. I hope that, if Departments envisaged any gaps in  their spending until the end of the year, they declared reduced requirements.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member asked why such flexibility would not have  enabled the avoidance of late declarations. He knows that there can be  flexibility only when proactive management is used to address a problem and  Ministers have looked ahead and acknowledged that there will be an underspend  in one area but an overspend in another. There are limits to where such  movements can take place: for example, one cannot move resources from capital  to current expenditure.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is not just a case of identifying a reduced requirement;  one must also justify moving the money. That must be done for the better  management of Departments, and Ministers must show that they have anticipated a  problem. If the Member looks at the list of allocations that have been made, he  will find that we have allowed a bit of flexibility, which is detailed on, I  think, table 3. When Ministers have come forward with justifiable arguments,  some movement has been allowed. However, this is not just an excuse for moving  money around the Department. It is not enough for a Minister to find, at the  last minute, that there is a bit of money to spare and ask to move it. The  Minister must show that he or she has thought ahead and is managing problems. A  Minister who wishes to build in flexibility to his or her budget by planning  ahead will find that the Department of Finance and Personnel is happy to allow  for those reallocations.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I am drawn to the part of the statement on Civil Service back pay. It mentions  something called &ldquo;near cash DEL cover&rdquo; of &pound;29<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; ">&middot;</span>7  million. I am not sure what is meant by &ldquo;near cash&rdquo;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister of Finance and Personnel appears to believe  that all science is bunkum. Will he join his colleague, Mr Jim Wells,  Chairperson of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety, in  commending the Minister of Health on the way that he has tackled swine flu? It  is better to be prepared than to lose lives. Does the Minister of Finance and  Personnel agree?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">What of the &pound;26<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; ">&middot;</span>5  million of Barnett conse&shy;quentials? That sum will largely come from the  Department of Health and the Department of Education, two Departments that are  underfunded in comparison with the rest of the United Kingdom. Is that not a  reduction in expenditure that could properly have gone to those Departments?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, if the Minister is dealing with the departmental  expenditure limits for this year, how will that be reflected in the 2010-11  spending plans? The statement says that that has been factored in, but,  presumably, it has not yet been finalised.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Minister can choose which question he wishes to answer.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Members are allowed one question, but the Member  always takes the liberty of asking several, and I am happy to answer them all.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member did not listen to my statement; I hope he  listens more attentively to my answers. I have never suggested that all science  is bunkum. From listening to what Mr McCrea has said in the past, I realise  that, perhaps, he does not bring all his critical faculties to bear on such  matters. All that I have said to him and to the House is that, when faced with  scientific information, people should use their critical faculties and  interrogate it. They should ask whether all the assumptions that have been made  are reasonable and whether experience shows that, when siren voices are raised,  their predictions come to pass. There is a list of examples of scientists with  vested interests who have raised issues and made them look like the most  important matters in the world. Millions or billions of pounds were spent on  the millennium bug that was supposed to hit computer systems in 2000, yet  nothing at all happened. I am simply saying that, before people arrive at  conclusions, they should interrogate the evidence. It is clear that the fears  that were raised about swine flu were disproportionate. There has been  speculation in the press as to why some scientists told that story in the way  that they did. I am sure that the Member read some of those stories. All that I  am saying is that it sometimes pays to be critical.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive should take credit for the way in which they  responded to swine flu. When the Health Minister raised the issue, every  Minister in the Executive agreed to their budget being reduced to allow resources  to be made available. That is where I am critical: Ministers were willing to  allow their budget to be reduced, and, as soon as it became apparent that the  money was not needed, Ministers were entitled to expect the money to be  returned, so that they could spend it in the appropriate year. I am saying not  that swine flu was not handled properly but that Ministers, who were willing to  play their part and be team players, expected reciprocation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member does not understand the Barnett consequentials.  They were not the result of money being taken from the Department of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety and the Department of Education. The Barnett  consequentials were sourced from budget decisions that were made for other  parts of the United Kingdom. They were realised from money that was introduced  in England for a boiler scrappage scheme. We decided not to use the money for  that purpose. Most of the money was not a result of reductions for the  Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety and the Department of  Education; it came from a range of areas. The Executive took a collective  decision about how those Barnett consequentials were and are being used. The  decision was agreed by the Member&rsquo;s party leader and the Health Minister. Before  the Member makes criticisms, perhaps he ought to think about how that  collective decision was made.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive will consider allocations of Barnett money  next year in the monitoring rounds. The Member cannot expect me to be  prescriptive at this stage because the Executive will make decisions as the  Budget unfolds.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I am sure that the Minister will agree that the monitoring round will be of  cold comfort to those who are in need of mental health services, care support,  acute or A&amp;E services at Downe Hospital or the many people who require  older people&rsquo;s services. Will the Minister provide details about the &pound;16&middot;2  million for swine flu that was returned to the pot? Is that &pound;16&middot;2 million  underspend due to savings in the GP service and the administration of vaccines?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier today, on a number of occasions, the Minister referred  to the opportunity that Depart&shy;ments had for bids. Is he aware of whether the  trusts had an opportunity to bid for extra funding during the monitoring round?  Will he provide any details of those?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The trusts do not have the opportunity to bid  directly to the Executive; they do that through the Department of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety. I suspect that the &pound;5&middot;5 million capital  allocation was due to the trusts indicating to the Minister that they needed  vehicles, maintenance, IT and so forth. The money was allocated to the Health  Minister on that basis.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member said that mentally handicapped people and others  would take little comfort from the statement. There were no bids from the  Minister in that regard, but he made a bid for funds for elective surgery.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That &pound;16&middot;2 million, or the &pound;13&middot;4 million that he is allowed  to retain for this year, will be used to deal with those pressures and the  demand on those services.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">1.00 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  has explained that the &pound;16&middot;2 million that was returned was not needed because  there was a low level of viral spread, which was associated with lower clinical  hospitalisation and fatality rates and led to lower costs for replenishing  stock levels, activating surge services, delivering communication and media  campaigns, and distributing drugs. Those are the areas in which that &pound;16&middot;2  million was not spent. Given that SAGE indicated in December that the level of  threat was significantly lower, I contend that some underspends could have been  anticipated a bit sooner than the first week in February.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. Given that the Executive are committed  to restarting the construction industry, kick-starting it where possible, does  he share my concern that &pound;5&middot;5 million of capital investment moneys was not bid  for? In my constituency, particularly the Lurgan area, a number of school  estate projects have not got the go-ahead. Will the Minister reassure me that  the money is there for school newbuilds?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to the Minister&rsquo;s comment that Ministers must  better manage their spending, one looks in particular at the Office of the  First Minister and deputy First Minister (OFMDFM) and the Department for  Employment and Learning (DEL), which have made a huge return in the current  monitoring round. Has the Minister discussed with those Ministers how they  might better manage their Departments?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister also advise whether he has had any  discussions about planning reform? We know that sometimes big projects are held  back because of concerns about whether they will get through the planning  system.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: First, in respect of whether the capital moneys  returned could have been used for newbuild, we are near the end of the  financial year in which that money must be spent. With a month left in this  financial year, the money was not going to be spent on a school project. That  is why the money has gone to health and social care trusts to buy vehicles and  medical and IT equipment and to pay for some work on buildings. All of that can  be done fairly quickly and before the end of the financial year.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member has highlighted an important point: the sooner  that reduced requirements are known, the more scope that there is and the  greater the number of projects that there are to which money can be allocated.  The number and kind of projects become very limited as we come closer to the  end of the financial year, which emphasises a point that I made earlier.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Departments, including OFMDFM and DEL, have handed back  money. I do not want to criticise where no criticism is due. If the Member  looks at the table appended to my statement, which shows the money handed back  by each Department, she will see that in some cases Departments might not have  been expected to know any sooner that the money would be given back. For  example, animal health in DARD is demand led, and, therefore, the Department  cannot know whether anything will happen until the end of the year. However,  quite a few of the returns are to do with staffing or with long-planned-for  projects that Departments knew would not be delivered. Those are the kinds of  areas that I will tell Ministers to take earlier account of. For instance,  &pound;100,000 was set aside for an older person&rsquo;s commissioner. It must have been  known at an early stage that that was not going to happen. Why could that money  not have been declared earlier? The message to Ministers is that they should  look and anticipate rather than wait until the last minute.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. I was disappointed that he was unable  to find additional funding for roads maintenance, particularly in light of  their deterioration and the proliferation of potholes due to the recent severe  weather. However, when referring to the Barnett consequentials, the Minister  pointed out that they included funding for a boiler scrappage scheme similar to  the one in England and Wales. He also said that that money had been used to pay  for the equal pay scheme. Does that mean that funding will not be available for  a boiler scrappage scheme here?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Anyone who has driven on the roads, even the main  roads, will have seen the wear and tear caused by the winter conditions, and  they will agree that structural maintenance is greatly needed. However, in the  December monitoring round, an additional &pound;15 million was allocated to the  Department for Regional Development for roads maintenance. How quickly can  money be spent? Having been given the &pound;15 million in December, could the  Department have spent more? There was no bid for the money, as far as I know &mdash;  I hope that I am not wrong in that. There is only a month until the end of the  financial year; could the money have been spent on top of the &pound;15 million that  was given in December? There is a capacity problem in identifying where work  needs to be done and then getting tenders out in time. That must be borne in  mind before making a decision to allocate money. There is no point in  allocating money only to find that it is returned at the end of the year. That  does not benefit anybody.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">No decision has been taken to introduce a boiler scrappage  scheme in Northern Ireland. Of course, using the Barnett consequentials does  not preclude a bid being made through the normal process. However, every year  in Northern Ireland, an enormous amount of money &mdash; for which, I am sure, the  Social Development Minister is very grateful &mdash; is spent on the warm homes  scheme, which, for some people, includes the installation of a new boiler or  even a whole central heating system. It is not that we do not have a mechanism  or, indeed, resources allocated towards better ways to heat people&rsquo;s homes,  help them to reduce their costs and &mdash; an issue that is dear to the Member&rsquo;s  heart, but not so much to mine &mdash; reduce their CO2 emissions.</p>
      <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="3"></a>Executive Committee Business</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading">Housing (Amendment) Bill</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading">Further Consideration Stage</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I call the Minister for Social Development to move the Further  Consideration Stage of the Housing (Amendment) Bill.</p>
      <p class="BillAmend-Moved">Moved. &mdash; [The Minister for Social Development (Ms  Ritchie).]</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:  Members will have a copy of the Marshalled List, which details the order for  consideration. There is one amendment, so there will be a single debate on that  amendment. The amendment replaces the reference to the education and skills  authority with &ldquo;education and library boards&rdquo;.</p>
      <p class="BillAmend-ClauseHeading">Clause 1 (Homelessness)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development (Ms Ritchie)</strong>: I beg to move the following amendment: In  page 2, line 2, leave out sub-paragraph (d) and insert: &ldquo;(d) education and  library boards;&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 1 makes provision for certain bodies to take the  Housing Executive&rsquo;s homelessness strategy into account in the exercise of their  functions. One of the bodies mentioned in clause 1 is the education and skills  authority, which was expected to have been introduced in the Education Bill.  Given that the Housing (Amendment) Bill will complete its passage through the  Assembly before the Education Bill becomes law, it is necessary to make a  technical amendment to ensure that clause 1 only refers to bodies that actually  exist when the Housing (Amendment) Bill receives Royal Assent. Should the  Education Bill progress, I assure Members that the Housing (Amendment) Bill  will be amended to ensure that any body or bodies that replace the education  and library boards will be required to take the homelessness strategy into  account when exercising their functions.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development (Mr Hamilton)</strong>: On behalf of the  Committee, I shall make a few remarks as part of the further consideration of  the Housing (Amendment) Bill. As the Minister said, the Bill includes a list of  Departments and organisations that are required to take the homelessness  strategy into account in the exercise of their functions. Quite properly, the  Bill recognises the important role for education in advising and warning  students of the problem of homelessness. The Bill, as drafted, refers to the  anticipated replacement organisation for the education and library boards.  However, given the delay in the passage of the Education Bill, the Committee  agreed that it is logical and appropriate to amend the Housing (Amendment) Bill  to remove reference to the education and skills authority.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As the Minister outlined, as and when the Education Bill is  passed, it will include an amendment to reinstate the reference to the  education and skills authority in what is expected by then to be the Housing  (Amendment) Act. Given that, the Committee agreed that it supports the  Minister&rsquo;s amendment.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I will elaborate on the  Chairperson&rsquo;s remarks. I missed the debate several weeks ago, and most of the  issues were covered in it, but I want to take this opportunity to thank Peter McCallion and his staff for their excellent  work in keeping us right. I also thank the departmental officials. There was a  lot of discussion, and there was some difference of opinion, but it was  resolved during discussions at Committee Stage.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Simon spoke  about the authorities that will need to take into consideration a homelessness  strategy. The Department was somewhat concerned about including additional  authorities, but we were able to include local government, for example, so it  was worthwhile. I also thank the Minister.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Members &mdash; all two of them &mdash; who contributed  to the debate. I appreciate the very constructive way in which the Social  Development Committee and Members in general have helped to progress the Bill.  I am particularly pleased by the high level of consensus that we have managed  to achieve, and I welcome Members&rsquo; support for the amendment.</p>

      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: As no amendments have been selected, there is no opportunity to  discuss the Budget Bill today, but Members will be able to have a debate at  Final Stage.

      <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="5"></a>Land Registry (Fees) Order (Northern Ireland) 2010</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel &nbsp;(Mr S Wilson)</strong>:  I am going to take up residence here today.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I beg to move</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">That the Land Registry (Fees) Order (Northern Ireland) 2010  be affirmed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Order under section 84 of the Land Registration  (Northern Ireland) Act 1970 seeks to adjust the fees charged by Land Registry,  Registry of Deeds and the Statutory Charges Register, so that the fees cover  the cost of registration activity in line with the requirements of the Act. The  fees set down in the Order will replace those currently in force under the Land  Registry (Fees) Order (Northern Ireland) 2007.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Members will wish to note that the statutory rule is brief  and includes increases and reductions in specific fee levels, all of which, in  accordance with statutory regulations, have been endorsed by the Land Registry  Rules Committee, which is chaired by a High Court judge and includes  representatives from the Bar Council and the Law Society of Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">1.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Order sets out fees for land registration transactions  and includes increases and reductions in specific fee levels. The most  significant point to note is that registration fees, in most instances, are  increased where an application is submitted in paper format only. Reduced fees  equal to or lower than those levied by the Land Registry (Fees) Order (Northern  Ireland) 2007 may be obtained when the applicant chooses to submit the  application electronically. In such applications where the application relates  to a sale of property in the average price range, savings generally equate to  20% less than paper-only submissions. For example, for a property worth  &pound;150,000 the 2007 Order set a fee of &pound;300. Under the current Order, the  proposed fee for such a property is &pound;330 if the application is lodged in paper  format and &pound;270 if lodged in electronic format. For a property worth &pound;200,000,  the 2007 Order set the fee at &pound;450. Under the proposed Order, the fee for such  a property is &pound;495 if the application is lodged in paper format and &pound;405 if  lodged electronically.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The e-registration system, which enables solicitors to make  applications online, contains validation processes. They assist in ensuring  that applications are complete before they are submitted. That improves the  quality of the applications and reduces the processing time in Land Registry.  Solicitors have been, and continue to be, trained by staff of the Land and Property  Services on the e-registration system. The reduced fees for electronic  submissions reflect the reduced cost for the registry of dealing with the  electronic applications and will act as an incentive for solicitors to use that  system. The e-registration system fits well with the continuing progress made  by the Department to increase use of online channels.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Leases now attract fees directly relating to the value of a  property, bringing them into line with the other transactions for valuable  consideration. The fees are based on the actual value of the estate on the date  at which the lease is lodged for registration. Other changes include an  increase from &pound;3 to &pound;3&middot;50 to view a register map, folio or statutory charge  sheet entry; and a &pound;1 fee increase for charges relating to the provision of any  map and documents.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is also a new fee relating to an application that  requires the registrar to rule on the matter. The Registrar of Titles has a  quasi-judicial role, and, over the past three years, there has been a growing  number of hearings requiring consideration and adjudication. Hearings are held  three days each week, and dates are filled until June 2010. I am advised that  hearings can be lengthy and complex; that they require a significant amount of  preparatory work by registry staff; and that the demand for hearings shows no  signs of abating. The registry has not charged for hearings previously, but  with the continuing increase in demand, the cost of hearings cannot continue to  be borne by other fee-bearing applications. That would raise issues around the  cross-subsidising of services.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Although I consider that any fee increase should be avoided  where possible, I am content that the Order strikes a fair balance and is  particularly encouraging in the area of fee reductions for applications lodged  in electronic format.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In line with the convention of giving the legal profession  three months&rsquo; notice of the implementation of new fees, I propose that the  Order comes into effect on 1 June 2010. My Executive colleagues and members of  the Committee for Finance and Personnel were advised of my intention to make  the statutory rule. No comments were received on the proposed introduction. The  Committee was content with the statutory rule. I therefore recommend the Land  Registry (Fees) Order (Northern Ireland) 2010 be affirmed.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel (Ms J McCann)</strong>: Go raibh maith  agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The Committee has been advised that section 84 of  the Land Registration Act 1970 prescribes that fees taken in respect of the  purposes of that Act should, so far as is practicable, cover the operating  costs of Land Registry, which is now part of the Land and Property Services  (LPS).</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">During an evidence session on 20 January 2010 on the review  of the Department of Finance and Personnel&rsquo;s (DFP) spending plans for 2010-11,  departmental officials advised the Committee that LPS was not quite recovering  the full costs of its registration functions. That was said to be mainly  because of the economic downturn. Although steps had been taken to minimise  costs, for example, by reducing staffing levels, officials confirmed that a new  fees Order would be necessary to realise additional income.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The policy proposals that are contained in the statutory  rule, which were considered by the Committee on 20 January 2010, did not  specify the fees that would be chargeable under the Order. In its consideration  of the proposals, however, the Committee noted that the principal changes  applied when an application was submitted solely on paper, and that, as the  Minister explained, a reduction in fees can be obtained when an application is  submitted electronically. It is hoped that that will encourage the legal  profession to submit applications electronically and will, ultimately, lead to  the development of full electronic registration.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee formally considered the statutory rule at its  meeting on 17 February 2010, together with the accompanying report from the  Examiner of Statutory Rules. The Committee agreed to recommend that the Land  Registry (Fees) Order 2010 be affirmed by the Assembly. Therefore, I support  the motion.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I am pleased with the consensus of support across  the Assembly for the regulations. Or, perhaps the lack of contributions signals  the indifference of the Assembly. I thank the Committee for Finance and  Personnel and its Chairperson, Jennifer McCann, for the positive manner in  which they dealt with the statutory rule.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson said that she hoped that the 10% fee  reduction for applications that are submitted electronically would encourage  people to use that mechanism. As well as the cost reduction, it results in  significant benefits, such as the reduced time that is taken in dealing with  registrations. Furthermore, it reduces the possibility of delays due to  mistakes in completing paper applications. I am a technophobe on such matters  but, apparently, when completing the forms electronically, it is impossible to  proceed to the next stage if any information is missing. That has resulted in  only a 2% rejection rate for electronically submitted applications, as opposed  to a 25% rejection rate for paper applications. That could be because people  forget to include a page in the envelope or they forget to sign the form, which  results in rejections, and which, in turn, involves a staff cost.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">One of our aims is to make the operation much more  efficient. The staffing level in the registry section has been reduced by 74  over the past two years. Therefore, the extra 10% that will have to be paid by  those submitting paper applications is not being used to simply finance an arm  of government that is not aiming for efficiency savings. Costs have been  reduced by 34% and there has been a reduction of 74 members of staff. The electronic  version helps to achieve efficiency savings.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Assembly for its support and I thank the  Committee for the work that it did on the issue. I commend the motion to the  House.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">That the Land Registry (Fees) Order (Northern Ireland) 2010  be affirmed.</p>

      <p class="H4StageHeading">Bill of Rights</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30  minutes for the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes in  which to propose and 10 minutes in which to make a winding-up speech. One  amendment has been selected and published on the Marshalled List. The proposer  of the amendment will have 10 minutes in which to propose and five minutes in  which to make a winding-up speech. All other Members who are called to speak  will have five minutes.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly expresses concern that the British  Government&rsquo;s proposals for a bill of rights ignores the advice from both the  Bill of Rights Forum and the Human Rights Commission that social and economic  protections must be central to any bill of rights; and further calls for the  introduction of a robust, enforceable bill of rights that will provide  rights-based protection for all our people.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">&Eacute;ir&iacute;m chun taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt don r&uacute;n.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion. Sinn F&eacute;in worked hard to secure a  commitment to a bill of rights for the Six Counties in the 1998 Good Friday  Agreement. It believed then, and it believes now, that as a remedy and as a  preventative, a strong, inclusive and effective bill of rights is essential to  secure a just and lasting peace based on equality, respect and protection for  all.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">For more than a decade since that provision was won,  getting the right bill of rights has been the priority. Therefore, Sinn F&eacute;in  has engaged robustly and in good faith with the British and Irish Governments  and other parties, including the Human Rights Commission, the Bill of Rights  Forum, a broad spectrum of civic society groups and international and other  legal experts, with a view to reaching an agreement on the form, scope and  content of a bill. Sinn F&eacute;in has also sought and received support for a bill of  rights from friends of the Irish peace process in America, South Africa and  elsewhere.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, the depth of Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s disappointment with the  proposals contained in the NIO consultation on a bill of rights, published more  than a decade later, cannot be overstated. It is with great regret that Sinn  F&eacute;in must totally reject that document as it is not an acceptable way forward.  Not only has the British Government disregarded the carefully considered  position of Sinn F&eacute;in as expressed in numerous submissions before and since  1998 and as set out in the greatest detail in the final report of the Bill of  Rights Forum, they have also disregarded the clear majority view of the members  of that forum and the international and other legal experts who advised and  guided that process. They have also disregarded the carefully considered advice  that the Human Rights Commission provided as required under the Good Friday  Agreement; they have disregarded the consensus view expressed by the Human  Rights Consortium, which represents 140 civic society groups across the North;  and they have ignored the widespread cross-community support for a strong and  broad bill of rights reflected repeatedly in polls and surveys.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">However, Sinn F&eacute;in does not reject the NIO consultation  document lightly. In taking its decision, the party emphasised the grave  charges by the Human Rights Commission that the document does not represent a  genuine effort; that it demonstrates a lack of understanding of the purpose and  function of a bill of rights; that it fails to take appropriate account of  international human rights standards; that it appears to suggest lowering  existing human rights standards; and, finally, that it misrepresents the  commission&rsquo;s advice on the matter. Sinn F&eacute;in shares that analysis and agrees  with that criticism.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in also endorses the view of the leading human  rights academic and former adviser to the Office of the First Minister and  deputy First Minister (OFMDFM), Professor Chris McCrudden, who warned that the  NIO proposal for a bill of rights could do more harm than good. In describing  the proposal as:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;positively dangerous in some of its implications&rdquo;,</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Professor McCrudden warned that such an approach  would lead to a significant blunting of existing equality law in the North.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A useful rule of thumb in assessing proposed changes to  public policy is that new proposals should, at the very least, do no harm. Only  then should we assess whether they are likely to improve things. The NIO  proposals fail both tests. They seek to redraft the existing equality  provisions and, therefore, should be binned immediately.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in will not, under any circumstances, tolerate any  move that undermines the existing provisions on the promotion of the bill of  rights. Hence, the motion calls for:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the introduction of a robust, enforceable bill of  rights that will provide rights-based protection for all our people.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Therefore, we cannot accept the amendment to the  motion.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The equality duty placed on public authorities was an  integral part of the Good Friday Agreement and should not be undermined. The  section 75 duty on the public sector should not be weakened under any proposed  bill of rights. Sinn F&eacute;in is clear that any such attempt or proposal will be  regarded as a fundamental change to the Good Friday Agreement and will be  rejected as such.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">1.30 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That process must not be misused by anyone &mdash; I remind  Members of Mr Durkan&rsquo;s reference to the need to remove the &ldquo;ugly scaffolding&rdquo; &mdash;  to undermine the hard-won rights that we have. Sinn F&eacute;in will not allow the  Good Friday Agreement to be renegotiated downwards through a bill of rights.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. There is too much noise coming from some Benches, and I  cannot hear what the Member is saying. The Member may continue.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Thank you. The promises and responsibilities for the bill of rights should  build on existing protections rather than undermine them. There is an onus on  the British Government to take seriously the response of the broadest coalition  of civic society groups, which has assessed its proposals as &ldquo;pitifully  limited,&rdquo; &ldquo;unacceptable&rdquo; and &ldquo;disrespectful&rdquo;, without &ldquo;any meaningful depth or  scope&rdquo; and, therefore, &ldquo;unworthy of consideration&rdquo;. Sinn F&eacute;in agrees with all  those points.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in cannot and will not accept any proposed bill of  rights that totally excludes economic and social rights protection; hence the  need for the last sentence of the motion. Structural socio-economic  discriminations and inequalities were contributing factors to the conflict  here, not least in employment and housing, and there remain problems today with  the social housing that is required by Catholics in north Belfast.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The routine violation of civic, political, economic and  social rights, gerrymandering, the right to housing and jobs, internment, and  the long-term suspension of many rights under emergency provisions were all  major factors in exacerbating and prolonging the conflict. The British  Government oversaw that regime and they have systematically failed to tackle  the structural inequalities at the heart of the Six Counties ever since.  Indeed, that sentiment is still evident in the institutional resistance to the  equality and human rights element of the Good Friday Agreement during the last  decade. It is precisely that past that should compel those of us who are intent  on building a better future based on equality and rights to continue our  demands for legally enforceable economic and social rights that go beyond the  current inadequate protections to be enshrined in any new bill of rights. I ask  the Members who tabled the amendment to reflect on that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The inclusion of those rights in a bill of rights is totally  legitimate, is provided for under the Good Friday Agreement, is entirely  feasible &mdash; as shown by examples in other democratic jurisdictions &mdash; and, in the  final analysis, is not optional. Current protections are definitely not  adequate to redress conflict legal human rights issues, much less underwrite a  better, shared and equal future. Therefore, a fundamentally different document  to the one that has been provided by the NIO is now needed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Based on the understanding that the Human Rights  Commission&rsquo;s advice represents the floor and not the ceiling of what is  required in an acceptable bill of rights, a new document must and can be  produced in a very short time. By doing so, it will meet the test established  to achieve the six &ldquo;gains&rdquo; identified by the Human Rights Consortium. It must  also address and redress all the human rights legal issues that result from the  civil, political, economic, social and cultural circumstances of the conflict.  It cannot result in lesser rights than those already provided for by domestic  legislation, the Good Friday Agreement, the European Convention on Human  Rights, or any other international human rights treaty to which the British and  Irish Governments are a party. If it is to be of any value, it must provide at  least equal and, preferably, greater rights guarantees.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill of Rights Forum did not fail in its mandate,  despite a long delay in producing its advice, and the Human Rights Commission  did not fail in or exceed its mandate. However, it appears that the British  Government have failed to listen with respect and to genuinely engage and  consult the people of the Six Counties and the available expertise on the  matter.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A lowest common denominator approach is simply not  acceptable 12 years on from the Good Friday Agreement. There can be no veto on  the fundamental rights of any section of the people of the Six Counties ever  again. Those days are gone. I ask Members to support the motion.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I beg to move the following amendment: Insert after the fourth &ldquo;rights&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;; calls on the British Government to expand the current  consultation on a bill of rights to include consultation on the full range of  recommendations of the Human Rights Commission&rdquo;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The amendment attempts to expand the area in which the  British Government are purportedly consulting the people on a bill of rights.  It highlights the inadequacy of the consultation document, which has gutted the  advice that not only the Human Rights Commission but the Bill of Rights Forum  gave. That forum met for almost a year, concluding its deliberations in March  2008, and expressed wide-ranging support for an extensive bill of rights for  Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">First, I will make a number of fairly fundamental points.  The consultation document that the British Government issued is inadequate,  because it minimises the bill of rights. It is also inadequate and wrong in so  far as it devalues the bill of rights and reduces its free-standing nature. The  development of a bill of rights was a commitment that the British and Irish  Governments and the parties to the Good Friday Agreement gave in April 1998 &mdash;  it is not part of a process that the British Government initiated throughout  the UK. It preceded anything on which the British Government embarked to deal  with rights and responsibilities in the UK. It is a free-standing issue. As  such, it must be separated from any process that is taking place in the UK.  Although the process in the UK may be beneficial for the people of the UK, and  for the people of Britain in particular, in my view and that of the SDLP, it is  a wrong-headed approach, because the British and Irish Governments gave a  free-standing commitment, and the bill of rights must be pursued on the basis  of that commitment.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The bill of rights that the British Government envisage  emanating from their consultation and from their consideration of the Human  Rights Commission&rsquo;s advice is quite inadequate. It is restrictive and does not  include social and economic rights, which we believe to be part and parcel of  contemporary legal rights throughout the world. The Bill of Rights Forum or the  Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission has not invented those rights; rather,  they are part and parcel of an international, universalist approach to rights,  which is the building of rights not just on the basis of civil and political  rights but on the basis of economic and social rights. That phenomenon  developed organically from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the  European Convention on Human Rights, and it is of great value to all of us here.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The British Government emphasise at many points throughout  their document that the bill of rights should be predicated on the &ldquo;particular  circumstances of Northern Ireland&rdquo;. Of course, that is what is stated in the  Good Friday Agreement, but the Good Friday Agreement does not state that the  bill of rights should be based on the particular circumstances of &ldquo;Northern  Ireland alone&rdquo;. That particular phrase is so elastic that it does not confine  rights to purely political and civil rights. It goes well beyond that, and  Members should bear that in mind.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If one considers the minimalist approach that the British  Government have taken on rights here in Northern Ireland &mdash; an approach that has  really been confined to political and civil rights &mdash; one will see that those  rights are in fact restrictive in themselves. For example, it includes the  right to vote freely and be elected in genuine periodic elections held by  secret ballot and subject to reasonable restrictions. It could include the  general principle that the electoral system should provide that both main  communities be fairly represented. The Human Rights Commission&rsquo;s advice refers  specifically to proportional representation. The British Government&rsquo;s  phraseology does not include a reference to proportional representation. In  fact, it could exclude proportional representation. It is important to bear  that in mind and to see how minimalist and restrictive the British Government&rsquo;s  approach is to that area of rights.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">People here often talk about rights as if they were  abstract concepts that are better left to lawyers, courts or academics. In  fact, the issue is germane to our political problems and to our political  history. The House of Commons (Method of Voting and Redistribution of Seats)  Act (Northern Ireland) 1929 was significant because, under the Act, the  unionist-dominated Parliament of Northern Ireland voted to abolish proportional  representation. It did so to extend its power and to exercise almost total  control over the Northern Ireland Parliament. In the subsequent general  election of 1929, the Ulster Unionist Party gained an additional five seats and  reduced and weakened the representation of independent unionists and the Labour  Party in Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That was the intention, but if proportional representation  had been enshrined in a bill of rights, the Ulster Unionist Party could not  have done that. The whole purpose of a bill of rights is to enshrine and  entrench rights so that the rights that people now enjoy cannot be removed by  the political caprices of Governments, Parliaments or Assemblies.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is reasonable to argue that rights must be entrenched.  In their consultation document, the British Government have lost the spirit of  the approach to a bill of rights, which is to entrench rights to safeguard  against the events of the past. As we know, the Troubles in Northern Ireland  were initiated as a result of extensive and structural discrimination in  employment and housing. One of the biggest issues was housing. We all know what  happened in Caledon, where Austin Currie got involved in a sit-in protest at a  house and highlighted the widespread discrimination in housing.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If Members say that social and economic rights do not count,  we must ask what the civil rights movement was all about. It was a right and  proper reaction against discrimination, and if we are to prevent discrimination  in the future, we should be entrenching economic and social rights. That is the  essence of the Human Rights Commission&rsquo;s advice.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Bring your remarks to a close, please.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  That is the spirit and the vein in which the issue should be approached, and  the British Government&rsquo;s approach is totally wrong in that respect.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">1.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: I  think that there has been both forensic and good analysis of the Northern  Ireland Human Rights Commission&rsquo;s advice. Some of that advice has been found  wanting in some areas because it is beyond the commission&rsquo;s remit and has been  correctly left out, and the areas in which the rights apply to the whole of the  United Kingdom have been put into their correct and proper place.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I listened carefully to the Members who proposed the motion  and the amendment, and I am concerned by what they said. Martina Anderson set  out a list reasons why the Troubles and human rights abuses came about.  However, does she accept that terrorism has been the single greatest denier of  human rights? Her little list seemed to miss out the fact that in west Belfast,  a single mother of 10, who was unarmed, was taken away, brutalised, tortured  and her body disappeared. Those are not convenient issues that can be easily  looked over. I say to the Sinn F&eacute;in Member who proposed the motion that when  she points the finger at other people for denying human rights, she must  remember that three fingers are pointing back at her. Whenever you murder  single defenceless mothers, whenever you take bodies and booby trap them, and  whenever you shoot judges, you are denying people the ultimate human right &mdash;  the right to life.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The British Government&rsquo;s approach has essentially been the  correct one. We cannot have a situation where democracy is diluted and where  the voting system is made subservient to some form of unelected court.  Churchill was essentially correct when he said:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Democracy is the worst form of Government except all  those others&rdquo;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The democratic system must not be diluted or made the  plaything of special interest groups. Is it not the case that when the Northern  Ireland Human Rights Commission&rsquo;s advice, from which Lady Trimble and I  dissented, was examined, it was found wanting? Is it not also the case that  when that advice was weighed against what the commission was asked to do, it  was shown to be deficient? We find ourselves here as the result of that  situation. To be fair, the Bill of Rights Forum, under the distinguished  chairmanship of Chris Sidoti, allowed opposing points of view to be heard in  the debate and included in the final document. Adopting that approach would  have been far better and would have led to a better consensus.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I know the chief commissioner, and I have many friends on  the Human Rights Commission whom I believe to be very sincere people. I will,  therefore, not get involved in any personal attacks. That said, we could create  a metaphor for the commission&rsquo;s advice: a child who reaches for a bottle of  tablets, believing them to be sweets, ingests them and suffers fatal  consequences. The child might have been sincere, but he was sincerely wrong. In  the same way, I have no doubt that advice from the Northern Ireland Human  Rights Commission was sincere, but it was sincerely wrong. We should do better  by looking for a consensus approach.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The critical issue for most people is that most of the  human rights that are in the bill are already judicable and in the system. I do  not think that we should get into a situation where we try to reinvent the  wheel or redraw the Troubles while ignoring the roles that others have played.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Democratic Unionist Party will bow to nobody in its  defence of human rights. We stand in the British tradition of the Magna Carta  and in the British tradition of William of Orange and the Bill of Rights. We  also stand in the British tradition of the mother of Parliaments, which has  enshrined democratic rights and freedoms here. The Member who proposed the  amendment talked about proportional representation, yet his sister party in the  United Kingdom, the Labour Party, will not accept proportional representation  for Westminster. I think that that stance exposes those parties.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I again invite the Member who moved the motion to state  clearly that there can be no amnesty for those who took, brutalised and  tortured a mother of 10 and denied her the human right to life. The Member must  stand over that, accept that those are grave and grotesque human rights abuses  and be conscious of them when lecturing others.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  Following on from Mr Bell&rsquo;s comments, I must say that it sometimes beggars  belief that some people in the Chamber can stand up and talk about human rights  when people in this society, maybe colleagues of theirs, butchered human  beings.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There are a couple of clear indications that the Northern  Ireland Human Rights Commission&rsquo;s recommendations for a bill of rights for  Northern Ireland will not be enacted. In the first instance, there is not a  majority in the House who consider the proposals to be adequate.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">No one should be under any illusion about the importance  that the Ulster Unionist Party places on human rights. Members of my party have  been instrumental in the advancement of rights and equality in Northern  Ireland. We believe in a society where citizens are equal under the law, and we  believe that equality should be underpinned by rights and responsibilities.  However, we also believe in parliamentary democracy and that decisions about  the allocation of scarce resources should be taken by the people, through their  elected representatives. We do not believe that those decisions should be made  through a judicial interpretation of a set of socio-economic rights, because  that is not democracy. Unlike the commission, we accept the concept of a  scarcity of resources and regard its wish list to be totally unachievable.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I was quite interested to hear Mr Maginness, in proposing  his amendment, say that the abolition of proportional representation in 1929  had increased unionist representation. My understanding is that the number of  nationalist seats increased by four after the 1929 election. Does that not  drive a horse and cart through his argument?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  The Nationalist Party won one extra seat, but the aim of the abolition of  proportional representation was to eliminate independent unionists and the  Labour Party in Northern Ireland, and that was successful.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  So, the Member accepts that the abolition of proportional representation  increased nationalist representation, which is what I was trying to say.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is becoming increasingly clear that the national  Government are determined to kill off the proposals for a bill of rights. Their  consultation document points out several times that the commission has exceeded  its brief, which was to identify Northern Ireland-specific rights. The  Government also share our concerns about socio-economic rights, and one section  of their consultation document, &lsquo;A Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland: Next  Steps&rsquo;, is worth highlighting:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The national debate is also the right context in  which to consider both the opportunities and the risks in attempting to  establish legally enforceable economic and social rights &ndash; including the  challenge of establishing with precision what such rights would actually mean  in practice; the considerable danger that the courts could be drawn into  resource allocation decisions for which they do not have any democratic mandate  and which cannot take account of broader public policy considerations &ndash;  including, crucially, affordability; and the need for the democratically  elected and accountable Government and Executive to retain full responsibility  for the prioritisation of expenditure. The Government believes that these  issues are common across the UK and should therefore best be addressed at  national level rather than solely in relation to Northern Ireland.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I cannot disagree with any of that, and I doubt that anyone  on this side of the House would either.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Government issued that document in November last year  and set the closing date as the start of March this year. That is a  particularly long time. However, they have extended the deadline to the end of  March, and a cynic might suggest that that was an attempt to kick the proposals  under the carpet, which is where they truly belong.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">People in Northern Ireland need a bill of rights; they need  a charter to protect them from the state and from discrimination by others.  However, they have the European Convention on Human Rights, which has been  protecting people across Europe for 60 years, and they have the UK Human Rights  Act 1998, which enacts the provisions of the convention in the United Kingdom.  The 1998 Belfast Agreement, which we have heard much about, mandated the  commission to identify those rights that are not in the convention but that are  specific to Northern Ireland. However, it dreamed up a set of new rights that  were not in the charter but were not specific to Northern Ireland either.  Therefore, the commission has wasted a lot of time and resources in pursuing  what appears to many people to be primarily a political agenda. We have wasted  an opportunity to examine in detail rights issues that are unique to Northern  Ireland and to our past. Instead, the commission has created political  division. It has failed to respect its Belfast Agreement mandate and to examine  Northern Ireland&rsquo;s specific rights adequately. My party accepts the thrust of  the Government consultation but not the motion or the amendment.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  declare an interest as a survivor of the Bill of Rights Forum.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My party recognises that the creation of a bill of rights  is a central aspect of the Good Friday Agreement. Moreover, people in this  society have been striving for a bill of rights for many years. Although we  continue to support the creation of a bill of rights for Northern Ireland, we  have had, and continue to have, concerns about the process that has been  adopted and the proposed content of the various bills that have been submitted.  We have particular concerns about the liberal aspects, the aspects that seek to  entrench sectarian divisions rather than overcome them, the aspects that deny  the wide range of choices of identity and diversity in this society, and the  efforts to, in effect, block the establishment of a shared future.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We would be in a much better place today had things been  done differently over the past decade. Both unionist parties took far too long  to engage with the process. However, when they decided to engage, the two  nationalist parties and elements of civil society continued to pursue a one-sided,  blinkered agenda. No attempts were made to compromise and to agree on a shared  basis on which to move forward. There is now no time left in this session of  Parliament, and it is uncertain how the incoming Government will approach the  issue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise the difficult situation whereby the Northern  Ireland Office has issued a consultation document that even I recognise takes a  very minimalist approach, and it will not be sufficient to address this aspect  of the process. However, equally, the Human Rights Commission, the Bill of  Rights Forum and civil society have made totally unrealistic demands that will  never be acceptable. Although we understand many people&rsquo;s frustrations, it is  important to recognise where we are and how we got here. The Northern Ireland  Office, through its consultation document, missed the opportunity to allow the  public to comment on a much wider range of options. The consultation document  is too narrow and, in that sense, the SDLP amendment makes some sense. However,  I am unsure why it rules out the last clause in the Sinn F&eacute;in motion, which  seems to be at the heart of what the SDLP is seeking.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My party can support the principle of social and economic  rights, which are at the heart of today&rsquo;s debate. Indeed, I recognise that the European  Convention on Human Rights and the resulting Human Rights Act are deficient in  that respect. However, there is a distinction between social and economic  rights that are based around access and treatment and trying to legislate for a  particular outcome through rights. Some matters should be left to democratic  legislators.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">(Mr Speaker in the Chair)</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It must also be borne in mind that some aspects cannot be  addressed on a discrete Northern Ireland basis. For example, although social  security is technically a devolved matter, there is no point putting in place  special rights for Northern Ireland in that area given that a common UK-wide  regime exists. If we become out of step with the rest of the UK, we may face  severe financial consequences. What is happening in the rest of the UK and on  the island of Ireland must also be taken into account. Although a separate bill  of rights for Northern Ireland is still possible, the content needs to be  discussed. Indeed, specific Northern Ireland aspects could be included in a  wider UK bill.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That said, those who seek the deployment of social and  economic rights in Northern Ireland on a special basis still have a major  intellectual and political argument to win. I fully appreciate the particular  context in which our social and economic problems have arisen, but there are  similar outcomes elsewhere on these islands. In certain places, the situation  may be even more severe than it is in Northern Ireland. Any British Government  will find it difficult to argue why special measures should be in place in  Northern Ireland if the same measures are not in place in the rest of the UK,  particularly if those measures have financial consequences. Fundamentally,  whatever happens, there should be no regression from the Human Rights Act 1998.  That comment applies particularly to any incoming Conservative Government.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>:  We are all aware that, when the Bill of Rights Forum completed its work in  2008, the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission gave its recommendations to  the Government on a proposed bill of rights for Northern Ireland. First, it has  to be said that it is fundamental to democracy that people have the opportunity  to vote on human rights issues and that decisions not be left to unelected  judges. However, the intention was that those rights should:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;reflect the particular circumstances of Northern  Ireland&rdquo;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Some of the Bill of Rights Forum&rsquo;s proposals, such  as those on equality, representation and participation in public life clearly  relate to Northern Ireland, as do those on identity, culture and language,  sectarianism and segregation, victims and the legacy of the conflict, and  criminal justice. However, my party made it clear during the Bill of Rights  Forum&rsquo;s deliberations that its recommendations were too wide and were outside  the remit of the Belfast Agreement and the Northern Ireland Act 1998.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Many countries have a bill of rights built into their  constitution. Although the United Kingdom does not have a written constitution,  it is a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights, which was agreed  in 1950. The convention is a binding international agreement, and the rights  contained in it are fully enshrined in UK law. It is also important to note  that the UK is a signatory to a number of human rights conventions, such as the  International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial  Discrimination; the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural  Rights; the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading  Treatment or Punishment; and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with  Disabilities.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Human Rights Act 1998 already enshrines in domestic law  the protections of the European Convention on Human Rights. In addition,  existing legislation provides rights in a range of areas. Freedom of  information legislation, for example, provides a statutory right of access to  recorded information that many public authorities hold. The wider debate in the  UK highlights the fact that rights do not have to be confined to a bill of  rights. The Prime Minister has announced proposals that include the  establishment of new, enforceable rights for hospital patients and improved  entitlements to education for young children.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said earlier, the Human Rights Commission has proposed  rights in a wide range of areas. Many of those rights are the subject of active  consideration in the debate on a national bill of rights. In fact, more than  half of the rights that have been proposed in the Northern Ireland Human Rights  Commission&rsquo;s advice to the Government are equally relevant to the people of  England, Scotland and Wales. Those include the right to marriage or civil  partnership, to education, to freedom of movement, to civil and administrative  to justice, to health, to work and to an adequate standard of living, as well  as environmental rights and social security rights. In that context, my party  believes that it is difficult to justify a separate bill of rights for Northern  Ireland. Ensuring health and employment rights, as well as other economic and  social rights, is hugely important to everyone in the United Kingdom and should  be addressed in the national debate on a bill of rights.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The intention of having a bill of rights for Northern  Ireland would be to reflect our particular circumstances. I believe that much  of the advice given to the Government does not exclusively relate to Northern  Ireland. Therefore, this side of the House cannot support the motion or the  amendment.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I support the motion tabled by my  party colleagues, and I commend them for securing the debate. After  consultation and further consultation, negotiations and further, extended  consultation, we have decided to accept the SDLP amendment. Stephen Farry made  the point that he believed that the last line of the motion was the most  important line for us as a party. The amendment does not remove the last line  of the motion; it just extends and expands on it. I wanted to clarify that  without sending it out to further consultation in the course of the debate.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in supports the introduction of a robust and  enforceable bill of rights that will provide rights-based protection for all  people in the North. We talk about consultation and about what our Executive  Ministers are doing, but it is also important to recognise that the British  Government are consulting on a proposed bill of rights and that that should be  welcomed. However, we also need to highlight the fact that they seem to be  ignoring advice from the Bill of Rights Forum and the Human Rights Commission  on the social and economic aspects and on the protections in a bill of rights.  Jonathan Bell made a good comment: he said that most of the rights are already  here in the system. I want to focus on some of the social justice issues and  leave the bigger politics to one side.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The bill of rights has significance for children and young  people. We need it not only to secure a future free from discrimination for our  children and young people; the rights of everyone in our community need to be  respected. We talk about the age and vulnerability of some of our young people  on a weekly basis in this Assembly. We talk about abuse, discrimination and how  we as a society need to be proactive. We have talked about 52,000 young people  who are not in education, employment or training; that is the kind of social  justice issue that the bill of rights would impact on.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A small percentage of children and young people are  involved in crime and criminality. Some children and young people are in the care  system, through no fault of their own. We should be able to change that and  give everybody a future or a chance to have a secure future. That is what a  bill of rights should do. There is also the issue of provision and resources  for children and young people. Disappointingly, we heard in the statement from  the Minister of Finance and Personnel this morning that money had been handed  back.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We spend 30% less on family and childcare services here  than is spent in England and Wales. We only spend around &pound;80 a head on Sure  Start. Jim Shannon has mentioned Sure Start numerous times. We are talking  about giving children and young people a better start in life, yet, at the age  children are at when they benefit from Sure Start, we spend &pound;80 each on them,  whereas in England they spend &pound;600. The issue of the bill of rights and social  justice needs to be looked at. We need to leave the bigger politics behind. We  should not throw the baby out with the bathwater.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Following extensive consultation, the Human Rights Commission  opted for a strong rights-based approach on the issue of the bill of rights. It  is about individual rights, family rights, community rights and society&rsquo;s  rights. Although we will accept the SDLP&rsquo;s amendment, I plead with other  Members: let us try and deal with this as a social justice matter. Let us not  try and get caught up with the politics of it. We are talking about social and  economic rights and issues. We are talking about creating better communities  and a better society for individuals and families.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Like Stephen Farry, I declare an interest as a survivor of the Bill of Rights  Forum. Indeed, to use common parlance, I am not sure which term &mdash; victim or  survivor &mdash; is more appropriate. Nevertheless, I come at the issue having had a  year&rsquo;s experience on the Bill of Rights Forum.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP does not have a brief for a particular set of  proposals. The NIO consultation is closer to our way of thinking than either  the Bill of Rights Forum or the Human Rights Commission, but we do not have any  emotional attachment to one particular set of proposals.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The proposer of the motion mentioned the need to learn  lessons, albeit from a very different angle. Our criticism of the Bill of  Rights Forum in particular but also the Human Rights Commission is that they did  not learn lessons. Although the Bill of Rights Forum acted with more latitude,  both groups pressed ahead with a report that clearly did not have political  buy-in across the board. There was no buy-in from the Ulster Unionist Party,  the Democratic Unionist Party or, even, the Alliance Party on some issues.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Our society has learned painful lessons about vetoes down  through history. A majority that is opposed by the other community cannot  simply impose its will on that minority. The lesson that a majority cannot  impose its will on a minority and that we need both communities to buy in is  equally relevant to a bill of rights process. We need something that has both  unionist and nationalist buy-in. If it is wrong for a unionist majority to  impose something on a nationalist minority, it is even more wrong for a  nationalist minority to impose its will on a unionist majority.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Both the Bill of Rights Forum and the Human Rights  Commission produced expansive proposals. The Bill of Rights Forum rode out a  whole stable of hobby horses on the matter, and, to some extent, the Human  Rights Commission did the same. The wish lists of everyone in our society with  a vested interest were included. Although the Human Rights Commission shied  away from some of the more controversial ideas of the Bill of Rights Forum, it  largely repeated the same mistake.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There are three things that need to be taken into account.  My party has no buy-in to the Belfast Agreement; we are not supporters of or  signatories to it. However, I agree with Tom Elliott of the Ulster Unionist  Party that the remit &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  You negotiated it.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Yes, and then I washed my hands of it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is clear even to those who take a doctrinaire approach  and support the Belfast Agreement that the proposals put forward by both the  Bill of Rights Forum and the Human Rights Commission drive a coach and horses  through the remit that was laid out in the Belfast Agreement. That remit was to  identify a scope for a bill of rights, but both groups identified a full bill  of rights.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We must realise that we are not in a vacuum. The European  Convention on Human Rights has been signed up to and incorporated into UK law  through the Human Rights Act 1998. Indeed, Northern Ireland, in particular, has  a plethora of legislation that allows checks and balances. Mr Alban Maginness  dragged us back to the 1920s and referred to the iniquities of the House of  Commons (Method of Voting and Redistribution of Seats) Act (Northern Ireland)  1929. I prefer to focus on this century and do not want to dwell on the 1920s.  Anyway, under the current rules of the Assembly&rsquo;s operation, such legislation  could never come about. He is dragging up ghosts from the past, but there are  protections in place.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There has been mention of the particular circumstances of  Northern Ireland. To me, that means something that is peculiar to Donaghadee  and does not apply to Darlington, Dundee or Dublin. Similarly, social justice,  social housing and children&rsquo;s rights have been mentioned. However, there is a  need for social housing in Colchester, Coats Bridge and Cork as well as north  Belfast. These things are not unique to Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The principal problem is that the proposals interfere with  political decisions. Mention is also made of social housing.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Will the Member please draw his remarks to a close?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: A  balance of resources will always have to be maintained. The proposals are wrong  because they take power away from democratically elected politicians and give  it to unelected judges.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate. Unfortunately,  other duties meant that I was unable to hear Members&rsquo; speeches or the tone of  what is an important debate.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Under the Belfast Agreement, the remit of the Northern  Ireland Human Rights Commission (NIHRC) is to advise the Secretary of State on:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the scope for defining, in Westminster legislation,  rights supplementary to those in the European Convention on Human Rights, to  reflect the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland&rdquo;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It must also take account of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s  Human Rights Act 1998. The Ulster Unionist Party has long held the view that  the Belfast Agreement did not ask the NIHRC to draft a comprehensive bill of  rights. Monica McWilliams and the commissioners, with the honourable exception  of Mrs Daphne Trimble and Jonathan Bell, who is now a Member of the House, got  it completely wrong and far exceeded their remit.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The consultation document produced by the Northern Ireland  Office, to which the advertising campaign refers, is a stunning rejection of  the proposals made by a majority of the members of the Northern Ireland Human  Rights Commission. Not a single Government in western Europe would have  accepted such flawed proposals for a region of their country. The entire  process has been divisive and a waste of time and resources.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is inconceivable that any part of any state should have  a comprehensively different set of human rights to another. If that were the  case, the fundamental constitutional integrity of the state would be  significantly undermined, and people in different regions would have a markedly  different set of rights under the law from citizens elsewhere in that state.  That would be an intolerable position, and it would lead to major difficulties  and problems in law.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If a maximalist interpretation were to extend a bill of  rights to cover areas of social and economic policy, not only would that be a  major derogation of the rights of the Assembly and the sovereignty of  Parliament, it would create a new super-legislative authority above and beyond  the Assembly and Parliament. That new authority, based on a bill of rights that  delves deep into social and economic policy, would be anchored in and  interpreted by the courts, which would thereby obtain a power over and above  that of the Assembly and Parliament. Fundamentally, however, the Assembly and  Parliament are charged with making our legislation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A situation in which a court can potentially override the  power of both an Assembly and Parliament has not existed in this country since  at least the seventeenth century. Not only would that be a step back in time,  it would be a step back from democracy. Any weakening of the competence and  authority of democratically elected legislators would undermine democracy. That  is not only a dangerous road; it is one that constitutional and historical  experience teaches us to avoid.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is nonsense to say that an Assembly or Parliament should  create a bill of rights that significantly curtails its powers and authority.  To do so would betray the sacred trust given to us by the people to be their  first line of protection and the democratic agents of change that society  demands. We oppose the motion for all those reasons. This divisive debate needs  to be set aside, and we need get on with reducing poverty and inequality by  boosting our economy and making the correct policy decisions to give children  and families the best chance of achieving.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member should bring his remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  That is where the battle must be fought and won.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I thank the proposer of the motion for bringing it to the Assembly. The NIO  document is a shadow of the recommendations produced by the Human Rights  Commission. For Members who spoke earlier to imply that the commission exceeded  its mandate was totally unjust and unfair. At no time did the commission  receive correspondence from the British Government stating that it had exceeded  its mandate. It is only in recent weeks and months that the British Government,  bowing, I suggest, to unionist pressure, have proposed a hotchpotch of a bill  of rights, The results of a recent survey conducted by the Human Rights  Consortium make nonsense of the notion that only nationalist and republican  parties support a bill of rights. The survey found that over 80% of the  community and many of the Churches support a bill of rights for Northern  Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It was entirely disingenuous of Members who spoke earlier  to suggest that the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland do not warrant  a bill of rights. It is only in the past year or two that a bill of rights has  been looked at by the UK Government. Martina Anderson and Alban Maginness  talked about the discrimination of the past and how that led to the conflict.  For the record and in case anyone suspects otherwise, the SDLP never promoted  violence as a means to tackle unionist discrimination. We always protected the  first basic right of anyone, which is the right to life. That was our cry 40  years ago, and it remains so today. I will not go down that route on this  occasion because this debate is too important to have points made at Sinn  F&eacute;in&rsquo;s expense. In the NIO consultation &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>: <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I am very generous to you. In the &mdash;<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  The document from the British Government suggests that they will consider with  the Executive:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented"><span class="Italic">&ldquo;a general principle of inclusive and equitable representation at a  local government level&rdquo;.</span></p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Where will we get that? Could that deny power  sharing across local councils? The document also states that the Government  will consider with the Executive the requirement that:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the membership of public bodies should, as far as  practicable, be representative of the community in Northern Ireland.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">In addition, the Government propose to:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Consider with the Executive extending the existing  duty on public authorities around promoting good relations, so that public  authorities would also have regard to the need to promote a spirit of  tolerance, dialogue and mutual respect; and to the need to respect the identity  and ethos of the two main communities.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The document also states that the Government will  consider with the Executive:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;whether there are additional language protections  that could be included.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">As we know from the Hillsborough agreement, very  little agreement has been produced by the Executive on those issues. What we  have seen has been a carve-up and the denial of legislation that was promised  in the Good Friday Agreement and the St Andrews Agreement on the Irish  language.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, the Government propose to consider with the  Executive:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;provision to ensure the needs of victims and  survivors of the conflict are addressed.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Executive will not agree a definition of the  word &ldquo;victim&rdquo; never mind how to address the needs of victims in a comprehensive  manner. The bill of rights that Westminster was to have produced is putting  into the hot boiling pot of the Executive the very factors that led to the need  for the Hillsborough agreement and all sorts of working parties. Those matters  should be in a bill of rights.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not see how anyone in this Chamber or in our community  could fear that a bill of rights would not address social and economic rights.  We know that many communities across the North continue to suffer high levels  of social deprivation. In the current recession, that suffering has only  increased, so why would we not consider how to address the needs of people whom  all Members say they represent and care about. Why should that not be  progressively realised? The proposed bill of rights does not say &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Will the Member bring her remarks to a close?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I will finish by saying that the proposals are a progressive realisation of  those rights, which should not put the House in fear of its ability to deliver.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  As Question Time commences at 2.30 pm, I suggest that the House take its ease  until then. When we return to the debate after Question Time, Mr Simon Hamilton will be the next Member to speak.</p>

      <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Executive: Minister of Justice</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">1. <span class="10BoldText">Mr McGlone</span> asked the First  Minister and deputy First Minister for their assessment of the equality  implications of the expansion of the Executive to include the new Justice  Minister. (AQO 835/10<a name="AQO835/10" id="AQO835/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister (Mr M McGuinness)</strong>: Events of recent days demonstrate the  importance of transferring policing and justice powers. I have already stated  my determination that those behind incidents such as last week&rsquo;s mindless bomb  attack in Newry, the murder of Kieran Doherty in Derry and the weekend  disturbances in Craigavon will not undermine the progress that we have made.  Those people, who are anti-peace and anti-justice, are acting against the  democratically expressed wishes of all the people of Ireland, and, apart from  their futile acts, they have nothing to offer society. We will continue on the  road to deliver a better future. Such attacks unite us and serve only to  strengthen our resolve.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In its report of January 2009 on the arrangements for the  devolution of policing and justice matters, the Assembly and Executive Review  Committee recommended that there should be an additional Department to exercise  powers in relation to policing and justice matters. The Committee also  recommended an appointment process for the Minister in charge of that  Department, which would operate until 1 May 2012. The process should be one in  which nominations are invited from Members, and the successful candidate would  require the support of the majority of Members present and voting, including a  majority of designated nationalists and a majority of designated unionists.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">On 20 January 2009, the Assembly approved a motion  endorsing the Assembly and Executive Review Committee&rsquo;s report. The Department  of Justice Bill, which was scrutinised in great detail by the Assembly in the  latter part of last year, gave legislative authority to the single Justice  Department and to the arrangements for appointing the Minister. In our view,  those are sensible arrangements that are appropriate for the initial stage in  the devolution of policing and justice responsibilities, and they are subject  to review by the Assembly before May 2012.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an LeasCh&eacute;ad Aire as ucht a fhreagra. I thank the deputy  First Minister for his answer.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Does the deputy First Minister agree that the way forward,  for a matter with which we have been dealing for a number of years, is to bring  about fairness, inclusivity and equality in all walks of life? Are the deputy  First Minister and the First Minister concerned that the appointment of an  Alliance Party Justice Minister, which he and the DUP support, would create  further political imbalance in the Executive and would result in us having to  face a huge range of equality and inclusivity issues?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. However, I do not think that  the First Minister and I ever outlined a preference between ourselves as to  which party would take up the position of Minister of Justice. That is a matter  for the Assembly on 12 April. As we move forward, it is important to reflect on  the reality that the institutions of which we are a part must be based on  fairness and equality, and I, among many others in the House, subscribe to  that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am heartened by the reaction to the agreement that was  forged at Hillsborough, which has been welcomed by the British Prime Minister,  Gordon Brown; the Taoiseach, Brian Cowen; the Minister for Foreign Affairs and  all the opposition leaders in Leinster House; the Conservative Party and David  Cameron; Barack Obama, the President of the United States; Hillary Clinton, the  US Secretary of State; and the European Union. I just wish that it was welcomed  by the SDLP.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am sure that the deputy First Minister would wish to welcome to the Chamber  as observers Councillor Winston Bennett and his colleagues and officials from  Cavan County Council. That is another welcome.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">On the substantive issue, if the Justice Minister is  appointed without using the d&rsquo;Hondt system, what are the implications for the  operation of the d&rsquo;Hondt system in other cross-community appointments,  including that of the deputy First Minister, and would it point the way to  using a different format for ministerial appointments?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: We have repeatedly outlined our view of all that. We have made it  absolutely crystal clear that we are talking about a temporary arrangement  until 2012. As Ian Paisley said to me in our initial meetings, it is preferable  to have our own Ministers in charge of all the Departments. If I were to go  down the route that has been suggested by some parties in the Assembly by using  d&rsquo;Hondt, I could guarantee that the transfer of policing and justice powers  from London to our Administration would not happen in the lifetime of the  Assembly. That would be totally and absolutely unacceptable.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We are trying to deal with an important issue. The  devolution of policing and justice powers is critical to our society, and the  public would prefer a Minister from here to deal with the issue. In respect of  the implications of what we are doing, we all know that if d&rsquo;Hondt were run  again from the beginning, there would probably be a major reallocation of all  ministerial Departments in the Executive. Would people thank us for doing that  one year before the next Assembly elections? I do not think so.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. Given the fact that all parties support the transfer of  policing and justice powers and that the agreement reached is temporary and  time-limited, does the deputy First Minister expect all parties, despite some  of the current grumblings, to support the arrangement arrived at in  Hillsborough and give effect to the transfer of policing and justice powers?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: I also welcome our friends from County Cavan. Their visit is a  clear signal of how the situation has changed in the Building. Over the past  couple of years, representatives have travelled here from all over the island  of Ireland, and they are always welcome.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Next Tuesday, when the First Minister and I move the motion  on the transfer of policing and justice powers in the Assembly, naturally, I  would like unanimous support. If that were to happen, it would reflect the  overwhelming support of the community and, indeed, throughout the island of  Ireland for the progress that was made at Hillsborough.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We all understand that the agreement at Hillsborough is not  about the transfer of policing and justice powers only. It deals with other  critical matters, such as how we put in place the new improved framework for  dealing with the contentious issues of parades, protests, and so forth. We put  together three working parties, which are dealing with ways to improve the  performance of the Executive; we did that in an inclusive fashion. Therefore,  when the Question on the motion is put next week, there will be a high  expectation among supporters of all parties in the Assembly that they will join  the mood that has been created by the agreement at Hillsborough and move  forward decisively.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The best response to the people who planted the bomb in  Newry, to the people who killed Kieran Doherty and to the people who were  involved in disturbances at the weekend is that we continue to show that we are  united, are moving forward, will not be deflected, diverted, threatened or  intimidated by anybody, but will abide by the will of the people of the North  and of the entire island.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>:  Despite some of the sound bites from the SDLP and the Ulster Unionist Party,  does the deputy First Minister agree that both parties were fully consulted at  all stages, including consultations with the Assembly and Executive Review  Committee?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: I agree with those comments. I pay tribute to Mr Spratt and the  Deputy Chairperson of the Assembly and Executive Review Committee, Raymond  McCartney, for the positive contribution that they, and all the Committee&rsquo;s  members, including those from the Ulster Unionist Party and the SDLP, made to  the work of the Committee. We are dealing with important business; it is about  instilling into our community hope and optimism so that we can move forward,  albeit we come from different political persuasions and backgrounds. It is  important that we do that in a way that delivers substantive change for people  on the ground, makes their lives better, and allows them to reach their full  potential against a backdrop of difficult economic circumstances. The inclusive  way in which the Assembly and Executive Review Committee works and the ongoing  consultations between the First Minister and myself and the Committee for the  Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister shows that that is the  only way to go.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We are determined to continue with that work, but it will  work only if people want to be included. This is about inclusion, and it is  about us being big enough to ensure that everybody is included. That also  imposes a responsibility on others to be included and to make their positive  contribution to what has been an important couple of weeks in respect of  driving forward to ensure the fulfilment of the agreements that we have made.</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Victims&rsquo; Commissioner</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">2.<span class="10BoldText"> Mr Lunn</span> asked the First  Minister and deputy First Minister when a new victims and survivors&rsquo;  commissioner will be appointed. (AQO 836/10<a name="AQO836/10" id="AQO836/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: We received Michael Nesbitt&rsquo;s resignation from the Commission for  Victims and Survivors on 17 February 2010. Members will recall that we framed  the legislation that was introduced to establish the Victims&rsquo; Commission in  such a way as to allow for flexibility in its make-up. We did that because we  knew that there was a significant backlog of work to be addressed and because  we know that the needs of victims and survivors change over time. We will,  therefore, take time to consider how the Commission can best take forward its  work programme.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank Mr Nesbitt for his contribution to the work of the  Victims&rsquo; Commission, and I wish him well in the future.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: I  am not clear as to whether that means that a replacement will be appointed. In  the event that there is, can we expect an open and transparent selection  process that is based on ability and qualifications, or will it be a case of  going through the motions and appointing an Ulster Unionist?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The Member takes a cynical view of how we deal with such  important matters. At the beginning of the process in 2008, four individuals  were identified as having the skills and knowledge base to address the backlog  of work in the victims and survivors&rsquo; sector. We will give careful consideration  to the matter of the number of commissioners, in light of the work required  within their corporate and business plan. We will consider the views of the  existing commissioners, but, at this time, it is too early to come to any  conclusions. The First Minister and I will consider all options, but we will  not be appointing a new commissioner at this time.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  In his response, the deputy First Minister referred to the commissioner, but  the issues for a great many Members are the needs of the victims and survivors.  Can the deputy First Minister assure the House that the Victims&rsquo; Commission  will continue to look after the victims and survivors and ensure that their  concerns and need for help are fully looked after, because we do not want to  see any hold-up in the process?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: On a number of occasions, the First Minister and I have made it  clear that that is a top priority for us. We have a responsibility to ensure  that people who have been victims of the conflict are respectfully dealt with  in a way that allows them to move forward. Life has been difficult for all of  them.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Over the course of the past week, we have seen another  victim: we have seen a young man killed in the city that I come from. We live  in a small world. I knew his grandfather, Vinny Coyle, who was prominent in the  civil rights movement in Derry city, and his grandmother, Vincent Coyle&rsquo;s wife.  I know his grandmother on the other side, Mrs Doherty. I also know his  bride-to-be, God bless her; her heart is aching. She has her wedding dress in  her house, and she had expected to be married in three months&rsquo; time. I have  known her father and mother, Teddy and Betty Miller, for 40 years. I know  Kieran&rsquo;s father, Aidan Coyle. I know all those people, so I know that their hearts  are broken. I know that their hearts have been broken by people who claim to be  acting in the interests of Ireland. Well, God help us, because they do not act  in the interest of Ireland but in their own interests.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As my colleague Martina Anderson said in the House earlier,  those people describe themselves as an army. It is not an army that we are  dealing with but a gang. It is a gang of people who are opposed to peace, who  are opposed to justice and who are opposed to political progress. It is a gang  of people who believe that it is a legitimate political objective to destroy  all the good work that many of us in the House have been engaged in, with the  assistance of others, over the past 15 years. We have had enough victims. The  groups that are out there are mostly on the so-called republican side. Our  message to them is clear: give us a break, go away and get a life, get off  people&rsquo;s backs and recognise that they are going absolutely nowhere. A central  feature of their strategy was to divide the First Minister and me; the DUP and  Sinn F&eacute;in; the Ulster Unionist Party and Sinn F&eacute;in; the SDLP and the DUP; and  to bring the institutions down.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We are approaching the first anniversary of the murders of  two soldiers, the murder of Stephen Carroll and the murder of Kevin McDaid in  Coleraine. The greatest response to those groups now is the response that we  gave at that time. The way in which we stood together sent a powerful message  to the world. We are going to have to do that again in the aftermath of the latest  ridiculous acts, which were carried out by people who represent absolutely no  one in our society.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We say to them: give us a break, we want no more victims,  we want you to go away, stop your activities, give us the opportunity to move  forward, and if you have the intelligence and the ability, you can continue to  oppose politically what we are doing, but the use of violence has had its day  in the North and on the island of Ireland. We are moving forward. We will not  be diverted. Instead of each act that they carry out making us weaker, it will  make us stronger, and stronger than ever before. No matter what they do, we  will continue to move forward together.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. T&aacute; ceist agam don Aire.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the deputy First Minister outline the Executive&rsquo;s  achievements in delivering a strategy for victims and survivors of the  conflict? I ask that question mindful of the failure of the previous Executive  to address the needs of victims and survivors substantively.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: As we all know, the strategy for victims and survivors was  published in December 2009. It is a 10-year strategy that represents our  commitment to the victims and survivors of the conflict and shows how we plan  to provide help and support for victims and survivors over the coming years.  The strategy is built around the Commission for Victims and Survivors, the  forum for victims and survivors and a new victims and survivors&rsquo; service. The  Commission for Victims and Survivors was established in June 2008 to promote  awareness of the interests of victims and survivors. In September 2009, the  commission established the forum for victims and survivors, which will run in  pilot form until June 2010. The forum proper will be established following an  evaluation of the pilot. The forum&rsquo;s aim is to improve government&rsquo;s awareness  of victims and survivors&rsquo; issues. It is representative of victims and survivors  and includes representation from the statutory, voluntary and community  sectors.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Draft proposals on a new victims and survivors&rsquo; service  went out for consultation in August 2009. We are discussing the next steps in  the process in light of the responses to that consultation. The new service  will be the focal point for funding work with victims and survivors and will  provide that funding to the sector on the basis of assessed and agreed need.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We do not underestimate the size of the task involved in  establishing the service. We fully understand the complexities and  sensitivities that are involved. However, we stress that it is our intention to  establish the service as soon as is practicably possible. That will remain our  focus.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">An unprecedented &pound;36 million has been allocated to support  work with victims and survivors during the spending period 2008-2011. That is  more than double the amount that was allocated to the work in the previous  spending round.</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Parades</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">3. <span class="10BoldText">Mrs D Kelly</span> asked the  First Minister and deputy First Minister why two of the authors of the interim  Ashdown review of parading are in attendance at the parades working group; and  whether they can confirm that no decision will be taken regarding disputed  parades without the agreement of residents&rsquo; groups. (AQO 837/10<a name="AQO837/10" id="AQO837/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: As part of the agreement reached at Hillsborough Castle on 5  February 2010, the First Minister and I agreed to set up a co-chaired working  group comprising six members appointed by us who had experience of dealing with  parading issues. The group&rsquo;s remit was to bring forward agreed outcomes and  proposals that it believed to be capable of achieving cross-community support  for the new and improved framework.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">On 8 February 2010, the First Minister and I confirmed that  the members of the working group would be the Rt Hon Jeffrey Donaldson, Nelson  McCausland, Stephen Moutray, Gerry Kelly, Michelle Gildernew and John O&rsquo;Dowd.  The working group appointed two advisers, the Rev Mervyn Gibson and Sean  Murray, who have attended meetings of the working group to offer advice, if  required. The Member will be aware that the working group has been involved in  a period of intense work to progress the task at hand, which included a series  of meetings with elected representatives and a range of stakeholders, including  representatives of the residents&rsquo; groups.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The working group was tasked with making a report to  Ministers, but it is acknowledged that finding a resolution to parading issues  will require the consideration of the views of all stakeholders, including  residents. I am pleased to confirm that the working group presented its report  on the agreed outcomes to the First Minister and me, and work is progressing  further, in line with the timetable set out in the Hillsborough agreement.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As I laid out in the agreement, future work will include  full consultation on a draft parades Bill, with further consultation through  the Assembly Committee in September. We realise that it is essential that any  work on parading maximises public support, and we are committed to extensive  consultation on, and scrutiny of, any Bill.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Does the deputy First Minister have any concerns about the fact that two of the  main authors of the Ashdown review are involved in the parades working group,  given that their deliberations resulted in a recommendation that the Parades  Commission be abolished? Is he not concerned that the working group&rsquo;s report  will not be presented to the Executive or the House? I listened carefully to  what the deputy First Minister said, and he talked only about the draft  legislation going out for consultation. Will the working group&rsquo;s report not see  the light of day? Will it be seen only by Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: There is general agreement in society, and general agreement at a  political level &mdash; apart from the reservations expressed by the SDLP and the  Ulster Unionist Party &mdash; that it is challenging to attempt to put in place a new  agreed framework to try to create circumstances that will see all the  controversy that has existed around contentious parades resolved. That work is  important. It is looking at an agreed way forward with a new and improved  framework. I am open to correction, but I think that I heard one or two members  of the SDLP say in radio interviews over the past couple of weeks that they  agreed that it was important to try to bring about an agreed framework. We are  involved in a noble cause, and we have taken on board the concerns expressed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">However, we all know how government works. The First  Minister and I made it clear from the beginning that when the working party  came forward with its report, we would send it to the legislative draftsmen,  who would put the legislation in place. We made it clear that the draft  legislation would then come back for public consultation over a 12-week period  and would be subject to extensive debate and discussion in the Assembly, in  which all parties would be involved. The public would also be aware of the  situation. Trying to score cheap political points does nothing to address the  major task of ensuring that we move forward in a way that delivers outcomes and  results that will make life better for the people whom we all represent.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Will the deputy First Minister explain why two of his colleagues were in the  village of Dunloy in my constituency yesterday, where there was a commemoration  to two IRA members at which there was a display of paramilitary paraphernalia?  The Dunloy Fallen Comrades Republican Flute band, which had the picture of two  Armalite rifles on the side of its drum, was also present.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member should come to his question</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Those are the very things that we are, rightly, being told are unacceptable in  loyalist parades. Is it not the height of hypocrisy for the two Members who are  sitting behind the Minister to have been present in Dunloy yesterday, where  Orangemen have been denied their right to march for nine years, because of the  intransigence of republicans?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: I was not in Dunloy yesterday, so I do not know &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  do.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The Member may well know, but I do not know what occurred there.  The Member has made his point and people will reflect on that. However, the  important thing is that we have put in place a process that will establish a  new agreed framework for moving forward. The duty and responsibility of every  Member of the House is to contribute to that in a way that lessens tensions in  society.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members will recall a time not so long ago when I was  in the Diamond area of the walled city of Derry and heard that approximately  250 people were sitting in protest on the streets of Dunloy. That was on 12  July, and I do not normally travel anywhere on that date, just in case I meet  people on the road who would not want to meet me. However, on that occasion, I  got into a car on my own and drove straight to Dunloy, through Coleraine, and  spoke to citizens in Dunloy who behaved very responsibly and sensibly and took  my advice. The outcome on that day at least, whatever the outcome on other  occasions, was one that everyone could live with.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As we go forward, we must be positive and constructive and  work with the agreements that we have put in place. Those are agreed processes  between the parties in the House &mdash; at least, the two major parties in the House  &mdash; and it is our duty and responsibility to make them work in a way that  delivers for everyone.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Does the Minister agree that although  some progress has been made on the issue of contentious parades through the  establishment of the Parades Commission, there is further room for improvement,  particularly in securing local agreements and inclusive dialogue, to ensure  that the outstanding parading issues are resolved?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: First of all, I wish the Member a happy birthday. I was given a  figure for her age earlier, but I am afraid to repeat it in case I get a clap  around the ear. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We all know that the Hillsborough agreement outlines our  commitment to a new and improved framework that is fashioned by all  stakeholders and that maximises cross-community support. I do not think that  anyone can object to any of it. It is about local people providing solutions  and respecting the rights of those who parade and those who live in areas  through which others seek to parade. That includes the right for everyone to be  free from sectarian harassment, and it recognises that, at times, there are  competing rights. It is about transparency, openness, fairness and independent  decision-making. We recognise that any improved regulatory framework must be  capable of maximising cross-community support.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We have an agreed way forward. There is work for us to do  to deliver that by December of this year, and, with good heart and spirit from  everyone, we are well up for that task.</p>

      <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Community Planning</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">1. <span class="10BoldText">Dr Farry</span> asked the  Minister of the Environment for an update on the development of a community  planning system. (AQO 850/10<a name="AQO850/10" id="AQO850/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment (Mr Poots)</strong>: Proposals for the legislative framework for  council-led community planning are included in my proposals for the local  government reorganisation Bill, which are before the Executive for clearance.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The strategic leadership board that I chair has endorsed a  community planning foundation programme to be taken forward by the transition committees.  That programme will ensure that the new councils are prepared for the  introduction of the statutory duty in May 2011.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  thank the Minister for that response. In the light of the vote that will be  taken next week in the Assembly on the devolution of policing and justice, will  he give his full consideration to ensuring that, whatever model of community  planning comes forward under that legislation, it will encompass the criminal  justice agencies from day one, so that we can ensure that there will be a  holistic approach to community planning that can address issues such as levels  of offending and reasons for offending in communities?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Community planning needs to be holistic and incorporate  all of the various arms of government, so that the public can have an input and  influence at that level through the community planning exercise. Irrespective  of whether policing and justice is devolved, it is important that the community  has the opportunity to make its views and opinions heard through that process.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I remind Members that, if they want in, they must continually rise in their  place.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>:  Mr Speaker, I apologise for my indiscretion. Will the Minister tell the House  what he sees as the principal issues in a community planning scheme and how  they should relate to other government Departments?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Community planning will provide a framework whereby  councils, government Departments, statutory bodies and other relevant agencies and  sectors can work together to develop and implement a shared vision for  promoting the well-being of an area based on effective engagement with the  community. Effective community planning will improve the connection between  regional, local and neighbourhood issues and priorities through partnership  working and by making best use of all available resources to deliver improved  outcomes for all our citizens.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  Will the Minister confirm that his Department will fund the community planning  system, or does he propose that the costs will be borne by local government?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I want to ensure that we have a more efficient and  cost-effective local government administration. Therefore, if everyone works  with me in ensuring that we deliver that, ratepayers will save money and will  not be asked to pay more.</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Greenhouse Gases: Hydrogen</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">2. <span class="10BoldText">Ms Anderson</span> asked the  Minister of the Environment if he has explored the use of hydrogen as an  alternative to fossil fuels, in light of the Programme for Government  commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25% by 2025. (AQO 851/10<a name="AQO851/10" id="AQO851/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Although energy policy is the responsibility of the  Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, I understand that many  companies are working to develop technologies that might effectively exploit  the potential of hydrogen energy for transport. Although hydrogen that is  prepared without using fossil fuel inputs produces no carbon dioxide emissions  when used as a transport fuel, there are a number of drawbacks. Those include  its low energy content per unit volume; high tankage weights; issues of  handling, storage, transportation and filling of vehicles; the large investment  in infrastructure that would be required to fuel vehicles; and the inefficiency  of production processes. I cannot say whether hydrogen will become a suitable  alternative to fossil fuels in the long run.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee on Climate Change, which provides independent  advice to the Government, suggested in its December 2008 report that electric  cars combined with the decarbonisation of electricity generation could lead to  dramatic reductions in emissions from cars and light vans. However, it is not  only hydrogen- or electric-powered vehicles that can reduce emissions from transport.  When I visited the Lotus factory last month, I saw at first hand the  groundbreaking research project into a new engine concept that is being  developed in partnership with Queen&rsquo;s University and Jaguar. The engine is  designed to maximise the benefit from the use of biofuels in relation to  thermal efficiency, fuel economy and reduced emissions. I believe that we need  to consider all of those initiatives and their potential to reduce transport  emissions, which account for nearly 30% of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s total carbon  dioxide emissions.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat. I thank the Minister for that answer. Is he aware of  the University of Ulster&rsquo;s proposals to create a hydrogen highway across  Ireland, between Belfast, Derry and Donegal, along similar lines to projects in  other European countries? Is he prepared to discuss that with the University of  Ulster and, if there is any merit in it, perhaps to discuss it further with his  Executive colleagues, although it is obviously at an early stage?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I am always happy to discuss such matters, particularly  with research bodies such as universities. They can make realistic proposals  that can deliver a reduction in the amount of carbon that goes into the  atmosphere. All of those proposals must stack up in the real world, and the  question is whether they can be sold to the private sector. I am certainly  happy to work with those organisations, which are investigating other outcomes  that may be positive.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  am certainly interested to hear of the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to supporting  research, but many solutions to reducing carbon output are available already.  In light of the commitment to reduce carbon output by 25% by 2025, what action  is he taking with his colleagues the Minister of Enterprise, the Minister of  Agriculture and the Minister for Regional Development to deal with the massive  use of energy by their Departments?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: My Department works closely with colleagues in the  Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in particular to deliver the  strategic energy framework. There are huge opportunities in Northern Ireland to  identify renewable energy sources, including wind, wave, tidal and energy from  waste. There are numerous opportunities. In conjunction with the Department of  Finance and Personnel, we are seeking to make the government estate carbon  neutral by 2015. The Executive are committed to reducing the amount of carbon  that goes into the atmosphere.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  The Minister highlighted the virtues of the modern electric car and its  potential. What have he and his colleagues done to ensure that Northern Ireland  has an infrastructure that is capable of supporting such a vehicle, which is  already being developed in many cities throughout the United Kingdom?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Electric cars are beneficial only if carbon neutral  electricity is being used in them. There is little point in using an electric  car if the energy that is used in that car has been produced from oil, coal or  gas. They only work well if they are used in conjunction with renewable  energies, so we are working to drive up the amount of renewable energy that we  use. We are also looking at the potential for Belfast to bid to be one of the  six UK cities to plug in electric cars. That would create an opportunity for  Northern Ireland to further develop the electric car industry.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The real benefit of an electric car is that it can be  plugged in at night and, because that energy is being produced at night, it has  a carbon neutral effect. Ultimately, the way forward for transportation in the  United Kingdom will be that many more electric cars will use renewable energy  and will not have the damaging impact on the environment that combustible  engines have.</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Road Safety</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">3. <span class="10BoldText">Mr Bell </span>asked the Minister  of the Environment if any initiatives are being planned or imple&shy;mented to  promote safety on our rural roads. (AQO 852/10<a name="AQO852/10" id="AQO852/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: One of my Department&rsquo;s key responsibilities is to work  towards further reducing the number of people killed or seriously injured on  our roads, and a key part of that is improving road safety on rural roads. If  we are to make a real difference in casualty reduction, we will have to tackle  the rural nature of our road safety problems. Road safety education officers,  who operate across Northern Ireland, and the Department&rsquo;s high-impact  advertising campaigns help us to achieve those aims.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, a new funding model will operate from the  2010-11 financial year, enabling the Department to engage more fully with the  voluntary and community sector and ensure that it, in turn, engages more  effectively with local communities in the promotion of road safety. That will  replace the previous system of direct funding solely to the Road Safety Council  and the road safety committees. It is designed to direct funding to individuals  or groups in rural and urban areas to better address road safety issues at a  local level. It will also enable the Department to expand its geographical  cover for road safety activities and events throughout Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Shortly, I will consult on the development of a new road  safety strategy for Northern Ireland, and I will make a statement to the House  in the next few weeks. The new strategy will be introduced before the end of  2010, two years ahead of the expiry of the existing strategy. My officials have  already engaged with road safety partners and other interested parties in  developing over 170 possible measures to improve safety on our roads. The  measures proposed in the consultation paper, all of which have undergone a  high-level rural impact assessment, will also address the behaviours that  contribute to the numerous deaths and serious injuries on rural roads.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his answer. Will he acknowledge the concerns that exist  in many of the rural parts of my Strangford constituency, as evidenced recently  by a massive turnout at a district policing partnership meeting in Kircubbin  that centred solely on the issue of road safety? Will he outline any progress  that has been made on improving road safety in rural areas?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Towards the end of last year, I challenged the PSNI to put  more resources into rural roads; they subsequently agreed to reduce motorway coverage  by 30% and transfer that to rural roads. That is a positive move, because the  vast majority of road deaths &mdash; between 70% and 80% &mdash; occur on rural roads.  Rural roads need to be targeted more, and people must be made aware that they  are more likely to be caught now than formerly when driving at excessive speeds  or driving dangerously. There needs to be a substantial concentration of police  resources on rural roads. People&rsquo;s attitudes to driving on rural roads and to  the consequences of excessive speed need to change, because that is where the  deaths are taking place.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  Has the Minister had or will he have a meeting with the Minister for Regional  Development to discuss how much has been spent on rural roads to ensure that  they remain as safe as possible?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I know that officials will tell me that drivers, not  roads, are responsible for road deaths. Nonetheless, deaths are much more  prevalent on certain roads; accidents and road deaths are less likely on  motorways and better-quality roads. We cannot, therefore, totally isolate or  separate the two. The Executive have introduced an investment strategy to  upgrade roads on which there have been a significant number of deaths. Roads  such as the Dungannon to Ballygawley Road, the Newry bypass and the A8 between  Larne and Belfast, where many incidents have taken place, are being upgraded,  and I warmly welcome that.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  The Minister said that rural roads contribute to accidents. Does he agree that  there should be discussions with Roads Service about the deteriorating  condition of rural roads, which has been caused by flooding, and the presence  of potholes, sunken manholes and service manhole covers? Has the Minister had  any recent discussions with Conor Murphy to ensure that there is further  investment to address that?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member should come to his question.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Poor road conditions contribute to serious road accidents.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The Member has given a fairly brutal analysis of Roads  Service&rsquo;s performance. He should raise the matter with the Minister for  Regional Development himself.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as na freagra&iacute; sin. I welcome the news that the  Minister is bringing forward a road safety strategy. Does he agree that the  GAA&rsquo;s Live to Play initiative should be rolled out with other sporting  organisations, because they have direct contact with many young drivers and  that that would complement the Minister&rsquo;s work?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Live to Play is a terrific initiative; it is  forward-looking and gets the message across to many young people. I know that  the GAA has lost some of its young players to road accidents, so sporting  organisations and schools can help us to address that. There is a range of  bodies that reach people in areas where big government can never get to. We can  do with all the assistance that we can get. The money that has been set aside  for road safety will enable local organisations to tap into such campaigns now.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Planning Applications</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">4. <span class="10BoldText">Mr McKay</span> asked the  Minister of the Environment if he has ever asked the Planning Service to defer  final approval of a planning application for a sporting facility that had  already been passed by a local council. (AQO 853/10<a name="AQO853/10" id="AQO853/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: If an MLA or an MP asks for a meeting about a planning  application after a council consultation, it is standard practice for the  decision notice to be held to allow that meeting to take place. That has been  normal practice for many years, under direct rule and the devolved  administrations.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am aware of only one application for a sporting facility  on which approval has been deferred at my request, following the local  council&rsquo;s agreement with my Department&rsquo;s opinion. That application was for a  GAA pitch on land adjacent to 69    Burrenbridge Road, Bryansford. The application was  presented to the local council as an approval and was agreed at its meeting on  26 October 2009. The issuing of the decision was held back to allow me to meet  Jim Wells MLA. That meeting has taken place, and the application remains under  consideration.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his answer.  There would be concern if MLAs could hold up planning applications in the way  that that application has been held up. The application was for a GAA facility  in Bryansford, and the Minister ordered senior planning staff not to issue an  approval notice, because of the opinion of Jim Wells.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">By treating the GAA differently from other planning  applicants because of Jim Wells&rsquo;s discriminatory views, has he left his  Department open to legal challenge? Has he set a dangerous precedent, because  he has clearly brought both his office and his Department into disrepute by  allowing the GAA application to be singled out?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I totally refute the suggestion that anybody has brought  anything into disrepute. Mr McKay may wish to know that members of his party  have had applications deferred after councils have consulted on them. So, I am  not offering something to a member of the DUP that has not been offered to  members of any other party. Members of those parties know who I am referring  to, because they have done it; they were entitled to do it, and that has been  the policy for many years.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We were just talking about road safety. The proposal is for  a fairly large facility, which will open onto a C-class road, and the PSNI&rsquo;s  traffic branch has submitted a very critical report and analysis of the road  safety issues with the application. Therefore, the application is not  particularly straightforward, and the issues that Mr Wells raised were planning  ones, not political ones.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  The Minister will be aware of the discussions and the ongoing press speculation  about Knock Golf Club. Will the Minister tell the House whether he is happy  that all aspects of that application have been dealt with appropriately? Have  all political parties on the local council concerned agreed to the application?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: It is interesting that the Member should ask about that. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> That application has been the subject of a lot  of press interest, which was largely motivated by individuals who are out to  get other politicians. Those people are not interested in the welfare of those  who live around Knock, the people who belong to Knock Golf Club, the people who  use the Ulster Hospital, or the Dundonald community.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Interestingly, a meeting took place on Wednesday 5 March  2008. That meeting was attended, on the political side, by Councillor Robin  Newton, Councillor M&aacute;ire Hendron, Councillor Jim Rodgers, who was the Lord  Mayor of Belfast  at the time, and Councillor Mary Muldoon. Paragraph 2 of the Department&rsquo;s  minutes of that meeting states:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Each of the councillors and politicians then spoke in  support of the application. As before, they pointed out that there had been no  local opposition to the proposal other than the Dundonald Greenbelt Association  and that there is widespread political and community support.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I also have a letter from John Simpson of the Ulster Hospital,  which sets out very clearly why his organisation supported the application and  how it would have benefitted. If anybody wishes for that letter to be made  public, I will make it public. In fact, I will ask for a copy of that letter to  be placed in the Library, so that it is on the public record. Nothing wrong has  been done in respect of that application, and for Mr Dallat and others to  attack my Department&rsquo;s officials in the way that they have is morally corrupt.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  In light of the Bryansford situation, has the Minister given any consideration  to the guidelines that councillors and MLAs should follow when making  representations on behalf of applicants or complainants?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: It is very clear: representations on planning issues  should be about planning matters, not about social concerns. In that case, the  planning issues that an individual Member raised with me related to roads; road  safety; access between the Bryansford Road and the Burrenbridge Road; bus usage  of those roads; parking for those vehicles; and the proposed access from the  chapel car park to the GAA grounds. Therefore, a range of definitive and  qualitative issues were raised for further assessment.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>:  Will the Minister outline the legislative power through which he can intervene in  an individual planning application and whether he has ever used it? Does he  agree that it can be confusing for planners if, on one day, the Minister is  discussing an issue with them and, on the next day, is lobbying them as a  councillor?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Regardless of whether I am a councillor, I lobby on behalf  of my constituents as an effective MLA. I make no apology for working on behalf  of my constituents; perhaps other Members want to apologise for not working on  behalf of their constituents. The Member might be aware of the Planning (Northern Ireland)  Order 1991, which gives the power over all planning decisions to the Minister,  who subsequently delegates that power to divisional planning offices.  Therefore, I am responsible for every planning decision in Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Planning Policy Statement (PPS) 21</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">5. <span class="10BoldText">Mr McGlone</span> asked the  Minister of the Environment to outline the current position on PPS 21,  particularly in relation to non-farming rural dwellers. (AQO 854/10<a name="AQO854/10" id="AQO854/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I circulated PPS 21 for Executive clearance in December  2009 and will publish it when I receive that clearance. The planning policy  statement has been finalised and takes account of the outcome of the public  consultation, operational experience, Planning Appeals Commission decisions and  the report of the independent working group on non-farming rural dwellers.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  I thank the Minister; I know of his personal interest in the matter. Does he  agree that the existing PPS 21 provides little opportunity for non-farming  families unless they have a replacement or an infill site? Moreover, does he  agree that much more creativity is required to provide housing in rural areas  and to factor in environmentally sensitive aspects to ensure that the majority  of people &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member should ask his question.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  &mdash; in rural areas have access to housing in their areas.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I hope that Mr McGlone and his colleagues will inform me  if they know an easy solution. We have established an independent working  group, which has reported. It is an important issue, and we need to continue to  work on it. Some helpful issues have been included in the proposals for the  final PPS 21. Nonetheless, some issues are outstanding. Therefore, we will  continue to work to find out whether we can drill down and identify what can be  done. It is important that the Department for Regional Development (DRD) and  the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) are fully engaged in  the process, because DRD is responsible for the regional development strategy  and DARD is responsible for rural affairs. Those two Departments have a key  role to play to deliver on the issue.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  Wearing my other hat, I declare an interest as a member of Ards Borough  Council. Several applications are deferred every month under PPS 21. Indeed,  next Tuesday, several applications will come before the council, 44 of which  are scheduled for refusal, and half of those are under PPS 21. Will the  Minister confirm whether all applications that have been deferred under PPS 21  and that will be deferred in the future, including those at next week&rsquo;s council  meeting, will return to councils before a decision is issued?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The answer is yes. My Department has been considering how  it will respond, because around 2,500 applications have been deferred thus far.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Each divisional planning office has been looking at how it  will deal with those applications. We hope to be able to deal with the vast  majority of applications within six months of PPS 21 being finalised. I hope to  soon put PPS 21 to the House; thereafter, decisions will flow from that, which  will be beneficial.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  The Minister&rsquo;s response is disappointing. As I predicted, PPS 21 has been  totally ineffective. I look at how it has affected north Down. For example,  prior to PPS 14, there was only a very small number of single dwellings in the  countryside, but now we are getting a massive number of planning applications.  PPS 21 has not only affected rural areas, it has affected urban areas such as  north Down. Will the Minister review what is happening in those areas?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: PPS 21 cannot affect an urban area because it is a rural  planning policy. The Member seems to want a policy that differentiates between  certain areas in Northern    Ireland. There will be no differentiation  between any areas of Northern    Ireland. The policy will apply across Northern Ireland, and its benefits will apply to  all the people of Northern    Ireland. Mr Wilson may propose that we  discriminate against the rural dwellers of north Down but I am not going there;  I will not discriminate against the community in north Down.</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Planning Policy Statements</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">6. <span class="10BoldText">Mr Armstrong</span> asked the  Minister of the Environment when he expects the full range of planning policy  statements to be available. (AQO 855/10<a name="AQO855/10" id="AQO855/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Subject to Executive Committee agreement, a  fit-for-purpose suite of planning policy statements (PPS) required to meet the  public service agreement target will be available by the end of March 2011. In  addition, a revised PPS 1 will be completed in tandem with the planning reform  legislation.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that while the full suite of policies is unavailable,  planners are unable to make judgements that take all matters into  consideration? Does he also agree that, in light of the Public Accounts  Committee&rsquo;s recent report, his Department&rsquo;s Planning Service is essentially not  fit for purpose, because it is taking up to 71 months to develop the new  planning policy statements?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Obviously, if a full suite of policies is not available,  other considerations have to be taken into account and those circumstances make  it slightly more difficult for planning officers.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  Is the Minister confident that the new planning policy statements will be  strong and robust? Furthermore, will he assure us that they will not be  conveniently set aside by councils? For example, according to what we have read  in the papers, Castlereagh Borough Council has set aside planning policy  statements.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: If Mr Gallagher has some evidence relating to Castlereagh  Borough Council ignoring planning policies, he should produce it. We cannot  have sweeping statements in the House that are made on the basis of trial by  the press or other media. That is pathetic, and it is completely out of order.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  That ends questions to the Minister of the Environment.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Was it in order during question 4 for a Member  from the DUP Benches, from a sedentary position, to accuse another Member of  being sectarian?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I will come back to the Member. Let me check the Hansard report.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: On  a point of order, Mr Speaker. Is it appropriate for Mr Dallat, from a sedentary  position, to shout at the Minister to resign? One would have thought that the  Deputy Speaker, who has already made a mistake this morning, should have known  better.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  That issue was raised a number of months ago, when I clearly indicated to all  sides of the House that speaking or shouting from a sedentary position is  wrong. Some Members feel that by doing that, their remarks just might not be  picked up by Hansard. I can assure Members that, on occasion, such remarks are  picked up by Hansard. Nevertheless, I warn the entire House that we should not,  as far as possible, get to a position in which Members are trying to speak from  a seated position.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I know that, during Question Time, we follow  the principle of trying to get answers that are as full and as frank as  possible. However, I noted that during questions to the Office of the First  Minister and deputy First Minister today we managed to get through all of three  questions. I bring that to your attention, Mr Speaker, and ask you to look at  it so that Members who take the trouble to table questions could be shown some  courtesy and respect. An effort should be made to answer their questions.  Rather than ending up with having just three questions answered, perhaps in the  future we could devise some ways of ensuring that more questions are answered  in the House.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I appreciate what Lord Morrow is saying. The issue has been spoken of in the  House on many occasions. Lord Morrow is the Chairperson of the Committee on  Procedures, so it may be useful for his Committee to look at the issue to see  whether it would be at all possible to put a time limit on Ministers&rsquo; replies  to questions. Perhaps that would be the way forward. I always encourage the  House to look at issues such as this, and I always encourage Ministers, as far  as possible, to come to their answer as soon as they can. I believe that the  issue could be resolved, and I believe that the Committee on Procedures could  deal with it.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  Further to that point of order, I heard what you said, Mr Speaker, and I am  certain that the Committee on Procedures would be quite prepared to look at the  matter. Unfortunately, however, it cannot do so on its own. It can do so only  with the co-operation of Ministers and others. It is an important issue, and,  as the Chairperson of that Committee, I have no problems in looking into it.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I thank Lord Morrow for his point of order. I encourage his Committee to look  at the matter. As Speaker, I assure you that I will give the Committee on  Procedures all the help that it needs to look at the matter. It has concerned  me and exercised my mind for quite a while.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  Lord Morrow raised the point of order that I was going to raise, but thank you  for calling me, Mr Speaker.</p>

      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I am not sure why so many Members want to leave the Chamber. The debate started  so long ago that I cannot remember what I am angry about any more. However, I  will try my best. I will get myself worked up into a lather by the time that I  have finished speaking.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The patience of unionists with the development of a bill of  rights for Northern Ireland  is wearing very thin and has been tested to its limits. At every stage in the  process of developing a possible bill of rights for Northern Ireland and every time  that unionists have urged caution, they have been ignored. Every time that  unionists have argued for a minimalist approach, they have been ignored. Every  time that we have argued that the only remit that should be adhered to is that  in which the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland exist, we have  been ignored. Our good faith in engaging in the process has been thrown back in  our faces.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr McClarty] in the Chair)</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is not as though unionists have not engaged. Perhaps we  are coming from different perspectives and perhaps when we think of particular  circumstances we have one view and others have a different view, but I do not  think that anyone could stand up in all good conscience and say that unionists  have not attempted in good faith to engage in the process of developing a  possible bill of rights. That is what we have tried to do, and I hope and  believe that my contribution and those of others at different stages in the  process could be judged against that. Every time that we have tried to engage  in the process, that good faith has been thrown back in our faces. I think  particularly of the Bill of Rights Forum, which I was put on to for some crime  that I committed. I suffered some infringement of my rights in having to be on  the forum.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  That is why the Member is angry.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Mr Shannon is right: that is probably why I am angry and probably why I am  getting het up about it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That forum produced a raft of rights that went far beyond  its remit. It produced wacko ideas, such as raising the age of criminal  responsibility to 18, which was something that was never going to float in Northern Ireland.  It involved civic society to the extent that the mutual backscratching was such  that one person&rsquo;s hobby horse was included after another person&rsquo;s hobby horse  had been voted for. Unionists warned about the unacceptability of the Bill of  Rights Forum&rsquo;s proposals. Few decisions were achieved with consensus across the  parties represented on that forum, but all the warnings were ignored.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Unionist warnings were also ignored by the Human Rights  Commission when it produced its advice. A coach and horses was driven through  the remit, and it was not endorsed by the two commissioners who were clearly  from a unionist background. I have to say, in some ways, thank God for the NIO  and its response. I did not think that I would ever say that, but thank  goodness that the NIO saw that the proposals and advice of the Human Rights  Commission were ludicrous, crazy and out of step with what would be acceptable  in Northern Ireland. The NIO has produced &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: The  Member referred to unionists being ignored throughout the process. The SDLP had  no Members in the Chamber for a while, so it seems that we were being ignored  yet again. A Member suggested earlier that there was a massive public  groundswell regarding a bill of rights. Mr Hamilton is an experienced Member  and has been involved in politics for many years. In his many years of  canvassing, has anyone ever raised the issue of a bill of rights with him on  the doorstep?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  No one has raised the issue with me. Indeed, many of the issues that we get het  up about in the Stormont bubble are not those that concern the general public  in Northern Ireland.  We would do well to remember that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Like others, I have serious concerns about aspects of the  advice that was given by the Human Rights Commission. We have debated at length  in the Chamber and around the Building the issues of potential rights tourists  and judges making laws. I feel very dear about that matter. Having got powers  back to the Assembly to make our own laws and decisions, it would be perilous  to start handing powers away to judges to decide who receives what resources  and when. Only lawyers win in those circumstances. There are a couple of  lawyers in the House, and maybe they would be happy with that. However, our Government,  Departments and Ministers would be in court regularly to fight spurious cases  and arguments that were put against them.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The idea of having a separate bill of rights that goes far  beyond any other region of the United    Kingdom is costly and absolutely crazy.  Despite what campaigns on the side of buses and on billboards may claim, no one  in Northern Ireland  is having their rights denied to them. As Mr Weir said, many rights in this  country go far beyond those in place elsewhere in the United Kingdom,  the European Union and beyond. Some people want to create some sort of human  rights nirvana that goes far beyond what is realisable, realistic and practical  in this country.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have heard much harking back to age-old arguments about  rights in this country. However, those arguments do not stack up any longer,  and they are not realistic any longer. Those who are calling for an expansive,  maximalist bill of rights for Northern    Ireland would do well to stop ignoring the  views expressed consistently by unionists in all forums, including the  Assembly. If they want to progress any sort of bill of rights for Northern Ireland,  they would do well to remember those concerns.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to draw his remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  They would do well to start listening to unionists.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bresland</strong>:  As a democrat, I believe strongly in human rights. I believe in civil and  religious liberty for all in our society. That has always been my position,  and, in my role as a public representative, I will continue to do all that is  in my power to ensure that civil liberties are maintained for everyone,  irrespective of creed, colour or class.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In recent years, especially since the Belfast Agreement was  signed in 1998, an entire human rights industry has developed. That industry  has taken on a life of its own, and those who are part of it are determined to  ensure that it keeps growing. They are doing very well out of it, because it  costs millions of pounds. I have no problem with money being spent if it is  spent wisely and for the good of society. However, the human rights industry is  an appalling waste of taxpayers&rsquo; money.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is not often that I feel that I can praise the Northern  Ireland Office, but I am glad that it has resisted the pressure to promote the  sort of bill of rights that Monica McWilliams and the Human Rights Commission  want us to have. I go further than the Northern Ireland Office by arguing  strongly that we do not need a bill of rights at all. Northern Ireland  already has far too many layers of human rights legislation, directives and  quangos. We should cut back on rather than expand the number of layers.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Most worrying of all is the fact that those who are keen to  blow the human rights trumpet are not interested in human rights for everyone.  Sinn F&eacute;in and the SDLP tabled the motion and the amendment respectively. In the  House, both parties argued that Nelson McCausland should have no right of  conscience as a Minister of the Executive. In the face of that outrageous  challenge to human rights from Members opposite, the silence from Monica  McWilliams was deafening. When challenged, she failed to explain why she did  nothing to deal with the attack on civil and religious liberty by Sinn F&eacute;in,  the SDLP, the Alliance Party and the Green Party. Is it any wonder that those  in my party and people across Ulster  who are evangelical and Protestant have no confidence in the sincerity of the  party opposite or in those who promote the human rights agenda outside the  Chamber?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We do not need a bill of rights; it would not deliver a  fairer society. A bill of rights would mean that all rights would be equal but  some would be more equal than others. I am also concerned that the obsession  with rights means that there is little or no interest in responsibilities.  There must be a balance between rights and responsibilities.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In short, I regard the proposed bill of rights as a threat  to civil and religious liberties, and I oppose the motion and the amendment.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  On several occasions, I have spoken in the Chamber about a bill of rights for Northern Ireland.  In so far as the bill of rights has not changed, neither has my opinion of it,  and I will illustrate why. A few weeks ago, a Christian gentleman came into my  office. He was confused about whether, as a Christian, he should support the  bill of rights by signing and returning a letter that had been sent to him. As  a Christian, he believes that the right to partake in activities, the right of  his church to charity status and other similar rights are being attacked. He  wondered whether the bill of rights would offer his church some protection. In  other words, having seen all those attacks on his church and his beliefs, he  wondered about the intention of a bill of rights. However, the bill of rights,  as it stands and as it is perceived, would disadvantage that gentleman.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, Dolores Kelly is not in the Chamber at  present. She said that she could not understand why there is confusion. There  is confusion because people from the evangelical churches wonder what is going  on. The Christian gentleman was unaware of our concern that the recommendation  of the Human Rights Commission, which is that the Government respond to the  conclusions of a UN Committee on Discrimination against Women, could provide a  back door to the legalisation of abortion. Although the Human Rights Commission  does not recommend a right to abortion, it fails to recommend that the unborn  child&rsquo;s right to life be included in the bill of rights. That is one of several  grey areas in the bill. I told the gentleman about that concern and left him to  decide, based on all the information before him, whether he should sign the  letter. Many people face the same problem. It is a serious issue but one that  Dolores Kelly has not acknowledged. People are bombarded with media advertising  that cites some but not all of the facts, and they rely on Members to bring to  life the real issues.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The fect at thair ir a clatter o&rsquo; consairns aboot this bill  an&rsquo; at bes fer wie I an&rsquo; mae pairty es a whole ir sarious gled at the Norlin  Airlan Offaice hes rejected sae monie o&rsquo; the socio-economic richts.

      <p class="B3BodyText">There are many concerns about the bill, and that is why I  and my party as a whole welcome the Northern Ireland Office&rsquo;s rejection of many  of the socio-economic rights that are included therein. Those issues should be  decided in this Chamber by elected representatives. It is fundamental to  democracy that the people vote to have their views represented on a range of  such issues. They should not be left for unelected judges to decide.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Evangelical Alliance Northern Ireland said that the bill of  rights should steer away from overly detailed and restrictive legislation. Its  national director, Stephen   Cave, said:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Responsibility towards others, alongside the  protection of rights, is critical to a Christian understanding of a free and  healthy society. But if the emphasis is too strongly on individual rights,  there is the potential to fracture rather than reconcile, and we feel this is  the danger with this report. A focus on shared responsibilities, on the other  hand, would have the potential to transform society through hope, imagination  and active citizenship. There are undoubtedly positive proposals within the final  report, for example on the issue of human trafficking.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I agree that some of the proposals are good. Mr  Cave added:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;However, we believe this, along with many other  proposals, would be better dealt with in the context of the Northern Ireland  Assembly.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Our representatives on the forum made it clear that the  recommendations were much too wide and went outside the remit that was  established in the Belfast Agreement and the Northern Ireland Act 1998. That  also applied to the vast majority of recommendations from the Human Rights  Commission. Most of the recommended rights in the report from the commission  were not specific to the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland, which was the  remit given to the commissioner. I have spoken at length about that issue  during previous debates, and my remarks are recorded in Hansard.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The bill is supposed to reference rights that are not  already catered for. It is not supposed to simply rehash legislation without  the democratic process that should accompany any change of legislation for the  key objectives of very narrow interest groups, as opposed to the majority of  people in the Province. That is the key issue for a great many of us who speak  on the matter.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP still has concerns about some of the  recommendations in the consultation document and will respond in detail to that  consultation process in due course. Suffice it to say that the concerns raised  in the Chamber during past discussions on the bill of rights have not been  addressed to a satisfactory degree. We will continue to ensure that any bill of  rights is fit for the purpose for which it is designed &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to conclude his remarks.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  It must not be a means to chip away at the moral fabric of the society that  makes Northern Ireland  the country and nation that it is today.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I do not know how many times I have to remind Members not to use electronic  equipment in the Chamber. It seems that it is the usual suspects. There is  interference in the sound system, which affects Hansard&rsquo;s recording of the  debates. Please switch off your electronic equipment.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  At the beginning of this debate, Martina Anderson rightly referred to the comments  of Chris McCrudden, who was one of the best friends of rights and rights  protections in the North over the past 30 years. I am sure that Chris McCrudden  would want to very strongly identify with the comments that I made in this  Chamber previously when I quoted Frank Wright, who was a lecturer at Queen&rsquo;s  University but, unfortunately, is now dead. Many years ago, Frank Wright wrote:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;when conflicts are fully developed, they revolve  around issues of law, order and justice&rdquo;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">He applied that thesis to the North. He said that,  at any time, the conflict in the North revolved around issues of law, order and  justice.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Out of that analysis came acceptance in the Good Friday  Agreement, which was endorsed by the people of Ireland, that issues of law, order  and justice had to be addressed in order to resolve the conflict. Over and  above its political dimensions, one had to get right issues of human rights,  equality and policing and justice. That is why the Good Friday Agreement  established mechanisms to deal with policing and justice, rights and equality.  That confirmed that there were particular circumstances in Northern Ireland  that required particular measures and laws. That is where the whole bill of  rights issue comes from, and from where the quotation about the &ldquo;particular  circumstances of Northern    Ireland&rdquo; is sourced. Until John Reid, the  then Secretary of State, raised an issue about what those words meant, nobody  disagreed with them. Nobody challenged that &ldquo;particular circumstances&rdquo; in Northern Ireland  should be interpreted narrowly. Everyone accepted that they should be  interpreted to fit the circumstances that existed in Northern Ireland. I find it  disingenuous of the unionist parties today and recently to rely on that clause  to mean one thing when it was quite clearly intended to mean another.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not understand the Alliance Party&rsquo;s view. What  reassurance is it to people in Northern    Ireland that the Alliance Party today said  that it is totally unrealistic for the Human Rights Commission and others to  argue for an expansive bill of rights? What a withering put-down of the rights  constituency in Northern    Ireland. What a withering statement of  intent from those with pretensions to become Justice Minister.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">At the heart of the debate, there is an inconsistency in the  approach adopted by the DUP. On one hand, Simon  Hamilton argues for a minimalist approach. He further argues that no one in Northern Ireland  is having their rights denied to them. If that is the case, why does his party,  rightfully, put a proposal for a charter for the rights of victims into the  Hillsborough arrangements? How do Simon  Hamilton and the DUP reconcile today what happened to the Devlin family last  week, when they said that their rights had been denied by the Public  Prosecution Service?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">More critically, there is a tension between Simon Hamilton and Jimmy Spratt, because Mr Spratt  said, rightly, that rights are hugely important. He went further by saying that  50% of what the Human Rights Commission proposed would apply to people in Britain. He did  not discount that 50%. He did not say that it was wrong. He did not say that  that 50% should not be there. He said that it applied equally to people in Britain. The  DUP cannot have it both ways. It cannot say that it wants a minimalist approach  and that no rights are denied to anybody in Northern Ireland, while Jimmy  Spratt says, cautiously rather than expansively, but, nonetheless, I  acknowledge it &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. Does the Member agree that that is not true  of the whole of the unionist, Protestant population, given that 80% of the  people surveyed by the Human Rights Consortium agreed that a bill of rights was  needed?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  That is a good point of evidence, and what Jimmy Spratt said in the debate is a  good point of reference. I say to Jimmy Spratt and the DUP that 100% of what  the Human Rights Commission said applies, rather than 50%. Nonetheless, is it  not better today to create certainty and avoid doubt? Given how the Tories and  Labour are beginning to unpick the Human Rights Commission, is it not better  today to start afresh? Is it not better to take Jimmy Spratt&rsquo;s stance and to  start to implement the 50% of recommendations? If we do not do so, we will end  up with much less than 50%. I want to legislate for 100% of the HRC&rsquo;s  recommendations, but the DUP has a responsibility to act on its words.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the support of Members who spoke in favour of the  motion and the amendment. I agree with Danny Kennedy that what the Secretary of  State has done is a stunning rejection of the Human Rights Commission&rsquo;s  proposals. Much more than that, it is a stunning act of high-handedness by the  Secretary of State in adopting that attitude.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member will draw his remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  The Secretary of State should withdraw the consultation and start afresh.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. On behalf of my party, I call for  Members to support the motion and the SDLP&rsquo;s very acceptable amendment. I thank  the SDLP for tabling the amendment, which undoubtedly adds to the substance of  the motion in that it calls for a more expansive discussion. All Members who  have spoken in the debate should seek to maximise the rights of the people we  collectively represent.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I was going to refer to some of Danny Kennedy&rsquo;s remarks  from earlier in the debate, but I suggest that the Member has insulted the  House this afternoon. He admitted entering the Chamber without having listened  to any Member&rsquo;s contribution. Speaking from a script, Mr Kennedy went on to  describe the debate as divisive, and he has not turned up for the remainder of  the debate. That is why I believe that Mr Kennedy&rsquo;s conduct insults the House.  I entirely understand that he may be away on other business, but he could have  had a colleague address the matter that he addressed so scantily.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Like Mr Attwood, I am disappointed in the Alliance Party  saying, through Stephen Farry, that it is unable to support the entire motion  or the amendment. I understand that Alliance Party Members may abstain in the  vote and that the Alliance Party supports the concept if not necessarily the  detail of what is proposed. Nevertheless, I will be disappointed if the  Alliance Party does not feel able to subscribe to the aim of maximising the  rights of people whom we all, including the Alliance Party, represent.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A number of Members, albeit flippantly, referred to  themselves as survivors of the Bill of Rights Forum. Given that it concluded  its business in March 2008, those Members have had two years&rsquo; respite. However,  we are still waiting for a substantive move forward. Indeed, due to the delay  caused by the NIO, we are still involved in a consultation process. I was a  member of the Bill of Rights Forum&rsquo;s criminal justice and victims working group,  and, although it was a fairly intensive period of discussions, I found those  discussions to be very educational. The working group was inclusive, involving  representatives from a number of parties and sectors &mdash; including the DUP,  although it was not an elected member &mdash; and it took oral and written  submissions from various organisations.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Although unionist political parties are colder to and less  embracing of the concept of rights, I subscribe to the view, as a result of  direct experience, that unionist people from wider civic society want the  maximum number of rights to be enshrined in law, so that we can all benefit  from them. I appeal to the unionist parties. Members have reflected on the past  30 or 40 years or however long they wish to go back. I ask other parties to  consider this point: no matter what your perspective is on the past 30, 40 or  even 100 years, surely the lessons from and our collective experiences of the  conflict and disturbances underwrite the need to maximise everybody&rsquo;s rights.  Regardless of whether we are talking about the right to life or to a decent  quality of life, surely we want to ensure that people have those rights and  that they are enshrined in law.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I dare say that there are Members in the Chamber who  represent victims of the conflict and people who have been bereaved as a result  of it, but there are also people in this city, living not too far from here,  who must use outside toilets and do not have running water in their home. If  Members were to knock on those people&rsquo;s doors and ask them whether they should  have rights, I imagine that they would respond with a resounding yes. Indeed,  they would probably ask us what the heck we have been doing and why they are  not able to avail themselves of those rights already.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A number of unionist colleagues spoke about taking a  minimalist approach to rights. I do not understand what that means, although I  suspect it means that people should have as few rights as possible. Most  Members are extremely diligent on behalf of their constituents, so surely none  of them can convince me or themselves that they can advance their constituents&rsquo;  causes if there are fewer rights. Most of us, as elected representatives, argue  for our constituents on the basis that they have a right to a home etc. Therefore,  I urge Members to reconsider why they are advocating a minimalist approach to  rights.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Other Members argued why we should reject the NIO&rsquo;s  proposition, which has been issued for consultation. Let us remind ourselves  that the call for a bill of rights emerged from the St Andrews Agreement, which  parties subscribed to and thought was a very good idea. The outworking of that  agreement was a substantive and brilliant piece of work. Not everybody has to  agree with everything that was put forward, but neither did the Human Rights  Commission have to accept everything from the Bill of Rights Forum.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">There were some changes to the Human Rights  Commission&rsquo;s final submission, and people can select which submissions or  recommendations they wish to support more or less. Nevertheless, there is an  opportunity for all of us to say collectively that we need to maximise the  rights of all our people, because, whether we like it or not, a lot of what  happened for many years was wrapped up in whether or not there was a denial of rights  or whether people felt that they had no justice or no recourse to justice.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said earlier, I do not want to take issue with  people&rsquo;s perspectives on the past 30 or 40 years or, indeed, the past 100  years. I am simply making the point that that experience should drive us to  maximise rights on behalf of all people, because that is one sure way to ensure  that we will have no question of any return and no justification of any return  to the days of conflict. No citizen here, young or old, no matter what their  political beliefs may be, would have their rights denied, because their rights  would be enshrined from here on in.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I urge Members to consider that the extended deadline for  the consultation on the NIO&rsquo;s recommendations gives us an opportunity to reject  those recommendations as minimalist. They have been described as being  pitifully limited, unacceptable and disrespectful. I would argue that the NIO&rsquo;s  contribution to the debate has been disrespectful, because people from right  across our society &mdash; young and old, from different Churches and backgrounds,  secular and otherwise, and from different sectors, ethnic minorities and so on  &mdash; have made massive contributions to the debate. However, the NIO has belatedly  and very begrudgingly sought to reduce the rights that people have already  secured over the decades; indeed, many of us suspect that it would seek to  reduce those rights further.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, I urge people to reconsider the notion of  seeking to minimise the rights to which people should be entitled and to push  instead for maximum rights. I believe that, if we were to knock on the doors of  the people whom we represent, they would call on us to maximise their rights.  Representatives from every sector &mdash; trade unions, the Churches and so on &mdash; have  been very quick and vociferous in calling on us to maximise the rights of the  citizens whom we all collectively represent. The Assembly can come together in  unanimity to support the maximising of people&rsquo;s rights. That would be an  important legacy for Members of this particular Assembly.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In order to secure and copper-fasten a just peace and to  build on the promise and hopes of the Good Friday Agreement and the St Andrews  Agreement, we should reject the NIO consultation proposals and support the need  to ensure that we maximise the rights of all the citizens whom we represent.</p>

The proposer will have 10 minutes in which to propose the motion and 10  minutes in which to make a winding-up speech. Two amendments have been selected  and published on the Marshalled List. The proposer of each amendment will have  10 minutes in which to propose and five minutes in which to make a winding-up  speech. All other Members who wish to speak will have five minutes.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes the renewal for one final year of  50:50 recruitment to the police in Northern Ireland; looks forward to the next  substantial recruitment competition when, for the first time in a decade,  Protestant applicants will face no barriers on the grounds of perceived religious  affiliation in the process of being considered for a career in the police.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion is timely and important, given the fact that it  has now been a decade throughout which a sizeable section of our community has  been discriminated against on grounds of religion when applying for posts with  the police in Northern    Ireland. One good thing that can be said is  that, when the Westminster Government extended the 50:50 recruitment process,  they did so for one final year.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That makes it no less important that we should look forward  to the elimination of that discriminatory practice, which has occurred over the  past 10 years. We should prepare for the time when every applicant can apply  and expect to be treated solely on his or her merits.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP has pointed out the recruitment problems of the  past, and we will do so in the future because many thousands of people are  affected. I am grateful to my colleague the Member for South Belfast Mr Spratt  for assisting me with figures on applicants for the past number of years. In  the past five years alone, over 40,000 people have applied to join the police.  Therefore, this discrimination has been practised not against a small number of  individuals but against a significant number of people in the community.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I note that the SDLP has tabled an amendment, which, far  from trying to end the practice, seeks to continue it. I do not understand how  any political party that aspires to fairness and equality could not only be  against ending discrimination but want it to continue. That is what the SDLP  amendment proposes.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Some people argue that, because for many decades, Roman  Catholics &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Only one Member should be on his or her feet. Continue, Mr  Campbell.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  The argument goes that, because Roman Catholics have been substantially  under-represented in the police over many years, there has to be some sort of  device to try to counter that under-representation. That does not take account  of the fact that the rationale for the under-representation was the murder  campaign that was carried out by the Provisional IRA and, before that, the old  IRA for between four and five decades.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Once the violence and intimidation stopped, the numbers of  people from the Roman Catholic community who applied to join the police  increased substantially. Before the introduction of the 50:50 recruitment  policy, 8% of the police were Roman Catholics, and, as I said, the primary  reason for that was that Roman Catholics were at risk of being shot if they  applied to join the police. Once that threat was lifted, the numbers of  Catholics applying to join the police went up to over 20% and then to over 40%.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The key point is that, even if there had not been a 50:50  recruitment process, the numbers of Roman Catholics who joined the police would  have increased. Over 40% of the people who applied to join the police were  Roman Catholics, and, provided the merit principle was applied in both  communities, one might expect over 40% of the people who applied to be  successful. Therefore, the percentage of Roman Catholics in the police would  have gone up anyway, irrespective of the 50:50 rule.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The abandonment of the 50:50 rule would not have diminished  the number of Roman Catholic applicants in any meaningful way, and it would  have meant that there was not an effect on the Protestant community. I am sure  that public representatives who live and work in the Protestant community can  testify to the fact that the 50:50 rule causes resentment in the Protestant  community. Many individuals who wanted a career in the police have come to  constituency offices and said that they sat the required exams and were told  that they were a suitable candidate only to get a letter telling them that,  under the 50:50 policy, they could not be recruited. For many people in the  Protestant community, that is tantamount to saying that Protestants need not  apply.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, the application of an open-ended merit principle  would have had little effect on the increase in the numbers of Roman Catholic  recruits because 40% of the applicants came from that community. In fact, I met  Mr Goggins, our security Minister, and senior police officers two weeks ago,  and I was informed that by the end of next month 28&middot;7% of the Police Service  will be Roman Catholic, which is up from 8% just over 10 years ago.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Many people try to testify that the rationale for the 50:50  recruitment policy is under-representation, yet there is a significant  under-representation of the Protestant community in other aspects of public  service in Northern Ireland.  I never hear the SDLP proposing the introduction of a 50:50 rule in the Housing  Executive, even though Roman Catholics are more likely to be police officers  than Protestants are to be housing officers. There is never a proposal,  suggestion or hint that we should move to 50:50 recruitment in the Housing  Executive, yet, as I say, there is more merit in that, because more than 40% of  those applying to join the Police Service are Catholic, whereas only 36% of  those employed by the Housing Executive are Protestant.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It seems that, on numerous occasions, there are those who  take a blinkered approach and say that they want to address one type of  disadvantage but, in other instances, they are quite happy to accommodate one  group and disadvantage another. We must move forward to a brighter and better  day where there is equality of opportunity. That will only be seen, felt and  experienced when people who apply for a job in the police know that they will  get it on the basis of their being the best qualified person for the job and  that their religious persuasion &mdash; or perceived religious persuasion &mdash; is  totally and utterly irrelevant to the outcome of their application.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The numbers speak for themselves: 40,000-plus applications  have come through the system. At the meeting that I mentioned earlier, Mr  Goggins and senior police officers said that I should tell my community to keep  applying for policing jobs even if they had been turned down last year and this  year. It might be good enough to tell people to keep trying and applying, but  the point is that they should not have to keep reapplying only to suffer  discrimination year on year. The discrimination ought to end.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">On 8 February 2010, a latter-day democrat and one-time  terrorist said:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;under no circumstances would I tolerate any section  of our community being discriminated against because of religion.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Official Report, Vol 48,  No 1, p28, col 1].</span></p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The man who said that, in answer to a question that  I asked in the Chamber, was Martin McGuinness.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind Members that mobile phones should be switched off. If  Members refuse to acknowledge that request, I will simply refuse to call them  to speak.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I call Mr Attwood to move amendment No 1.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I trust that that is confirmation that my mobile phone is off. <span class="Italic">[Laughter]</span></p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I beg to move amendment No 1: Leave out all after &ldquo;renewal&rdquo;  and insert</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;of 50:50 recruitment to the PSNI; believes that  special measures are still needed to achieve a police service which is  representative of the community as recommended by the Patten report; and  recommends that 50:50 recruitment should continue after the Catholic community  background reaches 30% for police officers, to help bring about the &lsquo;closer  resemblance to that of the community as a whole&rsquo; in the composition of both  police officers and civilian staff respectively.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP and I acknowledge that there are different views  about 50:50 recruitment, but I do not want the unionist party to have a difference  of opinion from us in our belief that one of the single greatest achievements &mdash;  arguably, the single greatest achievement &mdash; since the Good Friday Agreement is  what the parties have done in respect of the new beginning for policing.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have said before, and I will say again, that the  contribution to policing by the unionist parties has been their finest hour  over the past number of years. I have sat on the Policing Board from the  beginning, so I know that much of the business of the Patten report, the changes  to policing and the Policing Board sat heavily with the unionist parties.  Despite the difficulties that we all had in bringing about the new beginning to  policing and implementing the Patten recommendations, unionism never walked  from the board; it played its full role.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Even when the institutions in the North were suspended,  when there was political turbulence and when other parties were not  participating in the new beginning to policing, the SDLP, the UUP and the DUP  never walked off the pitch. I acknowledge that, whatever our differences about  50:50 recruitment, my differences with unionism over the past 10 years are not  about what the unionist parties contributed to the new beginning to policing.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">More than that, nothing that we say in the Chamber tonight  should diminish in any way the bravery and leadership shown by those  individuals who joined the PSNI and those who applied to join it over the past  15 or 16 recruitment exercises. We realise the level of threat that police  officers are under and the number of attacks on them, including those on an  officer who was working in west Belfast  and on officers in other parts of the North over recent days. Nothing in the  difference of opinion on 50:50 recruitment should take away from the  contribution that those officers have made.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That is why I take issue with Gregory Campbell&rsquo;s assertion  that 50:50 recruitment sends out the message that no Protestant need apply. If  Protestant applicants had taken Mr Campbell&rsquo;s advice, the 63% of applicants  from a non-Catholic or Protestant background would not have applied. Like the  Catholic community, the Protestant community learned a lesson from the Patten  report that Protestants, Catholic and others should apply. They did so, because  63% of applicants to the police over the past 11 years have come from a  non-Catholic or Protestant background, and 37% have come from a Catholic  background.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Those figures speak eloquently to those who have said over  the past 10 years that no Protestant need apply. Similarly, those figures speak  eloquently to those who say today that no Catholic need apply due to the terror  threat. Through those figures, people are saying boldly and courageously what  they think of those threats to the community and of those who threaten them.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  Although it is very gratifying to hear you congratulating unionists &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member address all his remarks through the Chair?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  It is very gratifying to hear the Member welcoming the fact that unionists  stayed on the Policing Board. However, he must acknowledge that, for decades,  the SDLP deliberately boycotted the Police Authority. Perhaps if the SDLP had  joined the Police Authority and demonstrated the level of commitment that it is  now prepared to show to the Policing Board, we would not have as many police  graves.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  The Member knows the response to that. He knows that the RUC, because it so  substantially reflected the unionist view of the world, was an arm of the state  and was not an impartial vehicle for the delivery of civilian policing. That is  not my view; the Patten report stated that the RUC was an arm of the state,  which did not treat all its citizens and all its communities equally. That is  why we had the Good Friday Agreement and the Patten report, which have created  a new threshold and template for the nature of policing. Therefore, bringing up  the Police Authority is a red herring, because the problem with policing was  not the Police Authority; it was the nature, the culture and the practice of  policing and the experience of nationalism over too many years and in too many  instances.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We want the retention of 50:50 recruitment because it  honours the Patten recommendations properly. The British Government are  disingenuous in their consultation document on 50:50 recruitment. In the  foreword, the Minister of State, Paul Goggins, says:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;we still have a short distance to go before we have a  police service which is representative of the community.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">In the British Government&rsquo;s opinion, &ldquo;represent&shy;ative  of the community&rdquo; means 30%. That is not representative of the community. I  accept that substantial progress has been made towards that objective. However,  based on the 2001 census figures, which showed the Catholic community at 44% of  the total, it is disingenuous for the British Government to suggest that we  have only a &ldquo;short distance to go&rdquo; before we have a representative police  service.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Patten report set a different standard, which is more  fundamental than the words of the British Government. Patten recommended 50:50  for 10 years and said:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;We have not taken our model beyond ten years &hellip; a  judgment would need to be made as to whether special measures were still needed  to achieve a police service representative of the community or whether this  could now be expected to develop naturally. Either way we envisage that the  composition of the police should continue to move towards a closer resemblance  to that of the community as a whole.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Patten was telling the British Government that what was  needed in order to create a representative police service, up to 44% Catholic  on current trends, and what is needed to build on the significant successes of  Patten and policing over the last 10 years, is the maintenance of 50:50  recruitment. Based on current application and recruitment rates, it will be at  least 30 years before the uniformed side of the PSNI comprises 44% Catholics.  On the civilian side, where Catholic representation has moved up to only 17% in  the past 10 years, it could take 50, 60 or 70 years, based on current applicant  and recruitment rates, before Catholic membership reaches 44%.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We are telling the British Government, as we are telling  everybody, that, given the success of policing over the past 10 years, we  should try to accelerate the overall balance as quickly as possible to deepen  confidence, build strength and increase representation. If we do that through  50:50 recruitment, Catholic membership will reach 44% in less than 20 years. If  we do not use 50:50 recruitment, it could take 30 years or more &mdash; and longer on  the civilian side. That is not credible or sustainable and is not the right way  to go. We appreciate, Mr Campbell <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; ">&#8213;</span> through you, Mr Deputy Speaker <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; ">&#8213;</span> that a small number of Protestants have not been recruited to the PSNI over the  past 10 years because of the 50:50 recruitment policy. However, it is a small  number, and a small number of Catholics have benefited as a result.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP believes, as the European authorities believe,  that that positive method of recruitment is necessary in a situation where  there has been such a historic imbalance of Catholics in the RUC. That  imbalance was not caused only by republican organisations&rsquo; threats against Catholics  who joined the police force, but the nature and culture of the RUC and the  experience of the Catholic community. We do not diminish the sense of hurt and  disappointment of a small number of Protestants who have not been recruited.  However, there is also a deep sense of disappointment among thousands of  Catholics and Protestants who have not been recruited for the reason that so  many people want to join the police.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should draw his remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  We should not jeopardise that.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  beg to move amendment No 2: leave out all after &ldquo;when&rdquo; and insert</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;all applicants, irrespective of their actual or perceived  background, can be eligible for recruitment solely on merit.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party welcomes today&rsquo;s debate; it is a debate  that the Assembly needs to have. Our party has consistently opposed the use of  50:50 quotas as set out in the Patten report and in subsequent legislation.  That has been our long-standing position for the past decade and longer.  Despite that, our support for policing reform in society has been clear.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There are three issues that inform my party&rsquo;s opposition to  the quotas. First, we believe that they are unnecessary; secondly, we see them  as being divisive; and thirdly, we believe that they have questionable legality  &mdash; I will come to those in a moment. We approach the subject largely from a  liberal perspective, and our amendment flows from that point of view.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We are somewhat concerned about the language that is used  in the DUP motion, because it refers to the needs of Protestants in relation to  the way in which quotas are working out, as opposed to the interests of the  whole community. We believe that our amendment offers a much more rounded  approach to the issue, rather than focusing on something that benefits  Catholics or works against the interests of Protestants. Quotas work against  the whole community.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  I accept what the Member says about the terms of the motion, but does he accept  that it is worded as it is because it is the Protestant community that is  discriminated against in the first place?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  do not. I appreciate where Mr Campbell is coming from, but the point that I am  making is that quotas work against the entire community, whether one is  Protestant, Catholic or from a different background. That is the essence that  we need to capture in the thrust of the debate. The quota system is not simply  a Protestant versus Catholic system; it comprises a Catholic quota and a  Protestant and other, or non-Catholic, quota. Although, in the main, the people  who are affected negatively by the system may be from a Protestant background,  people from ethnic minority backgrounds also suffer as a consequence. The  Police Service of Northern Ireland and other police services elsewhere in the UK have  questions to answer about their representation of people from different ethnic  minority backgrounds. However, the interests of people from such backgrounds  are neglected because the system includes them in what is perceived to be the  majority community in Northern    Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  Does the Member accept that the number of people that he is talking about who  have applied to be recruited in the past five years is so negligible that it is  very difficult even to gather statistics on it? In fact, there may have been as  few as 12 individuals.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  would say, rather, that the recruitment of those 12 individuals makes my point  for me. They may be a very small percentage of the overall number of recruits,  but we have to reflect that, in Northern    Ireland, we have a much more diverse  society. In particular, in circumstances in which people from ethnic minorities  have particular problems, having a representative police force is all the more  important. A situation in which efforts to make the Police Service more  representative are counter-productive, because the barriers are set even higher  than elsewhere, does not make sense.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  The Member said that the Alliance Party was opposed to 50:50 recruitment from  the outset and that it wanted it wound up as quickly as possible. Will he  explain how we would have got to the situation that we have today, in which, at  least, Catholics represent 28% of the Police Service? The current recruitment  round has an application rate from Catholics of 38%. If that continues in  perpetuity, we will never get above even 38% of Catholics in the PSNI, which is  far from being representative of the population as a whole. How, otherwise,  would we have got to the position that we are in today, and how does he see us  ever getting to a situation in which we have a Police Service that is  representative of the whole population?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  The answer to that is quite simple; representation will be achieved through  recruitment on the basis of merit. Obviously, that will take us slightly  longer, but the point is that the efforts that we are making to get a balanced  and representative Police Service must be sustainable and not divisive. There  are some extremely strong feelings in the House, which, no doubt, will be  expressed as the debate goes on, and those feelings will reflect how the issue  is viewed on the streets of Northern    Ireland. It is certainly something that I  have picked up on as I go round the doorsteps as an Alliance Party  representative. However, I want to focus the debate on the interests of the  whole community, rather than making it a Protestant or Catholic issue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is far too much labelling going on in this society.  We have people who come from open, mixed and multiple backgrounds who do not  see themselves as coming from a single identity, and it is important that we  represent their point of view as well. There is a notion in society that our  political identities, national identities and religious identities, all  reinforce one another. For many people, that is not the case, and we should  celebrate that fact, rather than constantly trying to pigeonhole people.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">When the SDLP spokespeople who talk about the justice  portfolio describe David Ford as a unionist, they are making a sectarian  comment. David Ford is perfectly entitled to base his politics around an issue  other than the union or a united Ireland and to not represent a  sectoral interest of society. For him to be pigeonholed is sectarian, whether  the SDLP accepts it or not. That is a fact.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The other aspect of how quotas can be counter&shy;productive in  trying to achieve a representative police force is that they can fail to  reflect the diversity within the monolithic blocks that people have based  public policy around, particularly in the Catholic, nationalist section of  society. We want to ensure that people from a wide range of backgrounds come  forward; not necessarily those from an SDLP political viewpoint who may be on  the more moderate end of the political spectrum. We want people from a much  more republican background to come forward also. The problem with the simplistic  use of quotas is that it does not reflect the type of diversity that may exist  at grassroots level in society.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The policy is flawed, even in the stated objectives of  trying to achieve a representative and balanced outcome. To use a parallel in  looking at the use of quotas, affirmative action has been taken by universities  in North America where there is a heavy  emphasis on trying to increase ethnic minority participation in classes.  Evidence has shown that people who have benefited from those quotas tend to be  drawn more from a middle class background and from those who already have the  required qualifications. The process means that people in the more hard line  ghetto areas who have not had the opportunity to reach a high level of  education miss out. Quotas can be a simplistic way of trying to address the  type of issue that people are seeking to address.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  How do you address the imbalance?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  am happy to give way. Do you wish me to give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  It is a very simple question: how do you address the imbalance?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Please refer all remarks through the Chair. Dr Farry, I will  decide.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  am sorry, Mr Deputy Speaker?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I will decide whether someone is allowed to take the Floor.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I am  sorry; I was under the impression that Mr Maginness wanted me to give way. I  was confused, given that he was speaking from a sedentary position.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There are three problems. First, the matter is divisive: it  polarises people and puts labels on recruits. It also detracts from the pure  merit principle. Although I accept that all applicants have to meet the minimum  criteria of ability, people are not subsequently treated purely according to  their ranking within that merit. Secondly, there have been diversions from  European law, in that the British Government have had to seek a number of  derogations from European Union directives in order to proceed with the use of  quotas. Thirdly, to make a point that may address the concern raised by Mr  O&rsquo;Loan and Mr Maginness, I believe that quotas are unnecessary, as well as  being counterproductive and divisive. Other measures can be taken to make  services such as the police service more representative of society. There are  other affirmative action measures short of the use of quotas. My party&rsquo;s  argument has always been that that is where the emphasis in public policy  should lie, which means being aggressive in reaching under-represented  communities and going into schools in a proactive manner and encouraging  applications from the sector or sectors that are under-represented. I want to  see a balanced intake of people applying for jobs in the police and elsewhere.  If we have that balance, we will have a workforce that is reflective of society  over time.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member draw his remarks to a close?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: It  may not happen overnight, but we have to proceed in a way that is sustainable.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, LeasCheann Comhairle. I ask Members to reject the motion,  support amendment No 1, and reject amendment No 2. I ask this on behalf of my  party under the requirements of the Good Friday Agreement, the spirit and  intentions of Patten, and our party mandate from our special Ard-Fheis in 2007.  I will go further and say that we should do this in the overarching spirit of  policing with the community, which is a principle of Patten and of the  legislation that governs policing today.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A number of Members understand fully that, in recent years,  there has been an ongoing debate about how to embed the entire spirit of  policing with the community as an integral part of the way in which the Police  Service does its job. We hope that that project was given a lot of momentum by  last year&rsquo;s appointment of Matt Baggott as Chief Constable of the PSNI. He has  been acknowledged, certainly before taking up his new post, as a renowned  expert and strong advocate of policing with the community. However, policing  with the community cannot be done unless a police service is reflective of the  community that it wants to serve.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Good Friday Agreement talked about a new beginning. I  accept that, across the different communities, there are many sensitivities regarding  policing in the past number of decades. By the same token, the Good Friday  Agreement was endorsed by the majority of people across the North and, indeed,  the whole island. Most people of goodwill have acknowledged, in recent times,  that it is the only show in town. It is the way to go, and we continue to build  on its delivery.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Good Friday Agreement also talked about providing a new  beginning for policing and creating a police service capable of attracting and  sustaining support from the whole community. Flowing out of that was what  became the Patten Commission. The Patten Commission made some excellent recommendations,  but it did not go far enough. Members have mentioned the Patten report in the  House this afternoon and referred to the magical figure of 30%. However, 30% is  still not representative of the size of the Catholic community. Like others, I  do not like dealing in the crude, headline terminology of Catholics and  Protestants, but that is the kind of society that we lived in. It is almost  shorthand for community representativeness, but it does not go far enough.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Members need to know what they are talking about in  debates. The Patten Commission said that if a proactive 50:50 recruitment  policy were adopted, there would be a representation from the Catholic  community of between 29% and 33% within 10 years. Patten went on to say that,  in parallel with that, recruitment could be carried out without any cap up to  1,000 Catholic officers in the part-time service of the PSNI. Those two  measures, in parallel, would bring about a 40% Catholic representation in the  PSNI in 10 years, which is a little bit closer to community representation than  we are today and will be next year.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The British Government &mdash; as they always do in matters such  as the bill of rights, which we debated earlier &mdash; subverted aspects of the  Patten report and did not deliver on the spirit and intention of Patten. To  deliver the type of representative police service to which this community is  entitled, the 50:50 recruitment policy and other measures are needed. We tried  to table an amendment that went further by calling for the retention of the 50:50  recruitment process and any other measure that might be necessary to ensure  that, within a reasonable period, the PSNI, in all aspects, was representative  of the community that it purports to serve.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Indeed, I argue that the PSNI will never fully have the  entire confidence of this community until it is representative of that  community. That is a job of work that, thankfully, many people in the PSNI  openly advocate. It makes sense, and it is another argument that Patten made  about efficiency and effectiveness. If the Police Service is not  representative, it will not attract support from the wider community.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I also argue that the motion is inherently sectarian,  because &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to draw his remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  For every claim that Protestants are discriminated against because of the 50:50  recruitment practice, there are thousands of Catholics who have been  discriminated against. It is not a Protestant Police Service, so every person  should be appointed to an officer job on merit and on a 50:50 basis.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  The Ulster Unionist Party has long had difficulty with any form of  discrimination, even positive discrimination. It creates a long-term cancer in  our society and makes people feel that they are not being treated fairly. There  are also issues relating to the legal powers.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Maginness challenged a number of Members and asked how  we will ever get to 50:50 or 40% Catholic representation if only 38% of the  people applying to the Police Service are from the Catholic tradition. The  answer is that many, many more people apply than there are places available. It  can, therefore, be achieved through the application of simple mathematics,  albeit in a different way. If Members want to know how to increase the number  of Roman Catholics who serve in the police, a key point is that people should  stop shooting and targeting those who serve. That is the real reason that we  did not have balance in the past. The RUC was never opposed to having people  from different traditions in its ranks.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Does the Member agree that even in the most peaceful of times in Northern Ireland,  the percentage of Catholics in the RUC never exceeded 11%? Why was that the  case?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  One must ask why that was. When people started off with the RUC, it was with  good intent.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am surprised that the SDLP tabled such an amendment,  because it appears irrelevant. The number of recruits that we need in coming  years is not 400 annually but 100 annually. One begins to think how long it  will take to change the situation. Surely we have reached a level of maturity  in the PSNI and elsewhere, whereby we can rely on the spirit of generosity and  righteousness, and appoint recruits on merit.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Attwood was a little selective in reading out the Patten  recommendations. Members have danced around the issue. Even Mr Alex Maskey  mentioned it. Paragraph 14.10 of the Patten report states:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The model we have developed would lead to the  proportion of Catholic officers more than doubling within four years, to  between 17 and 19 &hellip; and quadrupling within ten years to 29-33&rdquo;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The text that has not been quoted from that  paragraph reads:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;We believe that this is a very substantial increase  within a reasonable timeframe &hellip; It quickly gets into the range of &lsquo;critical  mass&rsquo; estimates that experts have given us (between 15 and 30), as the level  needed to ensure that a minority does not find itself submerged within a  majority organizational culture.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Will the Member give way again?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I am sorry, but I have already given way, and I am quoting from the Patten  report on this point.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We are at the top end of that range. The figures that I  have before me show that we are at 27&middot;88%, as of February this year, and the  projections are that we will hit the Patten targets. We have now reached a  stage of maturity, and we can make the point that all are welcome to join the  police on the basis of merit.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Will the Member give way once more?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I am sorry, Mr Maginness. I have already given way and will not do so again.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will address amendment No 2. It may come as a surprise to  Mr Farry that the Ulster Unionist Party will support the amendment. Mr Farry  said to the SDLP that Mr Ford does not like to be called sectarian just because  he is a unionist. The Ulster Unionist Party does not support the amendment  without good reason. We are determined to be a non-sectarian party that is open  to all the people. We are pro-Union and pro-devolution. That is the way forward  and that is why we will support the amendment. However, if the sauce is good  enough for the gander, it is good enough for the goose.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I return to the SDLP&rsquo;s point. I do not understand why that  party is fixated on the past and on going backwards, and on dragging us into  debates that are unproductive. Mr Attwood talked about the positive things that  we have all done, yet he then dragged us back and said that we cannot be relied  on to act in a positive manner.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We should fix on the strategic review of policing&rsquo;s  revelation that there are 704 fewer front line police officers than there were  three years ago and that, since the Patten recommendations were implemented,  the experience base has diminished by 73%. There are now 3,904 officers in the  PSNI who served in the RUC and 3,358 who have been recruited since the  establishment of the PSNI. The impact of that is that we no longer have the  experience that we need to deal with serious crime.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Look at the terrorist attacks that we have had recently &mdash;  we do not have that resource there either. It is not about a sectarian  headcount; it is about selecting good officers on merit who give us the police  service that we need.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should draw his remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  The fundamental challenge for all of us is to get a police service that all the  people of Northern Ireland  can support. That is the only way to a sustainable long-term future, and that  is why we support amendment No 2.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  I support the motion. I welcome the fact that the discriminatory policy is, at  long last, coming to an end. It has been our party&rsquo;s position that the policy  of 50:50 recruitment in the PSNI should be brought to an end. To go further, it  should never have been introduced in the first place. It is discriminatory to  select people on the basis of whether they are Catholic, Protestant or other. I  know of many people, some of whom were in the Reserve forces, who have applied  once, twice, three times and even four times to join the Police Service in  recent years and have been turned down because they were Protestants. That is  absolutely outrageous.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The argument for the policy was to increase the number of  Catholic police officers in the PSNI. One has to ask what religion has to do  with the Police Service of Northern Ireland. Even the Member opposite referred  to merit in his closing remarks. Unfortunately, he added a comment about 50:50  recruitment, so although he went halfway to declaring that recruitment should  be based on merit, he put in the caveat that it should be merit that was based  on 50:50 recruitment. It should be on merit alone, not on any other basis. The  policy demonstrates that the SDLP and Sinn F&eacute;in are not interested in human  rights or equality. They speak so much and so loudly about equality, but this  policy flies in the face of that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I noted that my party colleague Gregory Campbell, at the  introduction of the debate, referred to Alex Attwood and the statistics that  show the under-representation of Protestants in the Housing Executive. Another  example is the Equality Commission, in which there is a stark contrast between  the representation of Protestants and Catholics. If Alex Attwood or any other  SDLP Member wishes to put forward a motion to introduce fairness and equality  to the Protestant community in either of those two sectors, I would happily  sign it. That would be very fitting, given that the SDLP Minister holds the  portfolio of Social Development, which is responsible for the Housing  Executive. If any SDLP member wishes to come to me in the near future, I would  certainly sign that piece of paper with open hands to bring that discrimination  to an end.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In no other western country would a policy of 50:50 be  allowed to operate. Quite frankly, it flies in the face of basic human rights  and equality of opportunity. I pay tribute to the members of the RUC, the UDR,  the Special Constabulary and the Royal Irish Regiment for their commitment,  dedication and honour in serving Ulster during the darkest days,  which were known as the Troubles. I pay tribute to those who paid the ultimate  sacrifice and lost their lives at the hands of terrorists. Those people did not  join those forces because of Catholics or Protestants; they joined those forces  to serve everyone in Northern    Ireland. I commend the motion to the House.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat. &Eacute;ir&iacute;m chun taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt do leas&uacute; uimhir a  haon.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I support amendment No 1. Policing in the North has been  transformed in the 10 years since the Patten report was published. As my  colleague Alex Maskey stated, Patten did not go far enough on a range of  issues, including 50:50 recruitment. However, we concluded that if the Patten  proposals were implemented, they could provide the threshold for a new policing  service.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">To republicans and nationalists, policing was once the  armed wing of unionism. It was used as a tool to abuse and repress. In my  constituency, I remember the cases of Sammy Devenny and many others. However,  in the years following the Good Friday Agreement and the Patten reform, through  legislative changes that were secured by Sinn F&eacute;in and others, democratic  control and accountability were forced onto policing structures here. Those  structures have been transformed. Republicans are now at the heart of policing,  ensuring that the PSNI is held to democratic account while these institutions  prepare to take full account of policing and justice powers for the first time  in almost four decades.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">5.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Patten has contributed to creating that new atmosphere. As  has been mentioned, when the provision was introduced in 2001, Catholics made  up just 8&middot;3% of the police. Today, as has been said, it stands at almost 28%,  which is still well short of being truly representative of the community as a  whole. However, it is progress in the right direction, and I would have hoped  that the Members who tabled the motion would have welcomed that. After all,  what is so threatening about having a police service that is representative of  the community that it serves?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Gregory Campbell and others have consistently railed  against the Patten reforms. Gregory Campbell is one of those who have been  telling the world for years that everything would be OK if Catholics accepted  the forces of law and order. I believe that Gregory Campbell wants Catholics to  be policed, but in my opinion, he does not want them to be in the police.  However, just like your Parliament, the days of a Protestant force for a  Protestant people are long gone.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The 50:50 recruitment policy is not about discrimination  against Protestants or about giving Catholics an unfair advantage; it is simply  about recruiting on a representative basis. Regardless of whether it is applied  to police officers or to civilian staff, recruitment must be carried out in a  way that reflects the community as a whole. A good police service should be  representative of the community that it serves, and we are now on track to  achieve that through 50:50 recruitment. Therefore, I welcome the retention of  that provision for another year. I hope, as the amendment states, that the  policy continues after the percentage of members from a Catholic community  background in the Police Service reaches 30%. That continuation will help to  bring about a closer resemblance to the community as a whole.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The experience of policing has shown us that special  measures are absolutely necessary to bring the number of Catholics in the PSNI  up to the level that it should be. Such measures should remain an option in the  years ahead until we reach the stage at which the PSNI is truly representative  at all levels.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: The  Member puts great store by her belief that processes should be put in place and  maintained to ensure that the Police Service fully reflects society. Why, then,  has her party not tabled an amendment requiring similar percentage quotas on  the grounds of gender or for ethnic minorities, for example? Surely if the  police are to be fully representative of all sections of society, her party  would be similarly exercised about putting in place legal quotas that reflect  all elements of society, rather than about having quotas that are based simply  on a sectarian headcount.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  We are similarly exercised about those issues, but we are dealing with the fact  that one community used to police another. One community used to impose policy  on another. Thankfully, those days are gone, and measures such as 50:50  recruitment should remain an option in the years ahead until we reach the stage  at which the PSNI is truly representative at all levels. The fact remains that  there continues to be a serious under-representation of Catholic officers in  senior ranks, as many Members here who are on the Policing Board know. Indeed,  I declare an interest as a member of the Policing Board.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, as we continue to build a new era of human  rights-based policing here, with justice responsibilities being transferred out  of Britain into the hands of people here in Ireland, I urge the proposers of  the motion and the amendments to stop re-fighting the old lost battles over and  over again. They should join with the rest of us in building the kind of  representative, accountable policing service that people voted for and want to  see. I support amendment No 1. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>: I  am pleased to speak in the debate, and I declare an interest as a member of the  Policing Board and as Chairperson of the Assembly and Executive Review  Committee. I support the motion.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It must be said that since 2001, the Police Service of  Northern Ireland has undergone unprecedented change, as has the entire British  police service. Indeed, that change continues. The PSNI is now one of the most  accountable police services in Europe, and,  possibly, in the world.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Some figures have been cited, one of which was that 27% of  the PSNI&rsquo;s membership is now Catholic. It has also been said that the 50:50  policy has been extended for another year to allow that proportion to hit the  30% target.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Patten report has been quoted many times today, but  here is a new quote:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The percentage of Catholic applicants rose from 12 to  21 after the IRA ceasefire in 1994, and fell back when the ceasefire ended. It  rose again in 1998 to 20.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is why, over the years, there has been an  imbalance. Even Patten accepted that fact, and nobody can rubbish it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I spent 30 years in the Police Service. I see some SDLP  Members smiling, but I challenge any Member, or anybody outside the House, to  say that, throughout my service, I did not serve the whole community  impartially.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Does the Member accept that in some people&rsquo;s experiences in places such as  Carrickmore, County   Tyrone, where the RUC&rsquo;s  behaviour towards the local population was often disgraceful, the RUC presented  itself as a sectarian force? Notwithstanding the Member&rsquo;s commitment, does he  accept that that was the case?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>:  On many occasions over many years, it was RUC officers investigating themselves  who brought to justice members who had done wrong. I could quote many instances  in which that was the case, so do not give me any lectures.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My son, who is now a police officer in another part of the United Kingdom,  has first-hand experience of 50:50 recruitment. On two occasions, I saw the  devastation on that young man&rsquo;s face. He twice passed the first part of the  PSNI&rsquo;s recruitment process, which is much more robust than other police  recruitment processes in the United    Kingdom, and on both occasions, he was  elated to receive a letter to say that he had passed. Within a week to 10 days,  there was absolute devastation when the &ldquo;sorry you&rsquo;re a Prod&rdquo; letter arrived on  the doorstep. That scenario was repeated in many homes. Whether people like  that or not, it is wrong.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>: I  have already given way.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There has been much talk about police services in the rest  of the United Kingdom,  and Alex Maskey spoke about community policing. Throughout the United Kingdom, many cities are as divided as Northern Ireland,  and people from ethnic backgrounds do not apply to join those police services.  All parts of the Catholic community must encourage Catholics to join the  police. Everyone should have equal opportunities and be recruited on merit, and  the best people for the job must apply.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Basil McCrea referred to the future, and he mentioned a  figure of 100 recruits in the nine to 10 years after 2011. As the chair of the  Policing Board&rsquo;s human resources committee, I know from Police Service figures  that only 40 or 50 new recruits will be required to replace those who will leave  the Police Service because they are at pension age, resigning or being  dismissed. The recruitment process should be based on merit, and the best  person should get the job, irrespective of religion.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Police Service of Northern Ireland is no different from  any other British police service or, if people want to talk about them, from  the guards. Policing and community policing is about providing a service to the  community, irrespective of a person&rsquo;s religion, ethnic background or anything  else. That is what the public deserve and should have, so let us get away from  tarnishing the police as a Protestant police force for a Protestant people, an  expression that Alasdair McDonnell used only last week when, in an open forum  at Wellington College, he deliberately misinterpreted  figures.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should draw his remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>:  That was wrong, and it needs to stop.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: I  also wish to place on record my membership of the Northern Ireland Policing  Board.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the debate today and would have welcomed it last  week as well. The Ulster Unionist Party has always believed that the 50:50  recruitment policy initiated by Patten was the repugnant legalisation of  religious discrimination. I welcome the end of a policy that has placed Northern Ireland outside the norm of equality  legislation in the UK and  across Europe.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Any reasons that people may have had for supporting 50:50  recruitment in the past have surely disappeared by now. We should not ignore  the fact that having put recruits through a discriminatory process, we ask them  to swear an oath upholding equality and fundamental human rights.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Let it not be forgotten that Sinn F&eacute;in and the SDLP support  the Police Service in Northern    Ireland. It is good that both parties sit on  the Policing Board, which scrutinises the Police Service, and on the district  policing partnerships, which help to set priorities for local community  policing. Other Members touched on the fact that we probably have the most  regulated police service in the Western World.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In light of those facts, the SDLP amendment is deeply  regrettable and, in truth, in stark contradiction to the principles on which I  thought that party was based. The equality in which I believe means that people  are judged on their talents and abilities, not on their status at birth or  their religion or ethnicity. I want a Northern Ireland that promotes that  type of equality.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is no doubt that Northern Ireland has changed for  the better. I genuinely want the Police Service to reflect the entire  community. That means that the Police Service must be made up of Protestants,  Roman Catholics and anyone else who wants to join. However, promoting  discrimination to achieve that goal is simply wrong. Whether people are  appointed to the Police Service must be based on merit alone. Some Members  implied that police officers are there to represent their section of the  community. That is also wrong and should not be accepted by any right-thinking  person. Everybody in this place has a clear responsibility to encourage  Protestants, Roman Catholics and any other religious or ethnic group to join  the police and to serve all the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionist Party condemns the cowardly attacks by  dissident republicans on Catholic officers in the PSNI, and I am pleased that  the attacks have not reduced the number of Catholics applying to serve in Northern Ireland.  However, if we are genuine about creating a new and sustainable dispensation in  Northern Ireland,  everyone must be treated equally. The SDLP should now do the right thing by  respecting the decision to end 50:50 recruitment and working towards a  genuinely equal Police Service.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The 50:50 recruitment policy meant that one section of the  community lost confidence in the police. The SDLP has shown today that it does  not trust the structures of which it is part, and it does not trust the brave  policemen and policewomen in Northern    Ireland to serve the entire community. That  is deeply regrettable.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If Northern    Ireland is to have a more positive future,  we must promote genuine equality of opportunity for all. We will have to build  a Northern Ireland  that is based on trust. Earlier, Mr Attwood referred to the fact, as he saw it,  that Protestants had not been unduly affected by the 50:50 recruitment policy.  However, since the introduction of the policy, 945 Protestants and no Roman  Catholics have been rejected. That discrepancy speaks for itself. The decision  to end the deeply flawed policy of 50:50 recruitment will help to boost confidence  again. Therefore, everyone should welcome it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionist Party had suggested a similar amendment  to that of the Alliance Party, but, unfortunately, it was not accepted for  debate today. As a result, I am happy to support the motion as altered by  amendment No 2.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">5.30 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I am pleased to participate in the debate. I am amused by the unionists&rsquo;  argument that they are opposed to positive discrimination because, as is the  case with the Alliance Party, they do not present any alternative argument on  how to achieve a police service that is representative of the whole community.  That is the basic weakness of their argument. If 50:50 recruitment did not  exist, Catholics would not have such significant representation in the Police  Service.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way, unlike his colleague Alex Attwood who  refused to do so earlier. Alban Maginness has made that same point several  times. Does he accept that 40% of those applying to the police, currently and  in previous competitions, are Catholic? That, in and of itself, will eventually  resolve the under-representation of Catholics in the Police Service. However  long that might take, it will be resolved more quickly than the under-representation  of Protestants in the Housing Executive.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I accept that there is a variety of figures.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We want a steady stream of people from the Catholic  community to join the Police Service to make it representative of the whole  community. As members of the Police Service, we want them to represent the  whole community, not only the Catholic community or the Protestant community.  That is the important objective, and it is one that we should all want. When  people signed up to the Patten report, they agreed, as stated in chapter 14,  that the community would be fully represented in the Police Service.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Simpson</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  No; my time is running out.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If Members want to consider the arguments, paragraph 14.11  of chapter 14 of the report states:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;We have not taken our model beyond 10 years. As we  have said in the previous chapter, we would expect the question of the size of  the police service to be revisited by that time. In the light of recruitment  experience and other developments between now and then, a judgment would need  to be made as to whether special measures were still needed to achieve a police  service representative of the community or whether this could now be expected  to develop naturally. Either way we envisage that the composition of the police  should continue to move towards a closer resemblance to that of the community  as a whole.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is what Patten said, and people signed up to  that worthy objective.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We have almost achieved 30% Catholic representation, and  that is good for all of us. That figure of 30% represents the critical mass to  which the Patten report refers. However, there is a fundamental difference  between establishing a critical mass and achieving representativeness of a  community in the Police Service.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It also amuses me that the unionist parties forget that, in  1922, Sir Dawson Bates recommended that one third of RUC recruits be taken from  the Catholic community. That was an attempt to make the Police Service  representative of the whole community. In case some Members think that Sir  Dawson Bates was a softie, he was far from it. As the Minister of Home Affairs  for several years, he was responsible for gerrymandering and, amongst other  things, the abolition of proportional representation. From a unionist point of  view, his political credentials were sound, and his view should be instructive to  all unionist Members. Such a recruitment policy is a proper means by which to  try to establish a community balance in the Police Service.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">More work remains to be done to make the Police Service of  Northern Ireland fully representative. Contrary to what the Alliance Party  said, it cannot be achieved on a laissez-faire basis. If we were to rely on  what the Alliance Party said, we would be stuck with the percentage of Catholic  representation in the Police Service at around the mid-teens. That level would  not have been exceeded, the percentage would not be close to the critical mass  of 30%, and the Police Service would not be approaching the point at which it  could be deemed as representative of the whole community. That is an important  achievement.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The people who have been appointed, whether from the  Protestant community or the Catholic community, are meritorious. Everyone  should remember that. The merit pool is important.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should bring his remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Shame on anyone who suggests that police officers, whether Catholic or  Protestant, are unmeritorious and unworthy of membership of the Police Service.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I declare an interest as a member of  the Policing Board.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I support amendment No 1. The Chief Constable&rsquo;s annual  report for 2008-09 stated:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The PSNI wants to have a workforce that is reflective  of the society it serves.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It went on to say:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;It is through initiatives such as &hellip; the 50/50  legislation that the PSNI hopes to establish a truly reflective workforce.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That makes it clear that the top-ranking police  officers in the PSNI recognise that there is a compositional problem and see  the benefits of implementing a 50:50 recruitment policy or something similar  until the workforce is more representative than it is now.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s party is fond of talking about equality, but there does not seem  to be equality for Protestants joining the PSNI. Does his party believe that  recruitment to the PSNI should be based on the best man or woman for the job  and not on his or her religion?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member has an extra minute in which to speak.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: As  was made clear in previous contributions, a merit pool exists, and everyone who  gets a job in the PSNI through the 50:50 recruitment system is appointed on  merit.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, it is clear that top-ranking police officers  recognise that there is a compositional problem that must be dealt with. The  PSNI top team, which includes the Chief Constable, faces a challenge to bring  forward proposals to ensure that compositional change continues if Patten is  phased out. If they do not, and the percentage of Catholic employees and  employees from other minorities in the Police Service decreases, confidence in  the police will suffer a massive blow.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We must, of course, address the representation of other  minorities and other sections of our society. Stephen Farry referred to those  from working-class communities. There is an under-representation as far as the  loyalist and republican communities are concerned.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Simpson</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: I  will not.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Peter Weir  referred to under-representation in gender and race. The Policing Board has  tried to address that through a gender action plan. Sinn F&eacute;in has submitted  proposals to look at measures that other police services have implemented where  the representation of females in the police is monitored.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">At a time when we should be maximising confidence through  the devolution of policing and justice powers, there is a danger that that  confidence could be eroded from within.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: I  will not give way.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Patten report said:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;real community policing is impossible if the  composition of the police service bears little relationship to the composition  of the community as a whole.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That point was also made in the Macpherson report,  which, following the death of Stephen Lawrence, highlighted the racism in the  Metropolitan Police Service in London.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Patten did not place a cap on the 50:50 recruitment  programme when Catholic composition reached 30%; the NIO and the British  Government did that. Patten forecast that the programme could achieve as much  as 33% Catholic representation in the Police Service after 10 years and said  that the composition of the police should continue to move towards a closer resemblance  to that of the community as a whole.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Other opportunities have been missed. Alex Maskey referred  to the recruitment of part-time officers, which could have been handled better.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is an onus on the board and, indeed, on the PSNI to  look into the number of new recruits who leave the service and to interpret the  reasons for their leaving. Three hundred and thirty officers who joined the  PSNI since November 2001 have left, 209 of whom had Catholic backgrounds.  Therefore, Catholics are significantly more likely to leave the police.  Clearly, that area requires more scrutiny. Not enough exit interviews are being  carried out with those leaving the Police Service.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Aside from the 50:50 issue, it was envisaged that the  accommodation of lateral entry would help to deal with the more severe under-representation  of Catholics at the higher levels of the service. Unfortunately, that has not  come to pass, and the British and Irish Governments have not shown the  political will necessary to deal with the barriers being faced by garda&iacute; who  want to join the PSNI by way of lateral entry. Given the proposed phasing out  of 50:50 recruitment, the two Governments must urgently put in place a plan to  deal with the issue of pensions for those seeking to transfer using that  mechanism. With the forthcoming promotions in the police, the importance of the  lateral entry mechanism cannot be underestimated.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The changes to the Police Service and to policing over the  past 10 years have been positive, but it is important for that process of  change to continue. Community representation is intertwined with community  confidence and real community policing. A lot of work has been done, but a lot  more needs to be done.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr W McCrea</strong>:  The debate is timely, and I congratulate my colleagues on bringing it to the  House. We have had a decade of discrimination against the Protestant community,  and it is sad that that is to be extended for a further year. However, it will  be welcomed if it is the final year.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Significant numbers of Protestants across the community have  been deliberately discriminated against because of the action taken to kowtow  to the republican agenda and to nationalist agitation. Today&rsquo;s debate has been  very interesting. I never cease to be amazed by the arrogance of some people,  which verges on hypocrisy. On the one hand, they are against discrimination and  are for fairness and equality legislation. However, when it comes to  Protestants, it really does not matter: that can all be thrown out the window.  In his remarks, Mr Alban Maginness said that it amuses him. I can tell Mr  Maginness that there is nothing amusing about discrimination when one is being  discriminated against. I realise that that fact might amuse him, but many of  the young people who have applied to join the Police Service of Northern Ireland  want to serve their community.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I pay tribute to those who served the community in the RUC,  the RUC Reserve and the RUC GC. They served the community during some of the  most difficult years that Northern    Ireland has been through. I pay tribute to  those young men and women from both the Protestant community and the Roman  Catholic community who stood side by side against a vicious onslaught of  terrorism, and did so courageously. I congratulate all those in the community  who decided to make their contribution to the well-being of Northern Ireland, not because of their religious  name or tag, but because they wanted to serve the people and to bring peace and  stability to Northern    Ireland. Therefore, the Protestant community  resents the fact that when applicants go through all the examinations and  health checks and are acknowledged to be suitable candidates to serve the  community, they are told that the only reason that they are being turned down  is that they happen to be Protestant.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">When Mr Maginness made his comments, he was challenged by  my friend from East Londonderry Gregory Campbell about equality of  representation for Protestants in the Housing Executive. He never took it under  his notice. He had nothing to say. He was totally silent, and the record of the  House will prove his silence. He was silent because he does not really care  about the Protestant community. He does not care about it being discriminated  against in the Housing Executive, and he does not care about it being  discriminated against in the Health Service. He just does not care, simply  because fairness and equality mean nothing when a person happens to be a Prod.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Just as those people do not want to see a Prod on the  streets or walking the roads, so they do not care whether they have a job. I do  not care about a person&rsquo;s religion. If a person is a Roman Catholic, that  person has the right to a job, and he or she has the right to have opportunities  equal to those of their fellow citizens in this country. It is not a person&rsquo;s  religion that should decide whether they get a job; whether they are best  person for that job should decide.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">5.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Many years ago, before I was the chairperson of Magherafelt  District Council, a charge was made against the SDLP that when it was in  control of that council, it had discriminated against the Roman Catholic  community. It is on record that the only time that the Roman Catholic community  got fairness of employment in that council was during the four years that  unionists controlled it. Indeed, I was the chairman of the council during that  time. Therefore, I will not stand for lectures from anyone on the issue of  fairness.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I believe that the best person for the job should be the  one who gets it, irrespective of their religious persuasion. That person would  deserve the job, regardless of whether the post is in the police, the Housing  Executive or in any other body in society. That is why I give my wholehearted  support to the colleagues of mine who tabled the motion. A discrimination  exists that must be condemned and ended now. I ask the House to give its  resounding support to the motion.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should draw his remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr W McCrea</strong>:  Let us see Northern Ireland  moving forward to brighter and better days in which we can cast aside  discrimination against both the Protestant community and the community at  large.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  A viable principle in any democracy ought to be that religious discrimination  is wrong &mdash; period. The British Government have had to create a derogation from  law, and they have had to abuse natural justice and create a false situation in  which that principle has been violated and in which active discrimination has  an impact day and daily.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier in the debate, Jimmy Spratt gave a very moving  account of what happened in his own house. Indeed, that account could be  repeated 1,000 times across the homes of Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  Let me make my point.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A person could have applied for a job in the Police  Service, could have passed all the tests, may have gone through vetting and had  everything approved, yet a letter could land on their doormat telling them that  because they are a Protestant, they will not be getting in. That is an  indictment of a democratic society, and it tells a story of discrimination that  the House should be united in opposing. It is discrimination, regardless of  whether it is against Roman Catholics or Protestants, and it happens because of  the place in which the people concerned choose to worship or because an  accident of birth means that they have ticked a particular box on a form. The  House should stand in unity against such discrimination. Instead, however, we  have Members trying to contrive clever little arguments that justify  discrimination. Discrimination cannot be justified; it is wrong. The House  should stand united against it, and it is a sad reflection of our society that  it has not.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The House has heard a great deal from the SDLP about the  Patten report and about how it should be protected, how it is a totem about  which everything is right and how we should never move away from it. However,  the SDLP was quite content to move away from the Patten report when it demanded  2,500 part-time officers in the Police Service. I have yet to hear that party  demand that that element of the Patten report be implemented. I have also yet  to hear the SDLP argue decisively that the Patten report should be implemented  for building a police college in Northern Ireland, and I have yet to  hear that party oppose the extension of the contracts of the full-time Reserve  for four years, even though Patten suggested that it should be made extinct by  April 2006.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  I will give way in a moment.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Although the SDLP keeps clinging to the point that the  Patten report is invaluable and must be protected, the fact is that that party  is cherry-picking because it likes discrimination against Protestants. That is  the bottom line.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. Returning to an earlier point, will the  Member tell the House what he would say to a meritorious Catholic applicant who  received a refusal because they did not fit the 50:50 recruitment policy? The  whole emphasis of the debate is on the Protestants who did not get the jobs.  What about the Catholic applicants?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member has an extra minute in which to speak.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  I thought that my earlier comments would have sufficed. All discrimination is  wrong, and the only people who should receive letters of refusal are those who  have not been meritoriously successful and who have been advised to try again.  That refusal should not be based on their religion. However, it is unfortunate  that such discrimination happens. The fact of the matter is that discrimination  fosters more discrimination and more hurt.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Some points were made earlier in the debate about how some  want to see more discrimination &mdash; indeed, some want discrimination extended for  another 30 years. I hope that the House says that enough is enough, that  discrimination will not be extended for another 30 years, and 50:50 recruitment  will not be used for the recruitment of civilians or anyone else. We should end  the evil of discrimination.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is an issue about the number of Roman Catholic  recruits who have left the Police Service. The Member for North   Antrim said that 209 Roman Catholics who had been probationer  constables and then constables had subsequently left the service. That happens  twice as often among Roman Catholic recruits as it does among Protestant  recruits. However, we should look at the reasons why some of those people are  dismissed. According to the sheet of paper that the Member quoted from &mdash;  selectively &mdash; 80 student officers resigned and 36 were dismissed. Forty-one  probationer constables were dismissed, seven constables were dismissed, and 51  resigned because they did not like the job. One sergeant resigned because he  did not like the job.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Those people leave the service for a whole host of reasons.  Most of them do so voluntarily because they do not like the service. One has to  accept that, when, for so many years, members of a community were deliberately  targeted and murdered if they joined the police, and the so-called democrats of  that community did not encourage their community to join the police, and would  not even join the Police Authority, it is little wonder that Roman Catholics  did not feel comfortable about joining. When they do join and discover that it  is not the job that they actually wanted, they have to face up to the  consequences of that, and it is better for them to get out. The fact is that  those 209 vacancies could have been filled by people who should have been meritoriously  recruited to them. That is the indictment of the House, and I hope that we  right that great wrong.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: I  fear, when I listen to the arguments for discrimination from the Benches  opposite, that Members are defending their mistakes almost as if they were  defending their inheritance. When the history of 50:50 recruitment is written,  it will be shown to be the antithesis of fairness and equality.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have four points to make, and I would like, if I may, to  use the acronym SDLP. The &ldquo;S&rdquo; stands for &ldquo;sectarian&rdquo;. We have already heard  today the attempted identification of Mr Ford as a unionist &mdash; a clear example  of sectarianism creeping into the SDLP. The &ldquo;D&rdquo; stands for discrimination. We  in Northern Ireland have had  to go to Europe to say that we wish to depart  from the acceptable standards of fairness and equality. The Benches opposite  want to go against standard practice on human rights. They want to derogate  from human rights in order to get the discrimination in the SDLP against  Protestant people who apply for jobs on merit.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As for labour relations, when I think of the SDLP and look  at the little bunch of green capitalists in front of me, I see a party as far  removed from that of Fitt and Devlin as it is possible to be. Is the 50:50  recruitment policy not the opposite of labour relations? We will bring people  in, set them a test, offer them a position on merit, but at the end of that  process, the SDLP will tell them that it will discriminate against them and  derogate from internationally accepted human rights principles in order to do  it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague Ian Paisley Jnr referred to the picking in the  SDLP. We have had the sectarianism, the discrimination, the opposite of labour  relations, and then we have the picking of the parts of the Patten reforms that  they like and the parts that they do not like. Is it coincidence that the parts  that they do not like are the parts that particularly affect the Protestant  community? I will mention a case from my Strangford constituency, although I  will not mention the person&rsquo;s name.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A young man got his job through merit and served for a  number of years in the Metropolitan Police in London,  where he gained a plethora of experience in a modern UK city. In Strangford, we want  people to come to live, invest and work in the area. That young man came from a  United Kingdom  police force with a proven track record of excellence and expertise, and he  applied to join the PSNI. Having got all the way through the system, he was  told that although he was qualified and had a proven track record and  references in policing, he would be discriminated against in Northern Ireland  because he is a Protestant.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">How can I go back to that person and say that I want him to  live and work in Strangford and raise his family and invest there, when he will  be discriminated against because he is a Protestant? Is that not the worst form  of discrimination imaginable? Is that not discrimination with a capital &ldquo;D&rdquo;?  How can we ever turn that around?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In the future, people will ask us questions. They will ask  why we derogated from human rights by discriminating against Protestants. It  will be asked why many people who could have served the Police Service very  well are not going to be given that opportunity. I join Dr McCrea in paying  tribute to the men and women of the police, the RUC Reserve and the RUC George  Cross, who served the public when the SDLP ran away. They continued to provide  a service when they were being terrorised in and outside of work and when  off-duty disabled police officers were shot. Is it not the ultimate in heroism  that they continued to serve while the SDLP ran away?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am sad that only two Ulster Unionist Party Members are  present for a debate on a matter of such magnitude. It gives me no pleasure to  say that the principle of 50:50 recruitment originated in the mind of Ken  Maginnis.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The business on the Order Paper has not been disposed of by 6.00  pm. In accordance with Standing Order 10(3), I propose to allow the business to  continue until 7.00 pm or until business has been completed.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I support the original motion. As will most Members, I can well remember the  day when the saying &ldquo;may the best man win&rdquo; was applicable for all competitions  and for all job applications. The person who performed best and who was the  best skilled would win the gold medal or get the job. Clearly, that has not  been the case in PSNI recruitment since the Patten recommendations for a 50:50  policy came into play. It is no longer the case that the best, most skilled or  most fit-for-purpose man or woman will get the job; it is the one who ticks the  right background boxes.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The best way of illustrating the issue is to give an  example without mentioning any names, as other Members have done. Recently, I  was contacted by a young man who went through the rigorous selection process on  three occasions. On each occasion, he scored well, but, unfortunately, he did  not come from the right background. I long for the day when that young man will  phone me to say that he has been accepted to join the PSNI and can make a  contribution to society, as many such young people can.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will give an example from my constituency of Strangford,  which Jonathan Bell also represents. Members will remember a song that used to  be on TV called &lsquo;Two Little Boys&rsquo; by Rolf Harris, and they will be glad to hear  that I am not going to sing it. The song is about two young boys who grew up  together and ended up on the battlefield. One was a Union soldier and the other  was a Confederate soldier.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am very annoyed by the SDLP amendment, because I know of  two young boys from the same district who ran about together. If they were  standing in front of us, you could not tell the difference in where they came  from, because they both looked the same. They were the same age when they  applied to join the police, and they were friends. They both made it through  the application process as far as the medical and the role play. One got  through to the next stage but, unfortunately, the other one did not.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The one who got in was a Roman Catholic. I know the  young man, and I am sure that he will make a superb police officer and will do  extremely well. However, he got a lower score in the role play than the  Protestant applicant, yet the SDLP says that the system is meritorious and  honest and not discriminatory and biased against Protestants. The fact is that  it is dishonest, and so is the SDLP&rsquo;s amendment. I am very annoyed about that,  but I will have to deal with it.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">6.00 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The number of people from a Catholic background who have  applied to the Police Service has risen. In fact, the figures quoted today show  that 28&middot;7% of police officers are Roman Catholic. Times are changing, and we  should support the principle of people getting jobs based on their merit,  experience and ability rather than on which church they attend on Sundays.  Minister Goggins has stated that the 50:50 process will be run for the last  time this year. Many people in the Province breathed a sigh of relief when they  heard that, and they are pleased that that will be the case. A discriminatory  process is in place that is grossly unfair to Protestant people, and that is  quite annoying.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  Does the Member accept that it costs &pound;61,022&middot;95 to recruit a single police  officer and that the reason that it costs so much &mdash; it is about &pound;30,000 more  than the rest of the UK &mdash; is the discrimination clause? Earlier, we heard that  209 Roman Catholic officers have left the service, which means that in excess  of &pound;12 million of resources has been wasted over the past couple of years  because of that recruitment clause. That is a disaster financially, socially  and for community relations.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member has an extra minute in which to speak.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I thank the Member for his comments, and I agree with him wholeheartedly. His  point clearly illustrates the issue. The monetary factor must also be taken  into consideration.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I work closely with community groups in my constituency of  Strangford, and I can assure Members that the only questions that those groups  ask about police offers are whether they are willing to get their hands dirty,  muck in with everyone else and do the job. They do not ask what their religion  is. They do not want to know which box those police officers mark on election  day; rather, they want to know whether they will go the extra mile when  necessary. They do not want an officer who fits the right profile; rather, they  want an officer who can profile and catch the thieves who are terrorising their  areas. That is an issue for the many people whom I represent. They want police  officers who are called to the job as their vocation and who are sensitive to  the needs of the community in which they serve. That is not found in a person&rsquo;s  religion but in the quality of his or her character.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP wants the best for all people, so, regardless of  religion, why accept less than the best that we can have? I am happy to support  the motion because I know that, in doing so, I am supporting the end of  discrimination and a new era for PSNI officers of all religions who are not  there to fill a quota but are there to do the job to the best standard that can  be achieved. That young Protestant from my area who did not get into the Police  Service because he attends the wrong church on a Sunday must be given the  chance to do a good job.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  First, I express my sincere thanks to all past and present members of the  Police Service in Northern    Ireland and their families. They have done a  sterling job over many years, often in very difficult circumstances. I salute  them and thank them for their service to the entire community. I pay tribute to  all those from both communities in Northern Ireland who are in the  security forces, some of whom made the supreme sacrifice.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members have cried discrimination at every possible  opportunity over many years. Today, they will try to justify discrimination in  the form of 50:50 recruitment to the Police Service. That shows how determined  they are to ensure that the unionist population loses out in the process of  selecting police officers. However, discrimination is discrimination no matter  how one tries to justify it. They use the phrase &ldquo;positive discrimination&rdquo; only  as a PR stunt to spin their hypocrisy when it comes to equality for every  member of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  population.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Recent press coverage said that 1,000 applicants to the  Police Service who were perceived to be from the unionist community and were  suitably qualified to begin training were unable to be offered a position  because they were not from the nationalist community. Is that the equal society  that Members want to build? That is not my vision for the future. I want to see  police officers on the street who gained their position on merit and not  because of their perceived religious background.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Another aspect of this twisted process is the future  strength of the Police Service. Will it be adequately manned? If candidates  from the nationalist community were required to fill 500 vacancies but only 200  applied, the perception is that the 200 applicants would get positions and the  Police Service would only be able recruit another 200 officers in order to  fulfil the requirements of the 50:50 policy. What would happen to the other 100  positions? They would remain unfilled. That could ultimately lead to an  undermanned police service, stretched to the limit and providing a poorer  service. That would not serve the people of Northern Ireland well, regardless  of political or religious background.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As the motion states, all of us can look forward to a new  beginning for recruitment to the Police Service that is based on the merit of  candidates and not on perceived religious affiliations. For the first time in a  decade, employment opportunities will be based on equality.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Simpson</strong>:  We have listened to comments from Members on the opposite side of the House  about more Catholics joining the police force. However, in Craigavon on  Saturday night, the co-religionists of those Members attacked young police  officers and attempted to take their lives. Does the Member agree that in the  long term that could have a detrimental effect on young Catholics joining the  police force?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  I agree entirely with my colleague&rsquo;s sentiments.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Candidates must fit the physical and educational criteria  laid down for entrance to the police, instead of being turned down because of  their perceived religious affiliation. I congratulate my colleagues on securing  the debate and take great pleasure in supporting the motion.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  The debate has been fairly restrained and largely constructive, compared with  what it could have been. The issue of 50:50 recruitment is clearly divisive,  and there is a significant sense of grievance on a number of sides of the  House.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Our amendment seeks to find the broadest basis possible for  agreement and unity in the House. The two nationalist parties have a  diametrically opposed viewpoint, but hopefully our amendment provides the basis  around which a number of parties can unite. What we are trying to do is  straightforward: primarily, we are trying to welcome the forthcoming end of the  50:50 recruitment policy. The stated opposition in the Assembly to the use of  quotas is clear. The important step forward of ensuring that recruitment is  based solely on merit is central to what we are trying to achieve.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We welcome the support from the Ulster Unionist Benches.  Although parties in here may have differences on a range of issues, my party  always judges issues on the words on paper and on what people are saying. Basil  McCrea is not here, but I have no doubt that he does the same.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I urge the DUP to consider supporting our amendment. I  identify with the sense of grievance that DUP Members have expressed today, and  the points raised with them as elected representatives are no different to  those that I and many other Members hear. However, it is important that we move  the issue away from being a grievance for the Protestant section of society,  although I recognise that people from that background are affected by 50:50  recruitment more than anyone else. Looking to the future, it is important that  we frame the issue as something that works against the interests of society as  a whole and recognise that people, whether they are of Protestant, Catholic or  ethnic minority background, have a different sense of identity in society. The  debate is an opportunity to look to the future and to say that the issue is not  about one section of society versus another but about the important principle  of merit and ensuring that all police officers in Northern Ireland are treated as an  individuals and are judged solely on the skills that they bring to the table.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Leslie Cree and Alban Maginness outlined the essence of the  shared and common vision that we are seeking to achieve in Northern Ireland,  which is, essentially, that every professional police officer, irrespective of  his or her background, should and will be capable of delivering the same fair  and impartial service to all sections of the community without any issues of  religion. We can all unite around that idea and around the merit principle as  the important bases on which to recruit. The merit pool is not the only issue.  We must also consider how candidates are ranked, because people feel a sense of  grievance when someone who scored lower than them is recruited ahead of them.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Other issues about quotas have been raised. We made the  point that quotas can be counter&shy;productive and that they are sometimes too  simplistic to capture the real diversity in our society, particularly among people  from a working-class background. Daith&iacute; McKay echoed that sentiment. Moreover,  we need to consider the issue of retention. During the debate, Members made a  challenge and asked what the alternative is. I sincerely believe that quotas  are not necessary to achieve a representative police service. Members can quote  statistics from the past number of years, but the political process has been up  and down.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If we, as a society, send out a united message that we  respect police officers and support recruitment on merit without  discrimination, we can encourage applicants to come from all sections of  society in proportion to their distribution across society. Over time &mdash;  quickly, I hope &mdash; we will create a truly representative police service, and the  sense of grievance will be absent from society. I urge all Members to unite  around the Alliance Party amendment, which represents the best and most  positive way to send a clear signal of what people want to achieve.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Many comments have been batted back and forth about the SDLP, and some Members  have tried to be amusing in their insults. The SDLP is prepared to take that on  the chin. Members have talked about standing up for equality and fairness.  Members opposite and many Members across the Chamber seem to have forgotten why  the fair employment legislation was introduced in Northern Ireland, why the Equality  Commission still exists and why we need a bill of rights: it is because there  was so much discrimination in the past. We all agree that a police service is  one of the central pillars of any democracy.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  I am delighted that the Member has brought the Fair Employment Commission into  the debate. She must know that, historically, the largest claim that was ever  taken and fought by the Fair Employment Commission was on behalf of a  Protestant who had been discriminated against. That case demonstrated the high  levels of discrimination against Protestants.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Member recognise and accept that the Irish state  in the Republic   of Ireland is only now  coming to terms with the history of the Royal Irish Constabulary? When will the  SDLP come to terms with and accept the history of the Royal Ulster  Constabulary, instead of denigrating it?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I will deal with the Member&rsquo;s points. My party has always been on record as  saying that many good men and women in the RUC stood against terrorism in the  past. However, as events and reports have shown, some members of the RUC  colluded with loyalist paramilitaries in their attack against the Catholic  community. That is a matter of record; it has been evidenced and researched. In  fact, people &mdash; not nearly enough of them &mdash; have been brought to court and to  justice over that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member mentioned standing up for discrimination against  Protestants. As a member of Craigavon Borough Council, I and other members of  my party are the only representatives who have gone to the Equality Commission  on four occasions because of that council&rsquo;s unfair treatment of Protestants in  Craigavon. I await the outcome of those tribunals with interest.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">6.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  No; I have already given way, and I have very little time to deal with the  matter.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that, as a result of this debate and the debate on  the bill of rights, Sinn F&eacute;in Members will think again before they go through  the Lobbies to support a Justice Minister from the Alliance Party. That party&rsquo;s  Members skulked out of the Chamber before the main Question was put on the bill  of rights motion, and they cannot even agree on the 50:50 recruitment policy.  The Alliance Party is in denial about what happened in the past on policing,  and it should reflect, as a party, on whether it should continue its collusion  with the unionist parties on the gerrymandering of the Justice Minister post.  Time and time again, the Alliance Party has kowtowed to the DUP on all those  matters of importance to the whole community.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A number of issues were raised in the debate. Mr Attwood  began by saying clearly that our party is on record as supporting and  acknowledging the bravery and the leadership shown by the young men and women  who apply to join the PSNI. Indeed, by the time Sinn F&eacute;in decided to join the  Policing Board, 87% of the Patten recommendations had been either wholly or  partly acted on, endorsed or implemented.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Paisley Jnr threw out a few red herrings, which he knows  to be entirely disingenuous, about the SDLP&rsquo;s support for policing. Our party &mdash;  Alex Attwood in particular &mdash; has on many occasions led the campaign for funding  for a new police college. We have supported the opening-up of the debate on the  part-time PSNI Reserve, but we have failed, as Alex Maskey rightly pointed out,  to deliver on community policing in the way in which Patten envisaged and our  communities hoped for.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Simpson was right when he said that those who attacked  the police at the weekend are making it more difficult to implement the  outstanding Patten recommendations on police community support officers,  community policing and the defortification of our police stations. Those people  are acting against the wishes of the community &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to bring her remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  &mdash; and they are acting against Patten.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Do I have an extra minute, Mr Deputy Speaker?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: You do have an extra minute, Mrs Kelly. That was my mistake.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am sure that Members will be  delighted to hear that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to deal with any misunderstandings that exist about  the merit pool. In response to a question for written answer that Lord Laird  asked in the House of Lords, Baroness Royall of Blaisdon said:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The 50:50 recruitment procedures are only applicable  to those applicants in the merit pool, by which time they have demonstrated  that they meet the required UK  standards.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Therefore, all applicants are in the merit pool.  George Robinson raised the &ldquo;What if?&rdquo; scenario &mdash; if not enough Catholics apply  in a particular funding round, no one will get a job. That has not happened,  nor is it likely to happen.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member must bring her remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  The figures show that applications from both communities continue to rise,  despite the background of increased violence.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: At  the end of what has been a passionate but well-mannered debate, I support the  motion that my colleague Gregory Campbell moved. I declare an interest as a  member of the Northern Ireland Policing Board.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I think that it was Ian Paisley Jnr who said that the  motion was about righting wrongs. Some of the older Members in the Chamber will  recall that, after the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, one of the  unionist slogans used at the next Westminster election was &ldquo;To Put Right a  Great Wrong&rdquo;. That is what the House should do, in order to send out a clear  signal. Ian Paisley Jnr said that religious discrimination is never right,  whether it is directed at Protestants or Catholics. The Assembly should take a  firm stance and decide that those who seek employment in the police or in any  other profession should be employed purely on merit. That should be a strict  principle. The SDLP and Sinn F&eacute;in have preached at us and lectured us ad  nauseam on equality, but unfortunately I am not surprised to say that today we have  seen that they are doing the opposite. They do not practise what they preach.  The opportunity to stand four-square behind the merit principle seems to have  been rejected by two of the parties opposite.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In moving the motion, Gregory Campbell highlighted the fact  that there have been in the region of 40,000 applications to join the police  force in past years. This is not some mere theoretical debate; it is something  that impacts on many people&rsquo;s lives. Reference was made later in the debate to  the fact that around 1,000 applicants from the Protestant community had been  rejected solely on the basis of community background, and no applications from  the Catholic community have been rejected.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As Mr Campbell indicated, the principal reason that there  were so few Catholics in the old RUC was the campaign by the Provisional IRA.  Whether it was the direct violence of the IRA or the shunning of the police by  the SDLP, which failed to take its place on the Police Authority for much of  the Troubles, it is no wonder that the figures were so low at that stage. We  have also seen that, whenever the threat of violence has been largely removed  following the ceasefires &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  will give way briefly.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  The highest level of Catholics in the RUC was around 11%. That was during  peaceful times.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Why?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  You may ask why. The figure was 11% not because of any IRA campaign. It was  11%, and the historical and political reasons are there if you care to look at  them.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: The  historical reasons are that, just as the SDLP&rsquo;s fingerprints are all over  trying to keep people out of the police, its predecessors in the Nationalist  Party and other nationalist parties urged people not to be members of the  police force for years. It was not just the terrorism of the party opposite but  the constitutional blocking of parties such as the SDLP and the old Nationalist  Party. The guilt lies at the door of the SDLP as well.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The evidence of the extent to which the situation was based  on violence was that even in the first year of the ceasefire we saw the number  of people from the Catholic community applying to join the police force almost  double. It has been indicated that, had there not been a 50:50 recruitment  campaign over the past years, nearly 40% of applicants would have come from the  Catholic community. Therefore, there was no need for it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The double standards of the parties opposite on  discrimination were highlighted by the proposer and a number of other Members.  Whether it is the Housing Executive or the Equality Commission, where there is  a disproportionate number of Catholics in any section of the workforce, there  is silence. There is no advocacy of 50:50 recruitment in those cases. The Civil  Service, for example, has a disproportionate number of Catholics at the lower  levels. Has a quota system been offered or suggested by any of the parties  opposite? No, it has not. [Interruption.]</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. I ask Members to make all comments through the Chair and  not from a sedentary position.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: No,  I only have a few minutes.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Attwood started off with a fine contribution, praising  the work of unionists on the Policing Board, and then, like one of the skiers  in the winter Olympics, he went downhill rapidly soon afterwards. He said that,  although there were many fine people in the RUC, they were seen as an arm of  the state. He went on to suggest that special measures should be carried on for  20 or 30 years in the police force as a whole and, perhaps, for 60 or 70 years  when it came to civilian recruitment for the PSNI. Although I welcome the  concession that the Member made, he clearly sees partition carrying on into the  long-term future to advocate those sorts of measures. I reject the level of  discrimination that he sees as being in place.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Farry&rsquo;s measured contribution indicated that the Alliance Party, to its  credit, has been consistently opposed to 50:50 recruitment, and he said that it  was unnecessary, divisive and of questionable legality. We have some reservations  about the Alliance Party&rsquo;s amendment because it avoids direct reference to the  community that has been most discriminated against. However, in a spirit of  cross-community consensus, Mr Farry&rsquo;s remarks have persuaded us to support his  amendment. He is right that, although the discrimination inherent in 50:50  recruitment has been against the Protestant community, there has also been a  negative impact on members of the Roman Catholic community and other  communities who have sought to join the police.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Catholic officers who joined the police in recent years  have the stigma of not necessarily getting their place completely on merit.  When we move to recruitment on merit next year, for which this party argued &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Will the Member give way? His remarks are grossly insulting.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  will not give way; I have only another two and a half minutes.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. It is clear that the Member does not want to give way.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  am afraid that some of the Members opposite will have to be insulted from a  sedentary position.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Is it in order for a Member to suggest  that a member of the PSNI is &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.] </span>I am  making a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. The Member is making a point of order.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  Is it in order for a Member &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Mr Attwood has the Floor.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  To which Standing Order does the point of order refer?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I will make that judgement.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  Is it in order for a Member of the House to suggest that any person in public  employment in the North, including members of the PSNI, is employed on grounds  other than merit? Everyone, including the Chief Constable, confirms that every  member of the PSNI has been recruited on merit. Is it in order for a Member to  suggest otherwise?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. The point has been made, but it is not a point of order.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr W McCrea</strong>:  Is it right for a Member to abuse the systems of the House? The Member knows  that that is not a point of order.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Unfortunately, we have had many spurious contributions.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  will return briefly to the debate. Several Sinn F&eacute;in Members, including Alex  Maskey, tried to compete with the SDLP by making out that they were not just  pro-Patten but pro-Patten-plus. They claimed that that the evil hand of the  Government was behind all forms of discrimination.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Trevor Clarke, Jim Shannon, Jonathan Bell, Jimmy Spratt and  others gave personal examples of people who applied to the Police Service but  were turned down. We must remember that a range of human stories and lost  opportunities lie behind the figures. Mr Clarke even held out the hand of  friendship to Mr Attwood and suggested that, if equality was really what that  Member seeks, he will be willing to support a motion on that basis. Double  standards have been demonstrated by the Members opposite. As many Members  asked, if they are so wrapped up in the idea that the Police Service must be  completely representative of society, why are there no special quotas for  women, ethnic minorities and every other kind of minority? The desire for 50:50  recruitment is driven by one motivation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As William McCrea said, the DUP was never in favour of  50:50 recruitment, but we welcome the fact that this is its final year. We look  forward to a situation in which all police officers can provide the required  service on the basis of merit. That will also &mdash; I pick up Ian Paisley Jnr&rsquo;s  point &mdash; lead to recruitment that is more cost-effective than the somewhat  constrained current approach. Resources can be taken from the false position of  50:50 recruitment and put towards front line policing and dealing with crime. Officers  will be able to deal with crime, having been appointed on merit.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to draw his remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  That is what society wants. I support the motion and the Alliance Party&rsquo;s  amendment.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">6.30 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Before I put the Question on amendment No 1, I advise Members that if the  amendment is made, amendment No 2 will not be called. If that is the outcome, I  will proceed to put the Question on the motion as amended.</p>
