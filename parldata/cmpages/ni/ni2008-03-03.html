	        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 12.00 noon (Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr  McClarty] in the Chair).</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="1"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">February Monitoring Outcome</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I have received notice from <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">the  Minister of Finance and Personnel that he wishes to </span>make a statement on  the February monitoring outcome.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr P <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">Robinson)</span></strong>: With permission, I wish to make a statement  about the Executive&rsquo;s decisions on the February monitoring round. This is the fourth and final monitoring round  of the 2007-08 financial year, and Members will b<span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">e aware that the role and purpose of the in-year proce</span>ss <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">is to help the Executive to make the most of the  re</span>sources at their disposal. At the Executive&rsquo;s meeting on 28 February  2008, they decided on some reallocations of expenditure for the short time  remaining in the current financial year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is also important to note that this monitoring round  follows the departmental spring Supplementary Estimates, which were debated in  the Assembly on 12 February 2008. Departments are constrained by the spring  Supplementary Estimates and associated Budget Bill position, because no  allocation can be made in the February monitoring round above the position for  which legislative authority has been sought. The first stage in each monitoring  round is the identification by Departments  of resources allocated in previous Budget processes that, for a variety  of reasons, will not be spent in this financial year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In overview terms, reduced requirements declared by  Departments in this monitoring round amount to &pound;51&middot;7 million in respect of current expenditure and &pound;61&middot;7  million in respect of capital investment. The level of reduced requirements  declared in this round is much greater than the levels that were identified at  the corresponding time in previous years. That continues the trend from the  previous monitoring round, with the result that the amount declared for this financial  year is some 41% greater than the reduced requirements that were declared last  year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although I commended Departments for the significant level  of reduced requirements identified as part of the December monitoring round,  the context for the February monitoring  round is quite different, because there is significantly less scope to  utilise the resources that become available in the February round than in  earlier ones. I, therefore, urge Departments to redouble their efforts, as we  move into the 2008-09 financial year, to  declare reduced requirements as early as possible in the year so that  the opportunity to redeploy funds into priority areas is not missed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Statutory Committees will have a key role to play by  regularly monitoring the financial performance of their respective Departments  and identifying, as early as possible in  each year, those areas where less spending  is expected to take place than had been planned for.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise that a primary focus of Departments is to spend as much of the moneys that have been allocated  in the Budget process as possible at the first stage in order to deliver the  associated improvements in public services. However, where that is not  possible, there is an equal responsibility to ensure that any resources not  needed by a particular business area can be redeployed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although there is an issue that significant levels of reduced requirements reflect poor planning at the  Budget stage, it is much better that  Departments and Committees identify reduced requirements earlier rather  than later in the financial year or, indeed, allow them to fall as end-of-year  underspend. Details of all the reduced requirements declared by Departments are  set out in table 1 of my statement, which  is available to Members.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The largest reduced  requirement in current expenditure &mdash;  &pound;8&middot;7 million &mdash; has been declared by the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  (DHSSPS), following on from the delay in the decision on the review of public administration (RPA). The  Department for Social Development (DSD) has declared a &pound;22 million  reduced requirement in capital expenditure from additional land sales, and the  Department for Regional Development (DRD) has identified a &pound;10 million slippage  in the funding required to Northern Ireland Water for this financial year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The December monitoring round concluded with some &pound;57  million unallocated capital resources, which included anticipated access to our  end-year flexibility stock in the 2007-08 block. In the context of such  significant sums being available for allocation, but with no corresponding  pressures expected, a prudent approach was adopted to minimise underspend and  hence facilitate future discussions with the Treasury regarding access to  end-year flexibility stock.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Overall, therefore, &pound;69 million was available for  allocation in this monitoring round for capital expenditure, and &pound;39 million  could reasonably have been allocated for resource spend. Against that level of  resources available for allocation, Departments have submitted current expenditure  bids in the amount of &pound;1&middot;6 million and capital investment bids amounting to  &pound;63&middot;4 million.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Turning first to the position as regards current  expenditure, in light of the late stage of the financial year, only two bids  were put forward, both by the Department of  Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL). The Executive have agreed that &pound;0&middot;9  million should be allocated for the purchase of additional book stock to assist  library boards in meeting published targets, and a further &pound;0&middot;7 million has  been allocated to provide for the  winding-up of the Northern Ireland Events Company.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to capital investment, the Executive have  agreed to allocate &pound;58&middot;9 million to Departments. That includes &pound;6&middot;9 million to  the Department for Regional Development to meet a pressure resulting from delay  in planned receipts from asset sales as well as  additional cost from a change in accounting treatment for insurance costs associated with the first  design, build, finance and operate (DBFO) roads capital programme.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The most significant capital pressure, however, has arisen  with respect to DSD because of lower than expected capital receipts from house  sales as a result of the more constrained credit environment, and the sale of  land at Ballee in Ballymena is not now expected to be finalised until 2008-09.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although DSD has taken measures to ameliorate the revenue shortfall, the Executive have agreed to  meet the net capital pressure of &pound;52  million. That follows on from the &pound;50 million allocated in the December  monitoring round to the Department for Social Development for a <span style="letter-spacing:-.3pt; ">range of social housing initiatives, including  co-ownership</span>; the warm homes scheme; and the social housing development  programme.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The consequence of the  level of reduced requirements and bids met is that for current expenditure,  the level of planned overcommitment is now &pound;13&middot;3 million. This is significantly  below our target of &pound;50 million at the conclusion of the February monitoring  round and highlights once again the need for Departments to declare all reduced  requirements as early in the year as possible. In terms of capital investment,  we now have unallocated resources of some &pound;10 million. However, all underspend  resource will continue to be available to be  carried forward for use by the Executive in the future.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Looking forward, 2008-09 will be the first time in a stable  political environment that Northern Ireland Departments will be implementing  the spending plans that have been developed  by local politicians as opposed to direct rule Ministers. Although the  main indicator of success will be improved services, a key milestone will be  that resources are used for the purpose intended and in the timescales  envisaged.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I recognise the progress that has been made during 2007-08 to improve financial  management and hence ensure a more  effective allocation of resources. This work will need to accelerate  next year in light of the more challenging fiscal environment faced by the  Northern Ireland Executive.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I commend the February monitoring position to the Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel (Mr Storey)</strong>: I thank  the Minister for his statement to the House. The Minister plans to reduce  overcommitment, year on year, over the Budget period to &pound;100 million in  2008-09; to &pound;80 million in 2009-2010; and to &pound;60 million by 2010-11. The high  levels of reduced requirements declared by the Departments at this stage have  been managed by overcommitment provision. Will the Minister comment on how  underspend will be managed in the future if this pattern of returning resources  late in the financial year continues, especially given the plan to reduce  overcommitment?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition to the important role of each Assembly  Statutory Committee in scrutinising its Department&rsquo;s monitoring round returns,  to improve the accuracy and effectiveness  of financial forecasting processes, is there also a need for the Department of Finance and Personnel (DFP) to  challenge Departments more robustly on the reasons  for return of resources and on the timing of those returns? Also, in a  statement on the June monitoring round with regard to underspend, the Minister  stated that the optimum would be to reduce  current underspends close to 1%. Given that today&rsquo;s statement marks the  last monitoring round of the financial year, will the Minister comment further  on the way forward to reduce current resource and capital underspend?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I thank the Deputy Chairman of the Committee for his questions. I wish that it  were possible to give clear answers to them all.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Storey is right to say that there is a pattern:  Departments are leaving their underspend declarations to late &mdash; almost too late  &mdash; in the year. Unfortunately, that is where the patterns seem to end. As I  indicated in my statement, the amount of underspend this year is significantly  greater than it was in previous years. One can only judge the future by the  past and present, and therefore DFP, in looking at the degree of overcom&shy;mitment,  looks at it in terms of what has been the previous  pattern. That puts the Department in a difficult position if the pattern  changes, because it has set the amount of overcommitment to eat up in the  various monitoring rounds on the basis of previous patterns. If this year&rsquo;s  pattern were to be followed in future years, there might in the June monitoring  round be more of an effort to spend some of  the additional funds than was the  case in June of this year, when we committed nothing.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We need to watch the patterns very carefully. The Deputy  Chairperson is right to say that there is a role for all the Committees &mdash; not  just the Finance and Personnel Committee, although it has the key role &mdash; in  monitoring the spend of their Departments to ensure that money is spent on time  for the purposes that have been set out, and that any likely underspend is  declared as early as possible. In that way, we can make the best use of our  funds and have them reallocated for the proper purpose.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Is the Minister aware that the Housing Executive has, for a number of weeks,  been suspending repairs until the new financial year? Will he tell us whether  this monitoring outcome can be used to ensure that Housing Executive tenants  have their repairs carried out, especially new-tenant repairs, without which  people cannot move into houses?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  The Member will know from my statement that we met all the bids that were made.  If there had been an additional bid from the Housing Executive, it would have  been looked at very seriously. The difficulty that the Housing Executive &mdash; and  the Minister for Social Development &mdash; will have is that there is a very short  period in which to spend this money. That is why it is important that  underspending be identified earlier, so that programmes can be put in place,  whether it be planned maintenance or whatever else. The only caveat that has to  be entered at this stage is whether the Housing Executive could have spent the  money, had it been allocated as a result of today&rsquo;s monitoring round. With only  a month left to spend the money, it is too late in the year. Also, the Assembly  has already accepted the spring Supplementary Estimates.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that, in an ideal world, there would not be  under-expenditure on the part of Departments? Regrettably, that has happened.  Given this continuing issue, there may be a need to review the amount of  funding that is held back for over-expenditure, so that we can be certain that  the money that is allocated to Northern    Ireland is put to good use here.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am particularly interested in funding for children and young  people. Why was &pound;3&middot;8 million returned unspent at this late stage?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  Unfortunately, we do not live in an ideal world. No matter how well a  Department might plan for the incoming year, there will always be legal issues,  planning issues or other regulatory issues that will mean that plans do not go  forward as quickly as expected. There will be pressures on Departments from  various areas for more funding. One can never contem&shy;plate, a year &mdash; or, in  many cases, three years &mdash; out, exactly how each Department will spend money.  There will always be a level of underspend.  What is important is that we have the best management systems, in order  to identify as early as possible what underspend there is, so that we can reallocate the funds to priority purposes. I  suspect that there is not one Government Department that, if notified back in  June that funds were going to be available, could not have identified some  worthy purpose, whether it be children and young people or some other issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The money, however, is not lost. While it does go back, on  paper at least, to the Treasury, we can, of course, negotiate with the Treasury  in order to get access to it. I will be doing that. As far as this CSR period  is concerned, we successfully negotiated to have  all the end-year flexibility stock that is available to the Executive  allocated within those three years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I assume that I will have to go back to the Treasury at the  end of the financial year to argue for the inclusion  of the money that will be underspent this year.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. I welcome the fact that any money not  spent during this financial year will be carried forward for use by the  Executive. I welcome also the allocation of new money to the Department for  Social Development, given that the Ballee land sale is not expected to go ahead  during this financial year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As has been said, these are large releases of money at this  time of the year, and that is to be regretted. The low level of bids,  particularly on the resource side, indicates that Departments were not  confident that they could spend the money during this financial year, and I  welcome the indication that steps are being taken to improve the management of that aspect. What confidence can the  Minister give us that receiving Departments will be able to spend the money  during this financial year? It will not look well for the Assembly, after a  Budget round in which there was a great deal of clamour for money and public  concern in certain areas, if we declare a significant underspend at the end of  the financial year. That will create a situation that the public will not  understand.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  The Member makes the point well. It is not just the public who will not  understand that situation; I am the one who has sore ribs and a sore arm,  having had it twisted up my back over the past few months by Ministers. They  told me that they did not have half enough money in their budgets and that they  needed more, and then I find that that they are handing money back to me during  two monitoring rounds. It may be a bit difficult to understand, but,  ultimately, it is down to financial management.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is essential that the Committees play a significant  role: we did not have the benefit of them during the direct rule period. We are  developing a template for Committees to enable them to examine departmental  spending throughout the year, so that it is not left until the tail end of the  year to find out that money that could have been used in a Department is not  going to be used. The Committee for Finance and Personnel is co-ordinating that  work.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We will be in complete control of our Budget during the  incoming financial year, having set it ourselves and having the opportunity to  implement it ourselves, and we want to  improve on the current end-year underspend.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As regards the contemplated asset sale at Ballee, in many  ways, we could welcome that situation because if the sale had gone ahead, it would have left more end-year  flexibility to be dealt with. The present situation means that the money is  likely to be available during the next financial  year. Therefore, we will have to look carefully, with the Department, to  see where to make the best use of those additional resources.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  return to the subject of patterns that was raised by Mr Storey. What  investigation is the Minister carrying out into the pattern of some Departments  re<span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt; ">gularly declaring large underspends and  others regula</span>rly receiving additional moneys from those underspends? What consideration is he giving to ensuring that  services could be funded in a more strategic way rather than their  living, essentially, on scraps from someone else&rsquo;s table? I have in mind the  current situation in which quite a lot of Northern Ireland appears to be  coned off due to roadworks. The public&rsquo;s perception is that Roads Service is  not only spending its own money but that of  other Departments by carrying out roadworks at the end of each financial  year.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I do not agree that &pound;50-odd million could be  said to be scraps. If we had a lot of such &ldquo;scraps&rdquo; we could do quite well. The Committee for Finance  and Personnel will want to work with  all the other Committees to ensure that underspends are identified as  early as possible. I do not believe that Departments wilfully allow money to be underspent at the end of the  financial year; I believe that they  are over-optimistic about being able to spend the money and, therefore,  do not want to return it to the centre in case another Department gets hold of  it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, from where I sit, looking across all the  Departments, I would clearly rather that another Department used the funds than  send them back to HM Treasury. That would mean that we would have to fight to  get the money in a future financial year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some Departments find it  much easier to spend money quickly. DHSSPS and DRD are two such  Departments. For example, money can be spent on road maintenance in a  relatively short time &mdash; that is probably why the Member has encountered some  difficulties when driving around Northern Irelan<span style="letter-spacing:0pt; ">d</span>.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, I would not like to see what our end-year  underspend would be if we did not have our present monitoring round mechanisms,  particularly given our Health Service and health boards and the activities of  DRD and its Roads Service. We should use funding wherever we can, and Northern  Ireland plc would benefit from any improvements in those Departments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We will be interested to see what will happen as a result  of the new treatment that is being granted to the Department of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety. That will be very much a learning curve for all of  us, given that that Department will be able to use and identify its own  underspend earlier without fear of having to return the funds to the centre.  Consequently, those funds can be used for other purposes, either because of  pressures in other areas or, indeed, because the Department wants to develop  new programmes. It will be interesting to see how that works over the year;  indeed, it may provide a model that we can adopt in other areas.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: How  will the special dispensation that has been afforded to the Department of  Health affect next year&rsquo;s monitoring process?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  Where the Health Service is concerned, the first point is that half of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  Budget will not be part of the monitoring process. Obviously, monitoring will  continue, but the benefits or losses in the Department of Health that might  result from underspend or additional pressures will be borne by that  Department. As I said to the Member&rsquo;s North Down colleague, it is an interesting  experiment, and it will be worthwhile examining its results. The Department  need not be concerned that some other Department will walk off with any of its  early declared underspend; it will be able to use those funds for its own  pressures or to develop new programmes. That  is a massive gain for the Department, and it will be interesting to see  how that experiment works out through the year.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I am like other Members in that,  when I hear of an underspend of so many millions of pounds, I wonder what is wrong with the system. I was  heartened to hear some Members who know more about finance than me say  that they did not understand the process. I was also heartened to hear the  Minister of Finance and Personnel agree with Mr O&rsquo;Loan that it is difficult to  understand.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Given that Office of the First Minister and deputy First  Minister (OFMDFM) has set tackling poverty as a priority, is there any  opportunity for the Executive to earmark any of the underspend &mdash; which goes  across several Departments &mdash; in order that  poverty specifically can be tackled? Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  The money is at the disposal of the Executive until the end of the financial  year, when it goes back to the Treasury and  we have to bid for it again.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I share the Member&rsquo;s view: when faced with constituents proposing various community schemes  that require Government funding, I  find it difficult to explain the situation. Through Departments, the  Government will indicate to those people that they do not have the resources in  this financial year to assist the proposed schemes. However, those people will  then read in their newspapers or see on television that there is a massive  underspend in the very Department from which they were seeking funding. In  those circumstances, it is difficult to  explain to people why their proposed scheme has not been given the  go-ahead.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Departments have a massive fear of overspending, but I  criticise them if they underspend, as do the general public. However, so far as  the Treasury is concerned, overspending is the unpardonable sin: the wrath of  the Treasury will be poured on Departments if they overspend. Therefore, there  is always an attempt to err towards underspend than overspend, but that should  be confined to much smaller amounts than is currently the case, and I believe  that underspend to that extent comes down to poor financial management.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If underspend were identified at an earlier stage,  programmes such as those that the Member mentioned could have been funded at  that early stage. However, now that the spring Supplementary Estimates have  been dealt with and there is only one month left in the financial year, it will  be difficult for Departments to spend in that constrained time frame.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. I note that, at this late stage in the  financial year, there is a significant number of reduced requirements, and  Departments will have grave difficulty in spending the results of that in the  available time limit. I also note that that difficulty is much greater than it  has been in the corresponding period of  previous years. What action will the Minister take to ensure that future  reduced requirements are declared much earlier in the year?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  Committees will have a key role in ensuring that that happens. As I understand  it, my officials are already working with the Committee for Finance and  Personnel to develop a template that will allow  each Committee to track how resources are working through the system.  The Committees will be able not only to do that, but they will be able to  question their Minister and departmental officials as to why spending is falling  behind. In areas for which there has been no expenditure, each Minister and his  or her officials must give commitments that the moneys will be used within the  required time frame. The present financial year began under direct rule, with  the result that Committees have not yet had that essential role to play.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure (Mr McElduff)</strong>: Go raibh  maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. First, I note with considerable interest  the &pound;1&middot;6 million &mdash; which is essentially for two projects &mdash; that has been  allocated to the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure. Will the Minister  tell the House whether the &pound;0&middot;9 million that has been allocated for the  purchase of additional books to assist the education and library boards is a  recognition that, with the establishment of the single library authority, not  enough money has been made available for books and for the delivery of  front-line services? The Committee is hearing that message from all the  education and library boards, and I hope that the Minister can confirm that  there is an acceptance in the Executive that that has been the case.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, following on from Claire McGill&rsquo;s question, is  the Minister concerned about the so-called culture of underspend in Departments?  If so, what is he doing to turn that around?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  The Executive have met the only two bids that were made for resource  expenditure, both of which came from DCAL. My understanding is that the amount  that was allocated to DCAL enables it to meet its book stock targets. As  Chairperson of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure, the Member will  have considerable influence on future targets. However, that allocation has  meant that the current target has now been met.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I repeat: a process is being established to allow the Member and his Committee &mdash; and all other  Committee members &mdash; to have a greater role in keeping their Departments  to account and to ensure that they are meeting the spending targets that were  allocated in the Budget. Departments fought for more money, they helped their Ministers to get the funds that are  available to them, and now it is their duty to make sure that their  Ministers spend the money within the set time frame.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I, too, thank the Minister for his statement. Several Members  have mentioned the significant sums of money that various Departments are  handing back. What actions will the Minister take to ensure that, in future  years, there is access to the 2007-08 underspend funds?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  The process is not automatic. The Treasury  recognises and identifies a stock of end-year flexibility, and, in order to receive the underspend for a given  financial year, the case must be argued with the Chief Secretary to the Treasury. However, such end-year flexibility  stocks are counted as ours.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We reached agreement with the Treasury concerning the significant underspends that had built up;  those funds will be allocated over the three years of the compre&shy;hensive  spending review. Therefore, all underspend that has been identified to date has  been allocated to the next three financial years. In addition, this financial  year&rsquo;s underspend will be added to our end-year  flexibility stock, and I will have to negotiate separately its  allocation over following years.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Will the Minister confirm that  discussions concerning the purchase of the former Forkhill military base are  ongoing with Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) officials,  and that no final decision has been taken? Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  Sufficient underspend funding was available to have covered what the Minister  sought for the Forkhill site. However, before reaching that stage, a business  case must be submitted and approved by Department of Finance and Personnel  officials. That is a highly technical  matter &mdash; I have not the slightest idea about how the figures are  produced. However, I have met the Minister  of Agriculture and Rural Development, who has been informed about the  business plan&rsquo;s failings, particularly about how costs might be reduced by  additional funding from other sources and/or by reducing the amount of bells  and whistles on the proposal. My officials will consider any resubmitted  proposal. Of course, should a business plan be approved, funding is available  for the Department.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  Will the Minister provide an assessment of this financial year&rsquo;s underspend?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s question invites me to put my head on the block. I can tell him  what the Departments have told me the year-end underspends will be, although,  in the past, those Departments gave me figures that would not have led to the  underspend available for this monitoring round. Therefore, I emphasise caution.  However, the figures indicate that there will be &pound;104 million in current  expenditure and &pound;49 million in capital expenditure. Both figures are  considerably less than those for the previous year; however, I will wait until the end of the financial year to ascertain whether the Departments meet the figures  that have been submitted. In addition, Committees should question their  Departments about likely underspends for this financial year in order that, at  the end of the year, they can compare those with the targets set.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeaCheann Comhairle. If I may have the liberty to raise  a couple of issues, I would first like to  further explore the matter raised by my colleague from West Belfast Mr  McCann. The Housing Executive has apparently  run out of money for remedial work. The Minister did give a full answer,  but I would like to know whether, in the  past two monit&shy;oring rounds, the Minister for Social Development told  the Finance Minister that the Housing Executive was in danger of running out of  money for repairs. Housing Executive houses  are sitting empty because the Housing Executive does not have enough  money to repair them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, what measures will the Department of Finance  put in place to ensure that the public purse will get value for money from the  land sale at Ballee, Ballymena?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  Very often, I get criticised for control freakery and micromanaging  Departments; yet there are times when people ask why I allow a Department to do  one thing, when it should be doing something else. We cannot have it both ways.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On the Housing Executive issue, all I can tell the Member  is that, as he knows, every bid received from the Department for Social  Development in relation to that matter has been met. If further moneys are  required, it is up to DSD, in its discussions with the Housing Executive, to  make a bid for those. I cannot second-guess what the discussions were in the  Department. Those questions are more appropriately asked of the DSD Minister.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As far as the more  general issue is concerned, I again emphasise that I can allocate  resources to Departments, but it requires them to put in bids. Departments will  put in bids only if they are sure that they can spend that money during the  course of the financial year. Therefore, the earlier that an underspend is  recognised by a Department, the earlier we can reallocate that funding and make  it available for the use of other Departments. I cannot spell it out enough;  early identification is down to the Departments. I cannot do it myself &mdash; it  must be done by the Departments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Ballee land issue is a matter for the Department for  Social Development. The funds will be available in the next financial year.  That gives a longer opportunity for officials to look at how to spend that  money, because it was expected that that money would be available in this  financial year, rather than in the next. I hope that some financial-management  benefits will arise from that.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>:  As a member of the Agriculture Committee, I ask the Minister to explain the  under&shy;spend of 5&middot;9%, which amounts to &pound;13&middot;9 million, and the forecast for  capital investment, which amounts to 25&middot;4%. That is sad news for the  agriculture industry. Will he explain how he arrived at those figures?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I did not arrive at those figures &mdash; they were provided by the Department of  Agri&shy;culture and Rural Development. Throughout the monitoring rounds, we have  been able to meet bids &mdash; with the exception of the Forkhill bid, for the  reasons that I stated earlier. If there are specific issues that the Member  wants to raise about the way that the Department of Agriculture has dealt with  matters, I suggest, as diplomatically as possible, that he raises them with the  Minister for that Department.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="2"></a>Executive Committee Business</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Rates (Regional Rates) Order &nbsp;(Northern Ireland) 2008</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr P Robinson)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly approves the Rates (Regional Rates) Order  (Northern Ireland)  2008.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Order today is not simply about setting the level of  rates for the next financial year; it is about setting a new approach to how we  address financial issues in Northern    Ireland. The days of asking the people of Northern Ireland  to make an ever-increasing financial contribution to efficient public services  are over. Now it is time for Government to deliver.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Rates (Regional  Rates) Order (Northern    Ireland) is a vital part of the  annual financial cycle. The form of devolution that we have in Northern Ireland means that most tax-raising  powers remain with the national Parliament  at Westminster.  Therefore, this Order provides the  Assembly with its only mechanism to raise additional resources to fund  key areas of central expenditure.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">12.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I indicated previously, devolution is about making a  difference to the lives of people in Northern Ireland, and there is no  clearer signal of that than our approach to the regional rate. The days of  increases in the regional rate compounding to 62% over five years are long  gone. Instead, we are steering a new direction for the future, which will  benefit every household and business in Northern Ireland. For the first  time in many years, instead of the householder being asked to bear the burden,  our key focus is to ensure that the public sector delivers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In my speech to the Institute  of Revenues, Rating and Valuation  (IRRV) in Belfast in 2007, I stated that one of  my priorities was to control the level of the regional rate in Northern Ireland.  The Department of Finance and Personnel has  delivered on that commitment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Northern Ireland faces major challenges, none more so than  in our public spending plans, which must reflect reality and the fact that we  will have to manage our finances within a framework that has, at its  foundation, a commitment to delivery, innovation and efficiency.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">During the draft Budget debate, I highlighted that, in the  last three years of direct rule, Northern Ireland had regional rate  increases of 9%, 19% and 6% respectively, with more planned for the years to  come. During the Budget debate on 12  February, I emphasised that a 60% increase in the regional rate over  five years was unacceptable. In that  context, and with the pending introduction of water charges in 2009, I  announced that the domestic regional rate should be frozen for the next three  years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The business regional rate increases have been more modest,  averaging about 3&middot;3% over the past five years. However, businesses will also be  faced with water charges. Therefore, in the draft Budget, I announced an  average increase in those rates of 2&middot;7% a year for the next three years. That  is in line with the expected rate of inflation and, therefore, in real terms,  amounts to a freeze.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That level of regional rate is expected to generate revenue  of &pound;530 million. At the same time, we must continue to consider our methods.  There is a real challenge to address head-on the efficiencies that we need to  make so that more resources can be redirected to the front-line services that  need them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to see how we can achieve even greater efficiencies  beyond the 3% a year targets that have already been set. Members are aware of  how much emphasis I want to be placed on that matter. The new performance and  efficiency delivery unit will be in the front line of the battle to strip out  waste and identify where we can achieve significant savings of public money.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members have argued that, notwithstanding the 60%  increase over the past five years and the introduction of water charges,  householders should contribute even more to public expenditure. I disagree, not  simply as a matter of political philosophy but because of the relatively modest  contribution that such an increase would make to public expenditure.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The regional rate contributes less than 6% of all funding available to the Executive each year.  Therefore, if I had sought a 1% increase in the rate, that would have  raised about &pound;2&middot;7 million of additional revenue. Similarly, some have suggested  that the Department should maintain the domestic rates in real terms. To do  that at the current inflation rate of 2&middot;7% would raise only &pound;5&middot;86 million.  Therefore, generating significant extra revenues through the regional rate  would require increases in rate levels that no one would consider acceptable.  The modest sums that could be raised through rate increases can be compared  with the resources that will be released through efficiency savings made by  Departments. Departments plan to deliver &pound;790 million in efficiency gains by  2010-11.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I now turn to the detail of the Order, and I shall briefly  describe each article.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This short statutory rule specifies the regional rate  poundages for the financial year 2008-09. Article 1 provides the title of the  Order and gives the operational date as the day after it is affirmed by the  Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Article 2 provides for the duration of the Order, and it  will apply until 31 March 2009. Article 3 specifies 29&middot;89 pence in the pound as  the commercial regional rate poundage and 0&middot;3608 pence in the pound as the  domestic regional rate poundage. Today, we are not only setting the rates for Northern Ireland for the next year but, more  fundamentally, charting a new direction for the people of Northern Ireland  with our approach to Government. The Rates (Regional Rates) Order (Northern  Ireland) 2008 not only gives the Northern Ireland householder a well-deserved  break from large increases but it lays out a challenge for Departments to  deliver a more efficient form of Government. I, therefore, commend the Order to  the Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel (Mr Storey)</strong>: I  welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement, and I thank him for his opening remarks. The  purpose of the statutory rule is to fix the amount of the regional rates for  the year ending 31 March 2009. Members will be aware that, as part of the draft  Budget announcement of 25 October 2007, regional rates for domestic properties  were frozen for the next three years, and the rate for non-domestic properties  was increased only in line with inflation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When the Minister announced the draft Budget, he mentioned  that the past three years have seen regional rate increases of 9%, 19% and 6%  respectively, and that the average regional rates bill had increased by 62%  since 2002. The Committee for Finance and Personnel&rsquo;s report on the Executive&rsquo;s  draft Budget welcomed the proposals not to increase the regional domestic rate,  especially given the significant increase in that element of the rates during  the recent period of direct rule. The Committee also acknowledged the proposal  to hold the increase in the non-domestic sector  in line with inflation and, therefore, minimise the burden on business.  That is in line with the Executive&rsquo;s wider priority of promoting economic  growth.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On 6 February, officials from the Department of Finance and  Personnel briefed the Committee on the proposals contained in the statutory  rule. The Com&shy;mittee formally considered the rule at its meeting on 20  February, at which a motion to recommend that the rule be affirmed by the  Assembly was approved by a majority vote. I, therefore, support today&rsquo;s motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  wish to put on record that I am content that the rates should continue at the  levels indicated.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  shall not be as brief as the two Members who spoke before me. The Alliance  Party is opposed to this statutory rule.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  The Alliance Party says no again.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  The Alliance Party says yes to proper public services in Northern Ireland  and to taking a responsible and realistic approach on issues regarding taxation  and expenditure. As the opposition in the Chamber,  it would be easy for the party, on the one hand, to point out all the  deficiencies about public spending and investment in sustainable public  services and rebalancing the economy, and,  on the other hand, simply buy in to decisions being taken on households  and other taxation. However, that would be opportunistic and irresponsible.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party has not provided a fully costed  alternative to the Budget. It does not have access to the resources and the  information to conduct such an exercise. If and when the Alliance Party is in  Govern&shy;ment, it will be up to the party to make its own choices about how it  will balance income and resources. However, party members want to highlight, with  a greater sense of realism, the choices that have to be made and the potential  consequences of the choices that those in Government are making.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to stress two important points. First, the Alliance  Party is opposed to the regional rate. It would replace it with an alternative  measure that is based on ability to pay, such as local income tax. Property  values are not an accurate assessment of ability to pay. We are all aware of  those people who are asset rich and income poor.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, like everyone else, the Alliance Party wants &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  Given that the Member has identified an issue here &mdash; that some people are asset  rich and income poor &mdash; surely that is an even more compelling argument to  support this Order in that it is designed to help people to avoid huge rate  increases?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: If  one is talking about an increase in the rates at the level of inflation, which  is probably the most sensible way forward, then that would amount to 25p to 30p  in the pound per week for the average household.  That is quite a small amount. It is also worth recognising that not  every household in Northern    Ireland pays rates. Therefore, this benefit  from the Executive will assist only some people. The people who do not pay  rates tend to be those who are most dependent on public services, and the  Alliance Party is concerned about the level at which public services have been  funded.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: The  Member has indicated that he is concerned that ratepayers will be paying while  others will not: is he advocating the introduction of the poll tax here?<span class="Italic"> [Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: The Member is well aware of the Alliance Party&rsquo;s proposals in  this regard. My point is that some people will not benefit from what is, in  effect, a cut in the level of the regional rate. However, there are some who very much depend on public services, in  particular the Health Service, and  who will suffer as a consequence of the underfunding of the Health  Service.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Just a moment, Simon. It is important that Members bear what I have said in  mind, not least when MLAs from all parties are commenting on the lack of  funding in the Health Service.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  That was a good lead-in as the Member mentioned lack of funding. Precisely how  much additional investment, on top of the many hundreds of millions of pounds  of additional money that has already been poured in, does the Alliance Party  want to pump into public services?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  have already addressed that point in my opening remarks, and the Member can  look at previous Hansard Reports. It is interesting to note that Members from  all parties are raising concerns about the amount of funding available to the  Health Service. In the North Down constituency, a DUP councillor has been  extremely vocal in pointing out the difficulties that the local health trust is  having in dealing with so-called efficiency savings and is saying that they  amount to cuts. He is calling for additional investment in the Health Service.  Therefore, it is important to recognise that all parties seem to be concerned  with the issue, although some seem to be a bit straighter with the people about  the choices that are being advocated for Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the past, the Alliance Party has criticised rates  increases of between 8% and 19% and has voted against them in this Chamber.  They are a huge burden on people, and we join with the Minister in recognising  that. However, the Minister of Finance and Personnel, along with all his  Executive colleagues and their parties, has now gone to the other extreme, with  a freeze on the regional rate for the next three years. In practice, that  amounts to a cut.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Will the Member not acknowledge that although rating levels are being held for  this year, that reflects the large increases of previous years? Does he not  recognise that huge burdens will be placed on householders in the next two  years with the intro&shy;duction of water rates? Does he want higher household  rates on top of water charging? Does he not recognise that that would be  extremely burdensome and would cause particular hurt to the working poor &mdash;  those who are just above the threshold for receiving rates relief? People who  have to work and have to pay their full rates would accept that continuing to  increase rates will adversely affect the working poor.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: We  are all conscious in this House of the ticking time bomb of water charges &mdash; an  issue which, in many respects, puts this  debate into context. However, there are fundamental reasons why we need  to take a responsible approach to the level of the regional rates. On the one  hand, going for large increases is irrespon&shy;sible; however, at the same time,  going for what is, in effect, a cut is also irresponsible in light of the  pressing need for investment in public services. There is also the issue of the  other financial consequences it will have in our dealings with the Treasury.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">1.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  The Member has given way a number of times, and I appreciate his doing so  again. I am trying to understand his logic. An 8% increase in the rates was  such a huge burden that the Alliance Party, and,  indeed, the then Member for Lagan Valley Seamus Close opposed it vehemently during a previous mandate. However,  Dr Farry is now arguing that a freeze in the rates, which, as he said, would  save about 25p a week, should be opposed. The 8% increase represented a weekly  increase of 75p &mdash; which was a huge burden that the Alliance Party was totally  opposed to &mdash; but a saving of 25p per week is being dismissed. Will the Member  explain the logic of that?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: We  want to avoid a situation in which we are swinging from one extreme to the  other. A planned strategic approach should be taken on issues such as the  regional rate. The regional rate is one element of public service funding in Northern Ireland,  and it is important that it is addressed in a balanced and sustainable manner.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The extremes of having major hikes and unrealistic freezes in the regional rate are unfair and will,  potentially, have to be addressed. Planning for an increase in the  regional rate of around the rate of inflation is the responsible approach and  will fund public services. The people of Northern Ireland are intelligent:  they realise what is happening.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland faces a difficult financial starting  point. Public expenditure here is already heavily skewed because of the  distortions that result from trying to manage a divided society. It is worth  putting on record that the Alliance Party will be meeting the Minister of  Finance and Personnel next week to discuss how the cost of division in Northern Ireland  can be addressed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Unnecessary duplication of services carries opportunity  costs for the possibility of providing quality public services for the whole  community. Sadly, the Executive are not yet prepared to face up to the  challenge of creating a shared future despite the clear social, economic and  financial imperatives for doing so. A shared future is a marginal theme in the  Programme for Government and the Budget.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The British Government have produced a tight comprehensive  spending review (CSR) settlement for Northern   Ireland &mdash; the Barnett formula gradually works against the  interests of Northern    Ireland also. The regional rate is supposed  to reflect the differences between the sources of service delivery in Northern Ireland and Great Britain. In Britain much  more is delivered by local authorities. The regional rate, therefore, is a  vital component in the funding of local services. However, the Minister of  Finance and Personnel and the Executive, through their decisions on tax, have  made a tight financial settlement even tighter. Rather than investing in public  services, or rebalancing the regional economy, they have used available  resources as a tax giveaway.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party has criticised the Budget for its  shortcomings on investment in a number of service areas. Health is the major area  of concern. By 2011, Northern Ireland  will be &pound;200 million behind where it needs to be to keep up with service  provision levels in the rest of the UK.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  is now getting the lion&rsquo;s share of the Budget. Nonetheless, we are flatlining  compared to those in the rest of the UK. People here will pick up on  that point when they see the quality of the health services that are available  to them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have pointed out that the South Eastern Health and Social  Care Trust is wrestling with the need to deliver the so-called efficiency  savings. I am sure that other health trusts are in a similar position. Such  efficiency savings appear awfully like cuts to services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In due course a lot of political parties and Members from  different constituencies will be pointing out the problems in local health  provision and will be making claims for additional resources or the retention  of service levels. When that situation arises, I will say to them that they  have made their beds and must lie in them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party has also highlighted mental-health  provision. In Northern    Ireland only 8% of the overall health budget  is spent on mental-health provision. In the rest of the UK the figure  is 12%. Everyone across the political spectrum is conscious of the need for  additional investment in mental-health services in Northern Ireland. However, yet  again, there is a reluctance to match rhetoric with actions where finance is  concerned.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I could highlight others  issues including environmental protection; arts funding; public  transport; transport infrastructure in general; and investing in the economy.  The list of public services that are being underfunded is substantial.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is worth noting once  again that several organisations, including the Economic Research  Institute of Northern Ireland (ERINI), the Confederation of British Industry  (CBI) and Northern Ireland Council for Voluntary Action (NICVA), have  challenged the approach that has been taken in the Budget to household  taxation. I appreciate that the Minister has outlined recently his reasons for disagreeing with those organisations&rsquo;  analysis; he is perfectly entitled to do so, and, no doubt, I will also  disagree with their analysis in some respects. However, it is worth recognising  that important, credible organisations in our society believe that we have  taken a populist, rather than an evidence-based, approach to local taxation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For different reasons, those organisations recognise that  additional resources should be reinvested in either first, rebalancing the  economy &mdash; the belief of the CBI and ERINI &mdash;  or secondly, in addressing social problems &mdash; the belief of NICVA. The  Alliance Party does not want to see the tax burden here become any more arduous  than it currently is, but serious questions must be asked about an approach to  local taxation that is based on populism rather than evidence.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Clearly, the Alliance Party&rsquo;s proposals would not be able  to cover all areas of investment, but they would make more of a start than the  Executive have done to date. To clarify the Alliance Party&rsquo;s position on income  issues, it would involve a focus on three areas. First, the cost of segregation  would have to be addressed and funds for reinvestment elsewhere should be  released, thus potentially reducing taxation in the long run. Secondly, the  Alliance Party would also pursue efficiency savings, although in that regard a  subtle distinction should be made &mdash; for the Alliance Party, efficiency savings  do not involve merely doing the same with fewer resources, but rather ensuring  that resources are transferred from inefficient old priorities to more  efficient new priorities and to meeting new demands. Thirdly, we would follow  an evidence-based approach to local taxation. Rather than going from one  extreme that comprises rates hikes to the other, effectively cutting rates, we  would take a balanced approach, striving to keep rates in and around at the  level of inflation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Another consequence of the policy that has been adopted is  that the parity principle may be under threat. For almost 60 years, Northern Ireland has matched the levels of  social security provision in Great    Britain. However, an assumption that the tax  burden should be standardised as far as possible throughout the United Kingdom  is behind part of the bargain that the Executive wish to make. How will the  Treasury react to the approach that has been taken on local taxation?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, how will this &mdash; or any future &mdash; Executive be  able to argue credibly for favourable funding, given that the resources that we  receive are used for a populist approach to taxation, rather than for further  investment in sustainable public services? That is a strange approach for  unionists to take, to say the least. I am also concerned about the message that  the Executive are sending out to wider society: they are creating unrealistic expectations regarding local  taxation issues. The Executive may be placing themselves in a financial  straitjacket. There will be a time when the Executive will need to raise funds  from the regional rate to pay for local services, and I fear that they are  making things more difficult for themselves in the long run. A rise in rates in  or around the rate of inflation would be more sustainable and would be a way to  avoid those difficulties. Above all, this argument is academic, given the  debacle concerning Northern Ireland Water and the very steep charges that  people in Northern Ireland  may now be facing.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive have agreed what is effectively a right-wing  Budget, and I congratulate the Minister&rsquo;s success in getting the other three  Executive parties to sign up to it. They have all made their choices in that  regard. However, I remind the members of all the political parties that are in  the Executive that they must be careful about how they argue for things over  the months and years to come. They have all made their choices to sign up to  the Budget, and, by implication, to the approach that has been taken to the  regional rate. In so doing, they have no credibility when they raise issues  regarding the underfunding of health, education or transport. People cannot  have it both ways when they are in Government. I note that all the Executive  parties have made that point in the past: we cannot have it both ways.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party&rsquo;s approach is the reasonable and  realistic one, and I think that the people of Northern Ireland appreciate and understand it. my colleagues  and I are hearing on doorsteps and in our constituency offices about  people&rsquo;s concerns for the future of the public services in Northern Ireland,  particularly the Health Service. People need to be realistic when they consider  the parties in this Assembly and the decisions that they are making. They must  ask themselves whether those decisions add up.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Dr Farry&rsquo;s contribution was longer than the two that preceded it. My  contribution may be slightly longer than  those of Mr O&rsquo;Loan and Mr Beggs, but it will not be as lengthy as that  of the Member for North Down. That will be  another relief for the rate&shy;payers of Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  It took that long for the Alliance Party to explain its position.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  The Member is absolutely right.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Lest there be any doubt, I welcome the introduction of the  Order. It is my rule of thumb that if rates are to be frozen, it is a good idea  to vote for and support that. One reason that I became involved in politics was  to help, in whatever small way I can, to ease the burden faced by ratepayers,  particularly hard-pressed working families, who have endured phenomenal rate  rises in recent years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The rise in the regional rate of over 60% has been  mentioned, and in one year there was an increase of almost 20%. In its own  small way, and within the limited scope that it has, the Assembly is helping to  ease that burden. When the Minister of Finance and Personnel announced the  proposal in his Budget statement towards the end of last year, I thought that  all parties would support it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, much to my surprise and that of many others, the  Alliance Party has consistently opposed the proposal. At meetings of the  Committee for Finance and Personnel, the Alliance Party was joined by the PUP  in voting against the Order and by the SDLP in voting against the cap on  industrial rates that will be discussed  later. If such a cap were introduced, businesses would not pay any  higher rates than they do now.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Many Members view the  Alliance Party&rsquo;s conversion to  old-style tax-and-spend socialism as somewhat curious. It is a strange  switch, and it has resulted in some DUP Members branding the Alliance Party&rsquo;s  spokesman on finance &ldquo;Fidel&rdquo; Farry. However, given the winds of change that are  sweeping through Cuba,  that is perhaps no longer an appropriate name.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Even though this is a serious subject, the Alliance Party&rsquo;s  contributions have resulted in it taking on a comic quality, to the extent that  a more appropriate title would be &ldquo;Bruce Forsyth&rdquo; Farry. Dr Farry takes every  opportunity in the Assembly, at meetings of the Committee for Finance and  Personnel or when addressing the general public to say &ldquo;Higher, higher.&rdquo; He  wants people&rsquo;s rates bills to be even higher than they are now. However,  perhaps &ldquo;Bruce Forsyth&rdquo; Farry is not an appropriate name either, because not  too many people will say &ldquo;Good game, good game&rdquo; or &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he do well?&rdquo; to him  when he talks to them on their doorsteps during the run-up to the next  election.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party states that it merely seeks a rise in  the regional rate that is based on the rate of inflation, which, it argues  would be a more measured option. However, when Members of the Alliance Party  are pressed on how much the rise should be, they do not come up with an answer.  Dr Farry repeatedly referred to health, and the Alliance Party subscribes to  the claptrap that there is an annual &pound;200 million shortfall in funding for  health over the period of the Budget, totalling &pound;600 million over the three  years. To raise that money through a rise in the regional rate would require an  increase of over 200%.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  The figure of a &pound;200 million shortfall in funding came from the Economic  Research Institute of Northern Ireland: was it talking claptrap?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  The amount of money that has consistently been allocated to the health budget  over the years has resulted in the current situation in which, compared with  the start of the decade, its budget has doubled. The money involved is not a  small amount: it has doubled from &pound;2 billion to over &pound;4 billion. There are massive  inefficiencies in the Health Service.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  Does the Member accept that the Member for North Down said that the Alliance  Party was perfectly justified and right in opposing an 8% increase in the  regional rate during the Assembly&rsquo;s previous mandate because it meant a 75p  increase a week per household? Now, however,  Dr Farry advocates that a further &pound;200 million be raised through an  increase in the regional rate. That would mean an increase well in excess of 8%  in rate bills, but during the current mandate he can justify that.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Mr Wilson is correct. An increase based on inflation would raise a paltry  figure relative to the massive increase in spending that the Alliance Party  seeks. It would not even scratch the surface of the amount that their spending  plans require. Even to raise the &pound;200 million to meet the shortfall over the  three-year period would require an increase of over 200% in the regional rate.  The average bill would increase by &pound;920 from the current figure of just over  &pound;400. The Alliance Party wants to inflict that burden on people.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">1.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  understand that the Member studied accountancy at Queen&rsquo;s at the same time that  I read political philosophy, so I will perhaps challenge his point about  socialism and communism later. He said that the Northern Ireland regional rate  raises some &pound;590 million per annum, and yet he referred to an increase of &pound;200  million as a doubling of the regional rate. Surely &pound;200 million is merely a  fraction of &pound;590 million, rather than a multiple? That is not to say, of  course, that the Alliance Party advocates the funding of that gap from the  regional rate. However, given that he has an accountancy degree, can the Member  explain how he does his sums?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I thank the Member for his intervention. It is not, of course, a blanket total  of &pound;200 million that has been asked for; rather, the figure is &pound;200 million per  year, totalling &pound;600 million over the period. When I heard of that demand  coming from the Alliance Party, and from other Benches, I asked the Department  of Finance and Personnel by how much that would increase the regional rate. The  answer was that the regional rate would have to increase by 228% to &pound;920. That  is how much it would cost; that would be the  burden on the taxpayer. Indeed, that is only a fraction of the burden  that would be incurred if Alliance Members&rsquo; wishes were granted. They want a  litany of things, from environmental protection to the arts, and everything in  between. They want more and more &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  Tractor farms.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>: Tractor farms and the euro. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  Gulags for &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Yes, maybe they could break down the cost of division with an integrated gulag.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That &pound;600 million, and the doubling or even trebling of the  regional rate, would only be the start of the Alliance Party&rsquo;s plans. Those of  us who listened for years to the Alliance Party crying out for devolution under  any circumstances, so that a difference could be made from the direct rule state of affairs, are bewildered by the  latest nonsense coming from their Benches.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This is a difference from direct rule. If direct rule had  been in place today, the people of Northern Ireland would have faced a  massive increase in their regional rate, on top of what they have already paid  over the years. Businesses too would, undoubtedly, already be facing the  prospect of 50% industrial rates, rising to 100% in a few years. That is the  difference that this Assembly is making;  that is the difference that devolution is making. I warmly welcome the  introduction of this Order, and give it my wholehearted support.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Mr Hamilton, thank you for the insight into your level of  television viewing.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I am glad of the opportunity to question the Minister on this subject. I  welcome his report and the opportunity for local involvement, at Assembly  level, on the issue of regional rates. Some time ago, I brought the matter of  regional rates for properties with agricultural occupancy clauses to the  Minister&rsquo;s attention, and there was discussion between us and with other bodies  about it. Estate agents have opined that the value of properties with such  clauses is 40% to 50% less than it would otherwise be.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Is the Minister now in  a position to tell the Assembly whether he has addressed that anomaly in  the rating system? It has already had, and will continue to have, a great  effect on a number of people in my constituency of Strangford, and, indeed, on  people throughout the Province. I am not sure exactly how many people are affected,  but it impacts on anyone who has a property with an agricultural occupancy  clause.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: I  welcome a couple of things in what the Finance Minister said. He said that this  was about setting out a new approach to the regional rate so as to avoid the massive  increases that we have had in the last number of years, and to ensure that the  public sector delivers. I do not believe that there is an elected  representative in this Chamber who would wish that we did otherwise.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, he also talked about controlling the level of the  regional rate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Although the sentiment is admirable, my party&rsquo;s  concern is not about the current level of the regional rate but about the  creation of a boom-and-bust cycle in which huge hikes for several years will be  followed by a complete freeze that will then force another couple of huge  hikes. The Alliance Party does not believe that that way forward is  sustainable. My party&rsquo;s concern is that,  for the public&rsquo;s sake, rates bills are properly managed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My party also welcomes efficiency savings. No one who sits  in the Chamber believes that there is no room for efficiency savings in the  public sector &mdash; no one is arguing otherwise. However, the Assembly must  carefully consider areas in the public sector where the problem is underfunding,  not lack of efficiency, and must confront that wherever it exists. No one  argues against efficiency savings, because everyone wants to have efficient  public services. However, to achieve efficiency, the Assembly must control  spending and must not get into a negative cycle in which it freezes rates while  knowing that doing so will put it under pressure later. It is a matter of  long-term planning.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Several Members asked valid questions during the debate. However, I disagree with them in  interpretation. For example, everyone agrees that some of the rates  hikes that occurred during direct rule were excessive. There is no question  about that, and a particular political point was being made. Dr Farry made a  significant point when he highlighted the fact that the Government, which still  retains control of the Treasury and the allocations that the Assembly receives  from that quarter, are the same Government who believe that the contribution  level from local householders in Northern Ireland must be increased.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly is now in  control and cannot be forced to raise those funds through rates in the  sort of measure that the Government have during the past three years. However,  it will not go unnoticed if the Assembly freezes rates and then goes to the  Treasury to ask for additional resources. The Assembly must be careful to  ensure that when it approaches the Treasury, it does so with a rational and  reasonable argument and can defend its position.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Roy Beggs Jnr mentioned poverty and the working poor. It is  right that those matters be raised. Part of my concern is that people who fall  into the category of the working poor will be those most damaged by the  unpredictability of their future finances; the boom-and-bust cycle in which rates are fine for two years and then become  outrageously expensive at the next top-up.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When those issues were debated in Belfast City Hall,  colleagues who sit to my left in the Chamber made the point repeatedly that the  problem was the lack of a measured approach towards rates &mdash; 19% increases and  so forth &mdash; which damages people because they cannot plan for their future  effectively. Therefore, for the sake of the working poor, there must be some  predictability about what rates increases are likely to be &mdash; not only during  the next year or three years, but in the long term.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Simon Hamilton quite rightly identified the fact that it  would be easy to support the argument for no rates increase. Of course, it  would be easier to tell the public that the Assembly will not be asking them  for any more money. If the Assembly stopped at that point, it would be incredibly easy. However, the Alliance  Party believes that the Assembly  must be responsible and must tell the public that rates must be managed  in a regular and measured way in order that it can deliver public services. Dr  Farry clearly explained the consequences of not raising the required amount of  money.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It would be easy and popular for the Assembly to simply  back the notion of having no rates increase. It would be easy to put one&rsquo;s hand  up in favour of such a move. However, what is difficult to do is to articulate  a constructive argument as to why rates  must be managed differently. The Alliance Party has been accused of  saying no again &mdash; in fact, that is not true. My party does not want to be  destructive and negative: it wants to put forward constructive, alternative  arguments, which is the opposition&rsquo;s role in this place.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My party has also been accused of wanting to spend a huge  amount of money. Frankly, that makes me want to laugh. If one examines the  manifestoes of every party in the Chamber, it is clear that all of them made  considerable commitments to the public. The difference is that the Alliance  Party thought through the consequences of the commitments that it made and was  aware of what must be done differently in order to meet those commitments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Realistically, all parties must be serious when they write  their manifestos and make their promises, because &mdash; since devolution &mdash; private  Members&rsquo; motions have consistently called for more money for this, more money  for that and more investment in the other. Those motions have come from all the  parties, and the majority of them have not come from the Alliance Party &mdash; that  is a false statement. Members constantly call for extra money, and I look  forward to future private Members&rsquo; motions that explain from where the money  will be taken.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That is the challenge that has been put to those of us in  opposition, and I put it back to those in Government.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  Believe it or not, I am grateful to all the Members who contributed to the  debate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said earlier, the  Order provides the Administration with a vital tool to raise much-needed  additional revenue to fund public expenditure on key services and provisions.  Therefore, it is imperative that we use it wisely and get the correct balance  between what is reasonable to levy on households and commercial premises, while  raising sufficient funds to meet our spending requirements. We have that balance  right this year and in the years of the CSR period; the public will see an  Administration that makes a difference to their lives by delivering on its  promises and being in touch with what is required to improve our services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As custodians of the money raised through the regional  rate, it is our job to ensure that that money is used to its maximum potential.  That way, we will be able to realise a more vibrant economy and better quality  services for all our people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The main arguments on the amount set in the Order have been  covered in previous debates on the Budget. Dr Farry used the same speech that  he used on two or three occasions &mdash; it does not improve the more that one hears  it. He stated, correctly, that parties cannot have it both ways. However, while  he was saying that he was attempting to have it both ways. We must have an  open, transparent and honest debate on the issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Dr Farry deliberately does not say how much additional  revenue is required to meet his aspirations for health, transport and education.  Every now and again, he makes inaccurate quips about the amount of underfund.  People in Northern Ireland  have 7% more money a head spent on them in health than people in Great Britain &mdash;  not less. If Dr Farry is going to enter the  debate, he should at least do so with accurate figures.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I will give way in a moment. However, the Member might want to wait for a while  because, as I continue there will be a few more questions for him to answer.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I agreed with one thing that Dr Farry said. The public are  intelligent and able to see what politicians are up to. We have seen what the  Alliance Party is up to &mdash; they try to show that they can meet their  requirements for health, education and transport with an inflation-based  increase in the regional rate for householders in Northern Ireland. In my statement,  I said that &mdash; taking inflation at 2&middot;7% &mdash; an inflation-based increase would  realise &pound;5&middot;86 million. Will Dr Farry tell me how the &pound;5&middot;86 million, which &mdash; as  he says he wants &mdash; would be raised by an inflation-based increase in the  regional rate, will pay for the &pound;200 million that he wants to spend in health,  not to mention the millions he wants to spend in education or transport? His  shopping list may be even longer than that. The Member must be straight with  the people of Northern    Ireland &mdash; if he asks for large sums of money  for those worthy causes, the cost of which he would add onto the rates, he must  tell people that he will treble their rates, rather than double them.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">1.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The answer to the  question that he put to my colleague is that the &pound;590 million is not the  amount of money from the regional rate from households but from households and  non-domestic properties. Therefore, my friend is right to say that the &pound;200  million would have doubled the regional rate. That is what the Alliance Party  wants. Not content with a 62% increase over the past five years, it wants to  more than double the regional rate for the next few years.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  have two points to make. First, I freely recognise that more money is spent per  capita on health provision in Northern Ireland  than is spent elsewhere in the United    Kingdom. The reason for that is, sadly, that  we have greater health need per capita in Northern Ireland, and, therefore, the Budget allocations  reflect that need. The Alliance Party&rsquo;s point is that, as a result of the  current Budget, our inability to keep up with healthcare standards in the rest  of the UK  has led to our falling behind. We are flatlining.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, I made it  clear that the Alliance Party does not have the resources or access to  the detailed information that is needed to provide a fully costed Budget.  However, I have sought to highlight three areas to do with income: first, the  costs of a having a divided society must be dealt with, and no doubt we shall return to that point in our meeting with  the Minister next week; secondly, possible efficiency savings must be  highlighted; and, thirdly, a more responsible approach to the regional rate  must be sought.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party has not sought, at this stage, to  address how it would fund the underfunding of our public services. However, the  several different income strands that we have set out for Northern Ireland  can be dealt with.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  The Member has no shame whatsoever. He tells us that he does not possess the  resources to garner together an argument, yet he states his approach as if it  were fact. He has admitted that he does not have the resources at his disposal  to realise what the real financial position is. Perhaps he should use Assembly  facilities &mdash;Committee and Library resources &mdash; to obtain the facts so that he  might return with answers. However, I suspect that to do so would scuttle his  argument.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member accuses me of adopting a popular rather than an  evidence-based approach. Let me give him that evidence. The increases under  direct rule have been significantly higher than anybody in Northern Ireland should have been asked to bear. A 62% increase  over the past five years is unacceptable,  but the Member evidently does not think so. If we are to redress the  balance, we are right to do what we have done &mdash; freeze rates. I would have  thought that, after his recent radio broadcast, the Member would have  recognised that people do not support his stance. I do not know what doors he  has been knocking on, but people to whom I have spoken welcome the fact that  they are to experience some relief from the massive rates hikes of previous  years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I listened to the contribution from the deputy leader of  the Alliance Party. She should have listened to the old saying that one never  refers to rope in the house of a hanged man. It was unwise for her to start to  refer to manifestos. She has obviously forgotten that the Alliance Party&rsquo;s  manifesto for the local government and  Assembly elections stated that there should be rates reductions. Her  party advised people to watch out for the parties that would be in Government, because they would attempt to hike the rates in Northern    Ireland. The exact opposite has now happened; the parties in Govern&shy;ment want to freeze the rates in Northern    Ireland. The Alliance Party has torn the page out of its election manifesto and  now wants to hike the rates in Northern    Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will take no lectures from her about the need to show  consistency on the issue. She argues that to have a hike one day and a freeze  the next day leads to a hike in the future.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">She should know &mdash; if she does not, she should speak to her  husband, who will tell her &mdash; that Castlereagh Borough Council has dealt with  precisely those issues. That is why Castlereagh Borough Council has the lowest  rates in Northern Ireland  and the lowest increases. The council consistently gives the best value to its ratepayers through precisely the same  programme that the Assembly is adopting. We cannot simply pull more  money out of the pockets of the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I will be happy to give way to the Member in one second.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We will get the additional required resources by making  efficiencies in the system. We will save &pound;790 million through efficiencies.  That is the way to do it, rather than asking for more money from people before  we remove the waste from the system. People will welcome that policy.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  The Minister has drawn a parallel between his budgetary approaches for  Castlereagh Borough Council and Northern Ireland.  Will he concede that the difference is that, unlike in Castlereagh,  where people can hop on a bus and go to Belfast  to use the services that are provided there, people in Northern Ireland  will not have the option to go elsewhere when times become difficult and  service provision is low, as it has been in Castlereagh?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  If the Member knew a bit more about the subject, she would know that more  people hop on buses to go to facilities in Castlereagh than the other way  around. Recreation facilities in Castlereagh make money for the council,  whereas facilities in Belfast  lose money. The Member might wish to take some lessons from Castlereagh in that  respect. The Member for East Antrim Mr Wilson found it so difficult to pay the  rates in Belfast  that he decided to move to Larne, so Mrs Long should not try to egg him on to  intervene in the debate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mrs Long raised the issue of unpredictability. How can she  talk about the unpredictability of future rating when &mdash; for the first time ever  &mdash; a Minister has given predictability to  the business sector and to householders in Northern Ireland? We have told  people what the regional rate will be for the next three years. That is total  predictability until the end of the mandate of this Assembly. No previous Minister has offered householders or the  business sector that degree of predictability so that they can plan their  finances in the longer term. I would have thought that, instead of criticising  that, the Member would have thanked the Executive for providing people with a  longer run-in time in which to assess their finances for the next three years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member for Strangford Mr Shannon mentioned what I will  describe as a &ldquo;horticulture allowance&rdquo;, which would be an extension of the  existing farmhouse allowance. The Member came to see me with one of his  constituents, and he made a strong case. He pointed out the similarities  between the horticulture and farming sectors. My officials have been tasked  with assessing how widespread that issue is and examining ways in which we  might best address it. Addressing the matter in the way in which the Member has  suggested will probably require primary legislation. Therefore, my Department  is gathering evidence, and officials have written to the Department of the  Environment&rsquo;s Planning Service about the number of houses that have user  restrictions imposed by the planning system for horticultural reasons.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have covered the issues that were raised during the debate, and I hope that I have at least covered  Members&rsquo; substantive points. If, on reading Hansard, I discover some  issue that I have not covered, I will write to the Member concerned.</p>

	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved (with cross-community support):</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly approves the Rates (Regional Rates) Order  (Northern Ireland)  2008.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading"><a name="3"></a>Rates (Industrial Hereditaments) (Amendment) Order (Northern Ireland) 2008</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr P Robinson)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly approves the Rates (Industrial  Hereditaments) (Amendment) Order (Northern Ireland) 2008.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Order will enable us to hold the rates for  commercial premises at 30% for the next three years. It is a short but  important Order that marks a significant break with the direct rule policy. The  Order is a sign that devolution is delivering for the people of Northern Ireland.  There are some who have said that devolution is no different than direct rule  and that we may as well be governed from Westminster.  However, those who wanted to see a continuation of direct rule, and the Labour  Party setting policy in the Province, were playing a part in punishing the  manufacturing sector and costing Northern Ireland much-needed jobs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The agenda of this Administration is not the same as that  of the direct rule Labour Government. Those who oppose devolution are  supporting the return of a failed Labour Party policy in Northern Ireland.  That agenda was to increase taxes on business: our agenda is to ensure better  delivery from the public sector.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Making the economy the Executive&rsquo;s top priority is not only  about words, but actions. Therefore, the Rates (Industrial Hereditaments)  (Amendment) Order (Northern Ireland) 2008 is not only important for the  much-needed relief for the manufacturing sector but for the message that it  sends from the Administration to those who want to do business in Northern  Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The policy of industrial derating dates back to 1929. The  decision to phase out that relief was announced in April 2003 by direct rule  Ministers who wished to phase it out entirely. That process began on 1 April  2005, with full rates on industrial property due on 1 April 2011.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members will be aware that, since then, there has been  concern that the measure will have a detrimental effect on business. As a  result, the Department of Finance and Personnel commissioned a review by the  Economic Research Institute of Northern Ireland, which was published in early  November 2007. I am grateful to the institute for its work, but, as its report  emphasised, the decision on the level of industrial rates must lie with  democratically elected politicians.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">During the debate on the draft Budget, I announced that we  should hold the current level of industrial rates at 30%. The Order will  facilitate that until 2011, and changes will have to be made to primary  legislation to deal with the issue beyond that date.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have already stated that the Administration have set  economic growth as a top priority. We must demonstrate that to our  manufacturing sector, and, by approving the Order, we will do precisely that.  In making my decision in October, I was confident that the Assembly would support  such a move, because I had read carefully  the views expressed by all the parties during the June 2006 debate on  freezing industrial rates, when the motion was passed unanimously.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I see that the Member for North Down is getting a little  cautious &mdash; and so he should be, in case he takes the same line as he took in  the Committee and hears quoted back to him some of the things that the Alliance  Party and others said during that debate in June 2007.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, I am grateful to the Committee for Finance and  Personnel and to the Executive, who have endorsed my position on both the  policy and the draft legislation that I present to the House. Although it is  not a perfect solution, few ways remain open to us to support local industry,  given the extent to which our hands are tied by the European Union. In fact, EU  state aid rules do not allow us to return to 100% derating.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to the longer term, I hope to bring before the  Assembly an amendment to the primary rating Order to deal with the situation  after 2011 and to hold the level of industrial rates at 30% for the longer  term. Our current provision is, to quote the ERINI report, a &ldquo;blunt  instrument&rdquo;. Were we starting from scratch, we might not introduce such a  provision; nevertheless, in providing relief to our manufacturing sector on an  annual fixed cost, this Order will give industry some confidence in financial  planning. We must give a positive signal at this time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The ERINI study  included a survey of manufacturing firms, which revealed what a significant  number said they would do in the event of future rate increases. Approximately  25% thought that they would transfer production to locations outside Northern Ireland.  Other consequences included abandoning or  scaling down future expansion plans, as well as pay freezes or reducing  employment. Most firms who responded said that full implementation of  industrial rates would have adverse effects on employment, with a freeze on  replacing employees who leave and restrictions on recruitment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Given the tough time our manufacturing sector is  experiencing, we cannot ignore the comments of those in the front line who, in  partnership with Government, are creating wealth and revitalising our economy.  Equally, when there are serious issues of political and administrative  bureaucracy to address, we should not ask the business sector to pay for such  inefficiency.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I shall briefly describe each of the articles of the Order.  Article 1 provides the title of the Order and gives its operational date as the  day following that of its affirmation by this Assembly. Article 2 amends the  current provision in schedule 7 to the Rates (Northern Ireland) Order 1977, which  provides the level of industrial rates for the next three financial years. The  level will be 30% of the net annual value of for each of those years. The  current levels set out in the legislation are 50% for the year beginning 1  April 2008, and 75% for the years beginning 1 April 2009 and 1 April 2010.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I commend the Order to the Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel (Mr Storey)</strong>: I thank  the Minister for bringing the motion to the House. The purpose of the statutory  rule is to determine that the non-domestic rates on an industrial property will  be assessed on 30% of its net annual value over the next three financial years  from April 2008. Members will be aware that, when devolution returned, the  Minister of Finance and Personnel decided to await the outcome of ERINI&rsquo;s  review of industrial derating before taking any decision on the issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Having studied ERINI&rsquo;s preliminary report, and in light of  ERINI&rsquo;s assessment that to phase out derating would indeed pose a risk to some  of our manufacturing firms, the Minister announced as part of his draft Budget  statement that the current level of rates would be held at 30% over the next  three years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Following the Minister&rsquo;s announcement, both DFP officials  and ERINI briefed the Committee on 14 November  2007 as part of the Committee&rsquo;s consideration of the draft Budget. The  Committee considered the proposal carefully  and concluded in its report as follows:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The proposal to freeze industrial rate liability at  30% across the Budget period is in keeping with the increased focus on the  economy. However, [...] the ERINI report found little evidence to suggest that  full industrial rating would lead to a collapse in manufacturing with  substantial loss of output and jobs beyond existing trends in the sector. [...]  ERINI also suggested that proceeding to a 50% liability would incur only a  relatively small risk to industry as a whole.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Committee, therefore, noted in its report on  the draft Budget:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;scope exists for a future review of the 30%  liability.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">However, it supported the Minister in proposing the  retention of the 30% manufacturing liability for the time being.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee emphasised in its report that, though mindful  that industrial derating represents one of the few fiscal tools at the  Executive&rsquo;s disposal, it considered this policy to be:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;outdated and a blunt instrument in terms of promoting  economic development and sustainability in the long term.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee therefore formally recommended that DFP  further consider:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the scope for modifying the industrial derating  scheme in the longer term to encourage increased business activity in areas  which would lead to higher productivity&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">such as research and development and exporting  marketing.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the event that the scheme could not be modified without contravening EC state aid rules, the  Committee further agreed to support ERINI&rsquo;s suggestion that the  Executive take:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the opportunity afforded by the review of industrial  derating to build a new concordat between industry and Government which will  specify what each can expect from the other in obligation and support.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">DFP&rsquo;s response to the Committee&rsquo;s report on the draft  Budget is being presented to the Committee on 12 March. Members will look  forward to what is being proposed in relation to this recommendation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to the provisions in the statutory rule, DFP  officials briefed the Committee on the proposals on 6 February and the  Committee formally considered the rule on 20 February. At that meeting, a  motion to recommend that the rule be affirmed by the Assembly was approved by a  majority vote of the Committee. As the Deputy Chairperson of the Committee, I  therefore support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  The Ulster  Unionist Party and I support the retention of industrial rating at 30% and  oppose the escalator that had been implemented in the direct rule Ministers&rsquo;  legislation. In the last couple of years I have visited a number of industrial  sites, and I have learned that the  increased cost of rates for industrial manufacturing companies would  result in a reduction of R&amp;D and put at risk future investment in sizeable  plants, and even smaller ones. Ultimately, it would reduce employment. This is  a real issue; it is not a theoretical question as to whether it would have an  effect or not. Anyone who speaks to most of the companies in Northern Ireland  will understand that they have to make profits in order to spend money on  R&amp;D and make investments in the future. In Committee, the Alliance Party  opposed the freeze at 30%. I warn the public, and Alliance voters, that the implementation of  that policy would be unfortunate. I support the retention of rating at 30%.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are a limited number of things that this Assembly can  do, with immediate effect, to improve the prospects of local companies. The  Varney Review II is under way, and we all hope that it will identify some tax  changes to assist the local economy. This matter is within our remit and  control, and so I urge the Assembly, particularly in the run-up to the  investment conference in May, to give a  clear direction that it wishes to encourage private business. That will  mean real jobs in the economy. For that reason, I support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  agree with the Minister that our manufacturing industry requires support.  Although this measure is a blunt instrument, it is one of the few available to  the Minister. Manufacturing requires long-term assurances, and the ERINI report  recommended that, whatever the level struck, industrial rates should be held  for several years. Therefore, I support the Minister when he refers to  considering the long term.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My only one concern, which I expressed in the Committee, is  that an issue raised in the ERINI report has not been adequately addressed. It  is not my intention to allow that to cause a Division; on the contrary, I  support the Order&rsquo;s intention to freeze industrial rates at 30%.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I mentioned that point during the Budget debate, and I  quoted from the ERINI report. In essence, when gathering industry evidence,  ERNI&rsquo;s experience, particularly with the manufacturing industry, was that the  relationship between industry and Government was poor and that industry was not  understood and supported. I therefore welcome the emphasis on that matter from  the Deputy Chairperson of the Finance and  Personnel Committee, Mr Storey. The Committee&rsquo;s &lsquo;Report on the  Executive&rsquo;s Draft Budget 2008-2011&rsquo; states:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Committee recommends that DFP considers further  the scope for modifying the industrial derating scheme in the longer term to  encourage increased business activity in areas which lead to higher  productivity (e.g. research &amp; development, export marketing). In the event  that the scheme cannot be modified directly without contravening EC state aid  rules, the Committee would support the approach, suggested in the Economic  Research Institute of Northern Ireland (ERINI) report, of the Executive taking  the opportunity of the review of industrial derating to build a new concordat  between industry and government, which will specify what each can expect from  the other in obligation and support.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">To that end, I call for action from the Assembly,  and, given that ERINI&rsquo;s report came first to the Department of Finance and  Personnel and that the Committee has expressed its desire for the Department to  play a role, it clearly must do so. In addition, the Department of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment (DETI) and the Department for Employment and Learning  (DEL) are also fundamentally involved. All those Departments must acknowledge  that a real need exists and begin to put in  place measures that might create such a concordat. Forming a new  relationship between industry and Government is not just a task for Government;  the manufacturing industry also has a responsibility.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Northern Ireland Manufacturing Focus Group campaigned  powerfully on industrial derating, and it now has an opportunity, and a  challenge, to do a much more interesting and, in the long term, significant  job, which will be to work alongside the Government here in order to put the  manufacturing industry in a better position to compete in the global  marketplace.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: It  always strikes me as a paradox that we debate Private Members&rsquo; Business for  hours, with many Members contributing, whereas, when it comes to discussing  formal legislation and making it a reality, the debates are rather limited. I  recognise that both the Ulster Unionist Party and the SDLP have contributed a  little more to this debate than they did to the last; however, I note that Sinn  F&eacute;in members have still to speak, and I hope that that will be addressed later.  It is important that these matters are not only debated by the Alliance Party  and the DUP and that other parties nail their colours to the mast.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party has major concerns about this statutory  rule, and there is neither a sound economic nor financial rationale behind the  policy articulated by the Minister.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In his introductory remarks, he articulated a very  selective reading of the ERINI report. It is worth noting that the report  suggested that it was safe to raise the level to 50% and that the risks would  be minimal. It pointed out that not doing  so would lead to opportunity costs for the public purse and for wider  economic policy. ERINI also raised concerns about the nature of the survey that  it conducted with the manufacturers.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Industrial derating is  an old-fashioned and outmoded form of  industrial support, as the Deputy Chairperson of the Finance Committee  recognised in his opening remarks. It was introduced on a UK-wide level in  1929, the year of the Great Depression &mdash; although I am not sure whether there  is a direct link between those two events. The practice was phased out in England in 1963 and in Scotland in  1995, and few other modern economies deploy it. Thus it is an old-fashioned  form of support. It is too much of a blunt instrument to be effective. It is  not about creating a modern economy; frankly, it is about preserving what we  have rather than trying to rebalance the economy and engage with the new global  realities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There have been comments on the Varney Review&rsquo;s very sound  analysis of the situation in Northern    Ireland &mdash; although its recommendations were  not overly sound. It is worth noting that  it does not view industrial derating as a major advantage to the Northern Ireland  economy. I am concerned about remarks that have been made about this policy  being critical as we look towards the investment conference. Frankly,  industrial derating is not a major issue for investors. They want to see a  modern-looking, forward-thinking economic policy, not one that is designed to hold  back the tide of international trends.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  The Member has said that he believes that the policy is not critical. Does he  accept that as well as determining whether there will be new investment from  foreign direct investors, this policy can impact on where existing companies  invest? Many Northern   Ireland  companies are linked to sister companies in other parts of the United Kingdom  or in the Republic of Ireland. Whether those companies decide to invest will be  determined by a range of factors. Regrettably, our energy and transports costs  are generally slightly higher than the costs in the rest of the United Kingdom.  Does the Member accept that, in order to ensure that there will be continued  investment in R&amp;D and plant &mdash; thereby making our economy efficient &mdash; it is  important to encourage existing local companies that operate in Northern Ireland?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  would encourage the Member to read the ERINI report. It sets out that the major  cost issues facing manufacturing in Northern Ireland are labour, transport  and energy. Property is quite far down the list. The analysis from ERINI &mdash; and  also in the regional forecasts &mdash; pointed out that the level of risk was quite  minimal in that respect. If the argument is being made that this policy should  be in place as some sort of counter-subsidy for our energy, transportation and labour costs, the answer is to address those  problems rather than allow this  policy to create a further problem.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As regards the investment conference, rather than look  backwards, it is important to look to the future competitiveness of Northern Ireland  and how well it sells itself. The policy is not an effective way of attracting  foreign direct investment or of engaging with the global economy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is also worth reflecting that industrial derating  applies to some sectors of the economy but not others. Some commercial  activities benefit, while others do not. That in itself is not fair, but it  also begs the question as to whether the correct sectors are being subsidised.  Indeed, while manufacturing contributes a considerable amount of gross value  added (GVA) to the Northern    Ireland economy,  it is worth noting that many of the  potentially higher GVA-producing  activities would not be covered by the industrial derating policy. In  that respect, it does not help to rebalance the economy and to encourage those  GVA conversions that the Executive are rightly talking about.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The EU market rules mean that industrial derating would be  classified as a form of state aid. Industrial derating is permitted only as a  legacy policy that predates the UK&rsquo;s  accession to the European Union.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Hamilton was handing out quite a lot of labels this  morning, particularly in my direction. The DUP and the other parties that have  been vocal in supporting that policy are effectively defending an industrial  policy that is old fashioned and that has an element of statism about it. The  Alliance Party is articulating a pro-market and liberal approach. When I was  speaking during the previous debate, I was also reflecting a liberal approach  to economics.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Member tell the House what industrial experience any member of the  Alliance Party has? I have rarely heard such an amount of drivel from people  who do not know what they are talking about. Dr Farry has rehashed issues that  have been gone over and over again.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Had he talked to people, he would understand the challenges  that the manufacturing industry is faced with. He simply does not understand  what he is talking about when he refers to sunset industries and so on.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The key challenge facing Northern Ireland is productivity.  The only area that enhances productivity is manufacturing. The GVA is &pound;49,000  per employee. Dr Farry is completely wrong. Will he please tell Members what he  bases his arguments on?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: It  was a relief that towards the end of his intervention Mr McCrea got round to  some points of actual substance, as opposed to simply engaging in abuse. The  Member should read the ERINI report, which was commissioned by the Department  of Finance and Personnel.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although I have stated that the manufacturing industry  makes a considerable contribution to GVA, the Member is ignorant in making the  comment that only manufacturing contributes to productivity. That statement is  patently false. If the Member had any understanding of the nature of the UK economy &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I think that there is a  misunderstanding, and I ask that the Member withdraws his remarks. I actually  talked about productivity increases. I did not say that manufacturing was the  only contributor to productivity. Perhaps the Member should listen more  carefully.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Hansard report can be read to clarify that.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  That was more of a point of information under the guise of a point of order.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The biggest increase in GVA in the UK economy over  the past 10 years has come in the areas of financial services, which  have become the main driver of productivity across the UK. Although  some aspects of the service sector produce low GVA, other aspects produce high  GVA.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, I am  suggesting that although it is important that Northern Ireland continues to have  a strong manufacturing presence, it is also important that the economy is  further balanced by appealing to a wider range activities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to consider the differences between the Northern Ireland economy and that of the Republic of Ireland and the nature of economic  activity in both jurisdictions. Radical changes have occurred in the Republic of Ireland over the past 20 years. Unfortunately,  few changes have taken place in Northern    Ireland during the same period.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The arguments for the retention of the policy are weak, and  that was highlighted in Mr Storey&rsquo;s opening remarks. The ERINI report stated  that:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;if Northern    Ireland was starting from a clean sheet and  could choose what form of support to provide for industry there is not the  slightest possibility that we would suggest adopting a policy of industrial  derating.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is an important point.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The main argument for retention is essentially about the  alleged damage that could otherwise be caused to the economy. Of course  manufacturing is still an important element  of the local economy. The fear is that an increase in industrial rating  will have a negative impact on employment and output. Although that may be the  case in some areas, the analysis from ERINI and Regional Forecasts Ltd suggests  that those dangers are significantly overstated; they are perceptions rather  than realities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is forecast that, at a rating of 50%, no more than 10%  of companies would face rates bills that equate to more than 15% of their  profits. Labour, transportation and energy costs are bigger issues for  industry. Some <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">may argue that although,  under EU state rules, industrial</span> derating cannot be introduced, it is permitted  as a legacy policy. Therefore, if Northern Ireland were to reduce the  level of subsidy to manufacturing, it could not return to the current policy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The biggest risk lies in not changing policies. The more  responsible approach is to seek to rebalance the economy &mdash; not to preserve the  status quo. There is a risk involved in not taking the opportunity to do so  using the available resources.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Industrial derating of 30% produces &pound;22 million per annum,  and full derating would produce approximately &pound;70 million per annum. The  Alliance Party proposes a level of 50%, as suggested by ERINI, as the more  responsible approach. That would produce a further &pound;13 million per annum for  the local economy, which equates to approximately &pound;40 million over the period  of the incoming Budget.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The critical economic argument is that the lost resources  and income could be better invested in economic drivers for the general good of  the economy, including manufacturing. I am not a fan of selective financial  assistance, but the ERINI report makes it clear that investing resources in  that way would be a more effective means of providing financial support to the  economy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">At a more general level, the central issue in relation to  business taxation is corporation tax. Members often talk about foreign direct  investment. An adjustment in the rate of  corporation tax would greatly transform the economy. The Alliance Party  remains concerned by the lack of fiscal and tax-varying powers that could be  used wisely to modernise and rebalance the local economy and address the  regional disparities in the UK  economy and the economic imbalances on the island of Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is worth nothing that the Executive seem to have given  up the fight when it comes to corporation tax. No statement has been made to the  Assembly either by <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">the Executive or the  Minister of Finance and Personnel.</span></p>

	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Lifetime Opportunities Strategy</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr  McCartney </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister  to detail when a decision will be made in relation to the lifetime  opportunities strategy. <a name=AQO2374/08>(AQO 2374/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister (Rev Dr Ian Paisley)</strong>: The Executive&rsquo;s commitment to tackling  poverty is clearly outlined in public service agreement (PSA) 7 in the  Programme for Government entitled &lsquo;Making People&rsquo;s Lives Better&rsquo;. The PSA  includes challenging commit&shy;ments to work towards a 50% reduction in child poverty in Northern Ireland by 2010 and its  elimination by 2020.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In line with its statutory obligation under section 16 of  the Northern Ireland (St  Andrews Agreement) Act 2006, the Executive Committee will soon receive <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">proposals for the adoption of a strategy to tackle  poverty</span>, social exclusion and  patterns of deprivation in Northern<span style="letter-spacing:0pt; "> Ireland</span> based on objective need. First, however, the  adoption proposals will be presented to the OFMDFM Committee in advance of the  Executive Committee&rsquo;s considerations.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Ch&eacute;ad-Aire, as an  fhreagra sin. Did the Office of the First Minister and deputy First  Minister take into account the recommendations of the all-party Preparation for  Government Committee when devising the strategy?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: Our ears are open to all. All suggestions that are fed into  OFMDFM will be considered seriously, as they need to be. We hope to produce a  plan that is acceptable and that is capable of achieving the objectives.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>:  The lifetime opportunities strategy was introduced in 2006 against a background  in which 327,000 people live in poverty, of whom 102,000 are children and 54,000 are pensioners. With those  sobering figures in mind, will the First Minister explain what he will  do to offset the effect of his new water tax and rates increases on the life  opportunities of the poorest people in the community, while some of his  millionaire friends have their rates capped at &pound;400,000?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I must point out that I have introduced no new water tax. I do  not know where the Member got the idea that I have produced some new water tax.  I wish that I had a bucket of cold water to pour over him so that he might make  sensible remarks in the House. All that I can say to him is that the Assembly  cannot heal the sore of poverty overnight. There must be a proper plan and the  ability to put that plan into operation in order to achieve everyone&rsquo;s goal.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: Many  of the policy strategies that were adopted under direct rule have been shelved  or abandoned. Would it not be better to review and amend those policies rather  than simply abandon them?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I assure the Member that she can bring any such amendments before  the House and we will listen to what she has to say.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">European Engagement</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr Hamilton </strong>asked the Office of the  First <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">Minister</span> and deputy First Minister to detail the progress  made in ensuring that Northern    Ireland is effectively engaged in relevant  European bodies and committees, in order to maximise available financial  benefits.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO2327/08>(AQO 2327/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: From its inception, President Barroso&rsquo;s task force has presented  a considerable opportunity to enhance Northern Ireland&rsquo;s participation in  European Union initiatives, both financial and non-financial. Tremendous  support and co-operation has been shown to the Assembly by the European  institutions, in particular the Commission. The task force&rsquo;s work is well  advanced.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers have visited Brussels to keep the interest of key  decision-makers, influential people and the European  Commission. We are also using those contacts to ramp up our European  engagement, and that is not just about  financial benefits; it is about building networks, participating in programmes and enhancing the  exchange of experience and expertise.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Office of the Northern Ireland Executive in Brussels builds and  strengthens contacts with a wide range of Brussels-based organisations,  member-state representatives and other regional offices. It also raises our  positive profile at major events in Brussels  such as the Open Days initiative, whereby organisations across all sectors are informed of the opportunity to  work with partnership organisations  throughout the European Union.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I thank the First Minister for his answer and his efforts that secured the  support of the European Commission for the task force and its work. Will he  inform the House when the task force will publish its findings?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I hope to receive the task force&rsquo;s draft report soon. Following a  technical assessment of its recommendations, the European Commission will  engage with Ministers in the spring to discuss our response. Junior Ministers  will oversee that work, including the preparation of our formal response to the  report&rsquo;s findings and recommendations. The monitoring of actions plans and  reporting against targets will be ongoing.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive have a key role in ensuring that all  Departments play a full part in Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  constructive and beneficial engagement with Europe.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am grateful to the First Minister for his reply. I welcome the junior  Minister to his first Question Time &mdash; he is, of course, a former colleague of  mine.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Since May 2007, what steps has the First Minister taken to  engage Northern Ireland as a  region within Europe and create direct links with the EU, as opposed to  national links through Whitehall, which have not  always served Northern    Ireland well?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I remind the Member that we have spoken to people at the highest  level, such as the European commissioners, and successfully got a  representative from Northern Ireland  onto one of the main bodies in Europe &mdash; Northern Ireland will now have a  direct input into that body. We are doing our best to build every bridge to  Europe that we can, and we trust that it will not be a one-way street and that  member states will start to bring some of their good things to Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  I also welcome Mr Donaldson, as a former resident of south Down, in his new  role.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">What arrangements does  OFMDFM have for working with the MEPs from Northern Ireland?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The Northern Ireland MEPs are entitled to be heard; however, I  wish that some of them were heard in Europe and not in Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">50% Remission</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr  Neeson </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister to  detail the discussions it has had with the Northern Ireland Office in relation  to ending the automatic 50% remission for prisoners.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO2293/08> (AQO 2293/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The ending of automatic 50% remission for prisoners is a reserved  matter. That, therefore, is a decision for the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland  to make.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I wish that I had the power to make the decision on the  matter, but unfortunately, I do not. However, the Member will be aware that  last November the Northern Ireland Office published for consultation the draft  Criminal Justice (Northern    Ireland) Order 2008. Among the proposals in  the draft Order is that to end automatic 50% remission on custodial sentences.  Earlier last month, we advised the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland  of our support for that proposal.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>:  Does the First Minister agree that there is widespread concern and alarm  throughout the whole community in Northern Ireland about automatic  50% remission? Does he agree that changes to legislation should be introduced sooner rather than later,  particularly where violent crime is concerned?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I agree with the Member. However, we do not have the power to  change the legislation. Nevertheless, we can make representations to the Secretary  of State, and, as I have said, we have already done so, and we will continue to  do so.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Given that the First Minister has stated that automatic 50% remission is a  reserved matter, he should note that in December 2006, the then Minister with  responsibility for criminal justice, David Hanson, announced that in future the  courts would determine the period that is spent in custody. That time must be  completed in full and without remission before the offender is released under  licence. Some 15 months later, it would be good to know whether that new  situation applies in Northern    Ireland. If it does not, can the First  Minister find out why?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First Minister</strong>: That subject has been discussed with the Secretary of State. I will write to the  honourable Member as to the current position on that.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  The devolution of policing and justice has caught the public imagination  recently. Given the many calls, demands and threats that have been made about that issue, can the First Minister assure  the House that it will not be addressed until there is confidence in the  community?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: There will be no devolution of policing and justice until there  is sufficient community confidence. That has  been stated clearly to the Secretary of State and to the Prime Minister.  The Member is aware of the triple lock that the British Government put on that  matter. He is also aware that at no time did my party say at St   Andrews &mdash; or anywhere else &mdash; that it would move quickly on that  matter. Many issues have yet to be completed to give confidence to the entire  community that the time has come to devolve policing and justice.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">PSA Targets for Children</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mrs  O&rsquo;Neill </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister to  detail the recent changes made to PSA targets for children, as a result of the  funding allocation for children and young people&rsquo;s priorities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2378/08>(AQO 2378/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: All our children will reap the benefits when we achieve our  overarching Programme for Government aim of building:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;a peaceful, fair, and prosperous society in Northern  Ireland, with respect for the rule of law and where everyone can enjoy a better  quality of life&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">We do not underestimate the importance of the  public service agreements that have been set  in all Departments in order to work towards that aim. Our Department, through the junior Ministers, has a role in  co-ordinating policy for children and young people. Changes have been  made in some Departments&rsquo; targets. There are several such changes, and, rather  than take up time now, I will arrange for their details to be forwarded to the  Member.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those challenging targets relate to key departmental  priorities and must be funded appropriately from the Budget allocations.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The three Departments most closely involved in providing  services for children and young people, and which have received additional  funding allocations in the Budget, are the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety; the Department of  Education; and the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. I thank the Minister for his answer. I look forward to  receiving that information in writing. That was what I was going to ask in my  supplementary question.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I will just say to the honourable lady that ensuring that  children are cared for, live in safety, are  protected from abuse and receive the support that they need to achieve their full potential becomes our aim,  and we will work towards achieving those ends.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  What action is being taken by the Office of the First Minister and deputy First  Minister to ensure that all Ministers make timely decisions on the allocation  of resources for children and young people&rsquo;s priorities? Will the First  Minister explain why his Department was found guilty of an underspend of &pound;3&middot;8  million, which was returned in the February monitoring round due to being  unallocated from the children and young people&rsquo;s fund?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: Junior Ministers have been given special responsibility for the  co-ordination of policy and the promotion of the rights and needs of children  and young people. They are driving forward children&rsquo;s issues; they are taking  the lead in reviewing the 10-year strategy, and they will chair the newly  reformed ministerial subcommittee. Junior Ministers have also had a series of  engagements with several voluntary-sector organisations; they liaise with the  Commissioner for Children and Young People, and they will take part in a series  of direct engagements with children and young people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Junior Ministers will shortly submit a detailed work plan,  outlining their proposed actions for the next 12 months. I will write to the  honourable Member about his specific enquiry.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Will the First Minister confirm that, although there was additional money,  there was no new money for children and young people in the Budget? Will he provide details about how  Departments will be compelled to ring-fence money for children and young  people&rsquo;s funding?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: That is not a question for me, but for my friend the Rt Hon Peter  Robinson, who is sitting beside me. I am sure that he will be glad to answer  that question for the lady at any time.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Commissioner for Victims and Survivors</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr  Hilditch </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister  to detail the planned working relationship between the department and the  Commissioner for Victims and Survivors.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO2323/08> (AQO  2323/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: We recently announced our decision to appoint four commissioners  designate and to introduce legislation to establish a commission for victims and survivors. The commission will be  inde&shy;pendent of Government in its day-to-day operation. Our Department  will sponsor the commission, and it is intended that a work programme, which  will give a strategic context to their work, will be agreed with the  commissioners.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hilditch</strong>:  Will the First Minister inform the House of the position of the legislation  that is required to establish the new victims&rsquo; commission?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: All I can say is that that matter is under consideration, and we  hope that we will soon be in a position to sponsor the legislation in the House  that will be necessary to carry out the objectives that we have in mind.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: In  the same vein as the previous question, will the First Minister tell the House  what planned working relationships within the commission for victims and  survivors are envisaged by his Department? Will he give the House some  indication about the status of the current victims&rsquo; commissioners designate,  who been appointed but who do not have a legislative framework in which to  work? What limitations, if any, does that place on their activities?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The legislation will deal with the matters that the honourable  lady mentioned, and they need to be dealt with.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I regret that there is a hold-up, and I hope that it will  be overcome as quickly as possible, so that the needs of those victims can be  dealt with.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burnside</strong>:  Will the First Minister corporately, on behalf of the Office of the First  Minister and deputy First Minister, confirm that it is the opinion of that  unitary office, that those who took part as members of proscribed, illegal,  terrorist organisations &mdash; whether republican or loyalist &mdash; in the Troubles of  the last 35 years will not be defined as victims or relatives, or receive  taxpayers&rsquo; money, and that the concentration of taxpayers&rsquo; money that might be  devoted to that purpose, will be for the innocent victims of terrorism and  members of the security forces and their families?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I hope that the honourable Member will believe me this time. I  have already answered that question, and I answered it as I have always done.  We are talking about victims, and not about those who made them victims. It is  the victims that we will look after.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">European Funding</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">6. <strong>Mr  Campbell </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister  to detail the steps being taken to ensure  that all sections of the community are sufficiently resourced and  informed to avail of future European funding.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2312/08>(AQO  2312/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: Equality of opportunity is an important issue for the Executive  and for our society in Northern    Ireland. The Special EU Programmes Body  (SEUPB), as managing authority for Peace II, is responsible for allocating EU  Peace funding to eligible programmes, and for maintaining a high level of  public awareness, among all sections of the community, of Peace II finding. To that end, the Special EU  Programmes Body will, again, strongly  encourage funding applications from all sections of the community,  through the delivery of awareness seminars and the provision of advice and  guidance to prospective applicants. For the INTERREG IIIA programme, the  Special EU Programmes Body will play a similar role, promoting the available  funding opportunities.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  It is pleasing to know that that will be done. The First Minister is aware of  the problems that beset previous European funding applications, particularly  for the unionist community, that may or may not have been due to the overtly  political nature of the funding regime. Can he outline further steps that can be taken to ensure that all sections of the  community benefit from European funding?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I agree that there have been difficulties in the past, and those  must be solved. All sections of society must be safeguarded. When I was in the  European Parliament, I advocated that a line should be drawn on that matter, so  that all sections of the community got their share of the money. We must now  take steps to see that that arrangement can be put into operation for everyone,  so that all can share in what comes from Europe.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I am sure that the First Minister will join me in commending  the Special EU Programmes Body for its  successful efforts to ensure that all sections of the community have the  capacity to apply for European funding. Will he confirm that programmes will be  designed and allocations made solely on the basis of objective need?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I give the Member that assurance. The Minister of Finance and  Personnel has had talks with Mr Cowen from Dublin on those matters, as far as they  concern both parts of this island.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert  Coulter</strong>: I thank the First Minister for the content of his answer. Will he  look at the possibility of developing rural EU networks, with a view to using EU funding to enhance rural  development and to help address the social, employment and educational  disadvantage created by remoteness?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: Yes. I would like to receive further correspondence from the  Member on that matter so that we can take it up and push on with it as quickly  as possible.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Lisanelly Site, Omagh</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">7. <strong>Mr  McElduff </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister  to detail the efforts it is making to secure the transfer to the Executive of  the Lisanelly Ministry of Defence military site in Omagh.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2383/08>(AQO 2383/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: OFMDFM continues to press the British Government strongly about  the transfer of Lisanelly and other military sites to the Executive. We are  waiting for a response from the Chief Secretary to the Treasury. We recently  met the Secretary of State to discuss that important issue, and we clearly set  out our view that an MOD requirement for the Executive to purchase such sites  at market value is a retraction from the joint declaration position.  Furthermore, we pointed out the substantial impact that such an approach will  have on our investment capacity, and we asked for the Secretary of State&rsquo;s  urgent personal intervention and support. Clearly, we want to see whether the  Secretary of State is able to persuade his colleagues that the sites can be  purchased at market value. The availability of funding for Government to  deliver any development proposals at  redundant military bases is a major difficulty. We will press the issue  again shortly &mdash; directly with the Prime Minister if need be.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  I welcome the First Minister&rsquo;s answer, and I acknowledge that he and his office  are taking the matter seriously. I want to ensure that OFMDFM continues to intervene  in that way because considerable influence must be exerted in respect of the  project.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the First Minister join me in applauding the efforts  of educationalists, the local government sector in Omagh, and the MP for West  Tyrone, who are centrally involved in trying to make that project a reality?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I was going to ask the Member what the MLA for West Tyrone was  doing about that matter. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">OFMDFM is of the mind that this is an urgent matter and  that the promises that were made by the then Chancellor &mdash; who is now the Prime  Minister &mdash; that we would benefit from the sale of those properties must be  kept. The time for keeping promises has come, and we intend to push with all  our might to get what we were promised.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom a fhiafra&iacute; den  Ch&eacute;ad-Aire c&aacute; huair a dh&eacute;anfar cinneadh i dtaobh athnuachan l&aacute;ithre&aacute;n  macasamhail na Ceise Faide agus bheairic Foircille.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Can the First Minister be more specific and tell the House when a decision will be made on the  regeneration of such sites, including the Maze/Long Kesh site and  Forkhill barracks?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I cannot give the Member dates in respect of those matters. The  principle must first be established that we will benefit, and we must put our  hearts and minds to that. The promise that was made by the British Government  must be fulfilled, and the people of Northern Ireland must benefit from  what happens to those sites.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="5"></a>Agriculture and rural development</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Bluetongue</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr G  Robinson </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development to detail  the number of cases of bluetongue recorded in the East Derry/Londonderry  constituency.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2284/08>(AQO 2284/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">11. <strong>Mr  Kennedy </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development to detail  the restrictions in place for the importation of live animals from  bluetongue-infected areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  2353/08)</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development (Ms Gildernew)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a  Cheann Comhairle. With your permission, Mr Speaker, I will answer question 1  and question 11 together.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I can confirm that there have been no cases of bluetongue  in the East Derry constituency. Members are  aware of the animal that was imported to a north Antrim farm, which, on  post-import testing, gave a positive reaction to a polymerase chain reaction  (PCR) test, indicating the presence of the virus. A total of 30 animals have  been culled as a consequence.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Preliminary scientific  evidence from that case suggests that trans-placental transmission of  the bluetongue virus may play a part in the spread of the disease. The findings  of the Veterinary Service and AFBI have been supported by the community  reference laboratory at Pirbright.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The evidence for  vertical and/or oral virus transmission was presented to a European  Commission bluetongue expert working group on 27 February. As a result of  discussions at that meeting, Commission authorities will now consider  introducing proposals on controls, in addition to those in the EU Bluetongue  Regulation (EC No 1266/2007), at the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and  Animal Health (SCoFCAH) meeting tomorrow.  The emerging signs indicate that it is necessary to strengthen the  controls in regulation 1266. However, the Commission will not introduce any  additional controls ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s meeting. In view of that, and in order  to protect our cattle herd and sheep flock from the introduction of the  bluetongue virus, I signed a declaration last week to temporarily suspend the  import of female cattle over 12 months and female sheep over six months from  bluetongue restriction zones. That preliminary action is pending the outcome of  the SCoFCAH meeting and further evaluation of the scientific findings.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The suspension of imports came into effect at 6.00 pm on  Saturday 1 March. The decision was taken by the Executive, and it will be  reviewed this week. The suspension, which is in line with action taken in the  South, does not include animals intended for direct slaughter. All other cattle and sheep imported for breeding and  production from outside the island   of Ireland are restricted  on farms and tested at 10 and 30 days after arrival,  as a matter of routine. Restrictions on subsequent movement are lifted only after receipt of clear  test results.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  Will the Minister outline what steps her Department is taking, and what steps  farmers may be able to take, in the fight against the spread of bluetongue?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  My Department has been proactive in the surveillance and monitoring of the  situation as it has unfolded. The most decisive action that the Department  could have taken was the recommendation to the Executive that we ban imports.  Thankfully, that decision mirrors what the industry is doing. Some farming  groups have already called on the industry to impose a voluntary ban on imports  from bluetongue restriction areas. That is a good example of how we have worked  together to try to protect the industry from this awful disease for as long as  we can.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her initial response. Will she confirm that she has  had discussions with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (DEFRA) about banning live animals from bluetongue-infected areas? Will she  confirm that the action taken by the Executive last week &mdash; and recommended by  her and her Department &mdash; is legal? If Northern   Ireland were to suffer an outbreak of bluetongue and  other countries in the EU banned Northern Ireland exports, what  would the legal implications be?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  It is not helpful to deal with hypothetical questions, so at this stage we will  deal with what we actually know. With regard to my discussions with DEFRA, we  have been working at official level and I spoke to Ministers Hilary Benn and  Jonathan Shaw last Thursday afternoon and told them the action that I was  planning to take to the Executive that day. I discussed the issue with them,  and we will keep in close contact with ministerial colleagues.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In taking the action that I took last week to suspend the  importation of certain animals, I have given due regard to the fact that the EU  Bluetongue Regulation (EC No 1266/2007) was introduced when vectors were  perceived as the sole route of virus transmission. That science is now  changing. The EU experts&rsquo; group has considered the evidence from the north  Antrim case, and the Commission will put a recommendation to SCoFCAH tomorrow  to amend regulation 1266. Therefore, following a decision by the Executive last  Thursday, I have invoked powers in domestic  legislation to suspend imports of female cattle over 12 months and sheep  over six months. The Executive will review the position after the meeting  tomorrow. I trust and hope that this will only be a temporary, precautionary  measure. My action, therefore, anticipates appropriate tightening of the EU rules.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is also a proportionate response to the unfolding  situation. The decision was made after the bluetongue expert working group  meeting, because we awaited the <span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt; ">outcome of  that meeting before acting. We have, therefore</span>, been measured and  proportionate in our response, but we have acted decisively to protect the  industry.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  If it is decided that vaccination against bluetongue becomes the only option to  stem the virus, will the Minister confirm that arrangements are in place to  ensure that there is an adequate supply of vaccine available to meet local  demand; that there will not be any delay in issuing a supply to our farms; and  that some herd and flock sizes and location will not be prioritised at the  expense of others?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  We are working with DEFRA and officials in the Department of Agriculture ,  Fisheries and Forestry (DAFF) to ascertain how best to respond to the  situation, and we are talking about what to do if an outbreak is confirmed.  That is hypothetical at this stage. However, we must keep the situation under  review and act decisively.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said during the debate on 19 February, vaccination is  permitted only when a disease is confirmed  to be circulating in a country, and it may be administered in the  protection and surveillance zones only. Thankfully, we are not in that  position.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We are working closely with our counterparts in England, Scotland,  Wales  and the South to develop a vaccination strategy that will be appropriate to  vaccinate against the spread of disease if the need arises. We are also  continuing to monitor the situation carefully, and we will order vaccine if we  consider that necessary. Vaccine has a limited shelf life. It is not available  currently, and we want to be prudent and proportionate with regard to its purchase.  However, we are keeping everything under constant review and acting  accordingly.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>: I thank the Minister for that information. Will the Minister  outline the details of compensation &mdash; or lack thereof &mdash; that will be paid to  farmers who have bluetongue-infected animals, including those that were  imported and those that are based locally?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development is under no obligation to  pay compensation for imported animals that have been affected by, or exposed  to, the bluetongue virus, in accordance with The Diseases of Animals (Northern  Ireland) Order 1981. That position has been made abundantly clear to the  agriculture industry more times than I can remember, and it is supported by  industry leaders.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If an infected animal was not imported from another  country, compensation will be payable if the Depart&shy;ment requires it to be  slaughtered. Compensation for such affected animals is paid at 50% of the value  of the animal, and compensation at 100% of the animal&rsquo;s value is paid on  unaffected animals.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Northern    Ireland Forest  Service</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Ms Lo </strong>asked  the Minister of Agriculture and Rural  Development what her assessment is of the current policy of the Northern Ireland Forest Service in  relation to recreation at sites under its management.  (AQO 2291/08)</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  The new forestry strategy that was published in March 2006 recognises the  importance of forests in providing public access, quiet enjoyment and  recreation opportunities for local people and visitors. The strategy provides  the policy framework for the Forest Service to make forests available to as  many people as possible and to achieve that by working with partners who have  similar interests.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are up to two million visits per year to forests that  fall within the remit of the Forest Service. The Forest Service operates six  forest parks and many forests, all of which provide open public access and  which are well used by walkers. Many of those forests also host events  organised by local mountain biking and motor sports clubs, for example. The  forest parks provide car-parking facilities and a range of activities,  including graded and way-marked walking trails and family cycle trails.  Furthermore, Castlewellan, Tollymore and Gosford offer pony trekking, camping  and caravanning facilities. There are also scenic drives at Ballypatrick,  Slieve Gullion and Lough Navar.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Forest Service employs a number of forest guides to  facilitate educational trips by schools and other groups. At Castlewellan  Forest Park, the Forest Service has leased  facilities to the Bluelough Adventure Centre &mdash; an outdoors adventure  company that provides a range of activities, including water sports.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to see further development in the social use of  forests, and, in that context, the Forest Service plans to publish a recreation strategy during the next business year, which will set out a policy on recreation  in forests and a framework within which recreation provision can be  taken forward.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her response. Given that the Forest Service appears to  be keen to promote the use of forest parks, can the Minister explain why it has  started to charge mountain-bike clubs &pound;500 a day for running events? Those  charges could wipe out the sport, as clubs cannot afford the fees.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  Forest Service imposes charges in order to  maintain facilities such as paths and toilet blocks. It is hoped that we will  be able to consider charging in the context of the recreation strategy and take  the matter further. If the Member would like, I can come back to her with more  detail about that part of the strategy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Forests need to be used more broadly, and I would like them  to be utilised fully. We are aware of the changing demands for and expectations  of recreation, specifically the requirement to cater for more high-activity  pursuits. The recreation strategy will take account of those demands and  expectations, and we are working with other partnership arrangements on the  matter. Proper maintenance must be provided in order to ensure a safe  environment for the people who use those facilities, and such provision may  result in Forest Service&rsquo;s imposing a cost. As I said, we will consider the  matter carefully, and I can provide the Member with more details.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I have raised the issue of motor-home facilities in our forest parks with the  Minister in the past. I am sure that she is aware that a growing number of motor homes is being registered in  Northern Ireland and that a vast number of people with motor homes  visits Northern Ireland from across the water and elsewhere. I am aware that  the Department is presently reviewing recreational provision, including  facilities for motor homes. Will the Minister state what progress is being made  on that review, and will she give any indication of what its likely conclusions  will be?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  Obviously, we are working through the review. Officials are meeting with  several like-<span style="letter-spacing:-.3pt; ">minded groups in order to  implement its recommendations</span>, but it would probably be pre-emptive to  comment further at this stage. I am happy to come back to the Assembly with the  proposals at a later date when they have been better fleshed out.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  Is the Minister aware that some of the participants in the Department&rsquo;s  forestry scheme have not received their annual payments? If so, can she tell us  roughly when they can expect to receive them?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  The Member knows that that supplementary question does not relate in any way to  the original question; however, I applaud his creativity.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In answer to his question, there have been administrative  difficulties in getting those payments through, and we are hopeful that they  can be made in the not-too-distant future.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Given that I answered the question, I congratulate the  Member for using his imagination.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Rural Childcare</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr  Brolly </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development to detail  the improvements that have been made in relation to rural childcare.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2330/08>(AQO  2330/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. Under the 2001-06 rural development programme, 57  childcare projects received funding, with the result that a total of 170 jobs were created or safeguarded. Some 54  projects were supported under various projects, including Building  Sustainable Prosperity (BSP), LEADER+, Peace II, and Peace II extension  measures, with a total allocation of just over &pound;1&middot;9 million. In addition, three  cross-border projects received funds amounting to &euro;15,000 under Peace II  measure 5.6a. Childcare initiatives will also be eligible for funds under the  new rural development programme for 2007&ndash;13.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, I am conscious that women living in rural areas  still face a barrier to accessing proper childcare. For that reason, I set up a stakeholder group to examine the key  issues that relate to rural childcare provision. That group is chaired by the  chief executive of NIPPA, which is the early  years organisation, and the remainder of  the group is made up of representatives from various organisations with  an interest in, or knowledge of, rural childcare issues.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Importantly, the group also includes representatives from  other relevant Departments, such as OFMDFM and the Department of Education, to  ensure that other relevant strategies are taken into account. The group has  been examining circumstances in rural areas that affect childcare, such as  accessibility and transport difficulties, childcare models that are already  working in rural areas, and the cost of childcare.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">One of the group&rsquo;s most  important emerging findings is the isolation of some rural communities  regarding access to facilities that others take for granted, such as affordable  and accessible childcare, and transport to and  from school for children. I have received the group&rsquo;s draft report, I am  considering its recommendations on how current and future provision can be  improved, and I expect the final report to be available within a few weeks. I  will want to discuss those recommendations with other Departments and with  Executive colleagues to ensure that a  joined-up approach is taken to overcome some of the childcare  difficulties that people in rural areas face. That approach will, in turn, make  a huge difference to families who live in rural areas.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brolly</strong>:  Will the Minister tell us why her Department is responsible for childcare in  rural areas?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  Access to proper childcare facilities is a must for all parents. One of my  roles as Minister of Agriculture and Rural  Development is to be a champion for rural areas and to ensure that rural  dwellers have equitable access to facilities. Rural childcare is also a  priority for me, because it underpins economic and social sustainability in  rural areas. The Rural Stake&shy;holders Forum was established to examine current  rural childcare provision and to suggest possible solutions to highlighted  difficulties.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, childcare is not solely my responsibility. Other  Departments have strategies and actions in place that deal with childcare  issues, but my focus, and the focus of the report and any subsequent DARD  action, is on rural childcare and on ensuring that those in need in rural areas  have the same opportunities that are afforded to those in urban areas. I shall  be working with other Departments that have responsibilities in that area to  ensure that rural issues are included in their policies and strategies, and to ensure that &mdash; collectively &mdash; we  work to improve childcare in rural areas.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her detailed response to the first question. Although  I welcome the figures that she outlined clearly for us, it would seem, from  what she said, that the need for improvements has not been totally met. She is  well aware that one of the priorities of the Executive and Assembly is to  tackle child poverty. The lack of rural childcare is one problem that leads to  child poverty. Has the Minister set aside enough finance to assist rural  childcare opportunities, especially since the Executive have set that priority  but also because need exists?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  DARD has received an allocation of &pound;10 million to tackle poverty and social  exclusion in rural areas over the next CSR period. That will provide us with  the opportunity to work with others inside and outside Government to deal with  a range of issues that affect rural areas, including rural childcare.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I agree that if we enable people to return to work or to get back into training or education, they can  improve their economic status. The two go together, and I am very pleased  that we have &pound;10 million with which to tackle poverty in rural areas. Of  course, we would love to have more, but &pound;10 million well spent will make a real  difference.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McFarland</strong>:  Most of Northern Ireland  is considered to be rural, so will the Minister more clearly define &ldquo;rural  childcare&rdquo;? Can she tell us which children qualify as being &ldquo;rural&rdquo;?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  Has the Member got all day? A great deal is contained in that question. Four  out of 10 people live in rural areas. That figure means that four out of 10  children also live in rural areas. For children who live near towns, where  there is a critical mass, childcare facilities can be made available where  there are enough children to make them worthwhile. Difficulties in rural areas  include isolation, lack of registered childminders, and people not having  access to childcare voucher schemes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although I have the draft report only at this stage, it  contains a number of recommendations on how to tackle rural childcare. People who live in Derrygonnelly, Aghyarn or Rathfriland need access to quality,  affordable childcare. Discussions  are ongoing with the Department for  Social Development, which believes that populations under 4,500 are defined as rural. That accounts  for a significant section of the population. An emphasis must be placed on  rural issues and on how we facilitate services, and service providers, in rural  areas to ensure that people have the same access to services as those who live  in towns.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Reducing Bureaucracy</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mrs  McGill </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development to give a  timescale within which the group, established by her Department and the  Department of the Environment to reduce bureaucracy, will report; and to detail  any progress to date.&nbsp; <a name=AQO2362/08>(AQO 2362/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. The review panel, as a result of a number of meetings that  it has held with stakeholders and departmental officials, now has a measure of  its task. A questionnaire has been issued to stakeholders that seeks evidence  of over-regulation and their assessment of which regulations that DARD and the  Department of the Environment are placing on the agrifood industry are  unnecessarily burdensome. Once the responses to the questionnaire have been  analysed, the review panel proposes to conduct workshops &mdash; bringing together  stakeholders, policy-makers and inspectors &mdash; to explore the issues raised and  to identify where there is scope to reduce the administrative burden on the  industry. Those workshops will be conducted at the beginning of April.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The panel anticipates that it will be able to complete that  stage of the work by the end of May 2008 and will spend June drafting its final  report, which it expects to publish by the middle of July 2008. As I told the  House previously, the targets that have been set are 25% by 2013 and an interim  target of 15% by 2011.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Given that 2011 and 2013 are a long  way off, what is the Minister doing in the short term to reduce red tape and  bureaucracy? Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  The review will result in a plan that will make recommendations for the  simplification of administrative processes, aimed at maintaining policy  effectiveness and public accountability and identifying areas where the  associated administrative burdens can be reduced. The Department of Agriculture  and Rural Development and the Department of the Environment will then develop  action plans to implement the recommendations outlined in the simplification  plan. I anticipate that some recommendations can be implemented reasonably  quickly but that others will take longer. Every effort will be made to deliver  the benefits as quickly as possible, and farmers will see the benefits long  before 2013.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  Why has it taken the Minister so long to identify bureaucracy savings in her  Department when overstaffing and bureaucratic inefficiency is so apparent? Does  the Minister really believe that it is not possible to identify savings in a  system that needs up to nine officials, and takes nine months, to process a  single farm payment application?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  The Member will agree that farmers find it difficult to deal with the fact that  many of the Department&rsquo;s regulations come from Europe.  The Department needs to consider how it can reduce bureaucracy and the  administrative burden on farmers, and it is discussing ways to achieve that  with EU officials. One of the first things that the Department did as a result  of the Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union&rsquo;s (UFU) Cut it  Out campaign was to address bureaucracy. Although the Department took some time  to agree the composition of the panel with the Department of the Environment,  it is now working, and we will soon see positive results. However, we cannot  solve all problems immediately.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>:  The reduction of paperwork is one of the five basic recommendations outlined in  the UFU&rsquo;s &lsquo;Five Steps to a Better Future&rsquo; to cut down on red tape in the  farming industry. Can the Minister tell us how many of the five recommendations  she has implemented to date?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  Work on four of the five recommendations is ongoing, and they are works in  progress. I examined, and consulted widely on, the Agricultural Wages Board,  and I decided that I would not progress that recommendation.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Communications Courses at &nbsp;Loughry   College and <br>
	        Students  Studying &nbsp;at Agricultural Colleges</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mrs  O&rsquo;Neill </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development to detail  the reasons for her Department&rsquo;s plans to withdraw the Master of Science  communications course at Loughry College; and what plans it has to hold  discussions with the Department for Employment and Learning in order to retain  this course in the Cookstown/Tyrone area.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2365/08>(AQO  2365/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">6. <strong>Mr  Bresland </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development to outline  the number of full-time students who are currently studying at agricultural  colleges.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 2260/08)</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">13. <strong>Mr I  McCrea </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development to detail  the reasons for ending all undergraduate and postgraduate communications courses  at Loughry College.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  2360/08)</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  With your permission, Mr Speaker, I will take questions 5, 6 and 13 together.  To put the issue in context and in response to question 6, the College of Agriculture, Food and Rural Enterprise  (CAFRE) enrolled 1,561 students in October 2007 across its three campuses at  Enniskillen, Loughry and Greenmount. Of those students, 641 are full-time and  920 are part-time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In response to questions 5 and 13, no decision has been  taken to end any of CAFRE&rsquo;s courses. A proposal has been made to withdraw the  undergraduate and postgraduate communications courses at the Loughry campus.  That proposal reflects the budgetary pressures that my Department and other  Departments face under the new Programme for Government. The proposal to cease  the communications courses has raised several queries from Members as well as  CAFRE students. I have received an invitation to meet students, and I hope to  do so on Wednesday 5 March. My officials attended  a Committee for Agriculture and Rural Develop&shy;ment meeting to discuss  the issue, and I subsequently asked them to consult the key stakeholders. I  will take on board the views of CAFRE students and other key stakeholders in  making my decision.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Over the next year, my Department will be implementing an  ambitious work programme, which will include the roll-out of the new rural  development programme and a series of anti-poverty measures. All of that must  take place on top of our existing workload, and, at the same time, we must  accommodate major efficiency savings of &pound;6 million, &pound;12 million and &pound;18 million  across the next three years. Although the future of the communication course  programmes might not lie in DARD given the current priorities, I have written  to the Minister for Employment and Learning, Sir Reg Empey, to seek a meeting  with him as they might fit better in the mainstream provision that is provided  by the Department for Employment and Learning.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. I welcome the fact that the Minister has plans to meet  with students in the coming week. If the decision were taken to withdraw the  communication course programmes, where would that leave Loughrey College?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  Loughrey campus will continue to offer a range of education and training  programmes focused on meeting the needs of the local food industry. Graduates  from the campus have good employment prospects and I encourage any young person  who is interested in a career in the food industry to consider Loughrey as  their place of study. The Member and I live quite close to Loughrey and we know  the type of work that the college does. Loughrey&rsquo;s position in mid-Ulster is no  coincidence: there are many high-profile food companies in the area, and  Loughrey provides a range of well-trained graduates who are eminently capable  of working in the industry. Loughrey is a huge benefit to the Department and I  have every confidence in the college.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bresland</strong>:  There is considerable concern in the farming community about the future of the  agricultural colleges. Will the Minister confirm whether her Department has a  long-term strategy for the provision of full-time agriculture courses in Northern Ireland?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  Absolutely: yes. Agriculture courses, particularly the third-level education  element, should be in my Department&rsquo;s remit. We have an unshakeable commitment  to deliver courses that will help to support our agrifood and agriculture  industries.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  I am concerned that the communication course programmes are being removed from  the Loughrey campus, especially as the college has helped to fashion a  generation of agrifood leaders and advisers in the agriculture industry. We  would have been better served had the Minister first consulted the local  community on whether the course needed to close, rather than act first and talk  later.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Will the Member ask his question?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  Given that the Minister is going to meet the students, will she give an  assurance that she will consider their views and, if need be, reinstate the  course?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  First, the decision on the course has not yet been taken. To implement the  ambitious programme of work that is planned  for my Department, which includes the  &lsquo;Northern Ireland  Rural Development Programme  2007-2013&rsquo;, significant planning is required, and on that my officials  are engaged. Discussions on the proposal to withdraw the communication course  programmes are ongoing, including with the trade union side. Officials met the  Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development, and I have asked them to  consult widely with key stakeholders. I am meeting students later in the week.  Firm decisions will be taken only when their full implications have been assessed, including consideration of equality  implications. If &mdash; and at this stage it is an &ldquo;if&rdquo; &mdash; the proposals are adopted, anyone at present on a communications  course will be finishing their study. This is not something that is  happening today, or next week, or next month. We are looking at the issue but  everyone who is on that course will get the chance to finish it.</p>

	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Navigational Authority on Lough Neagh</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr I  McCrea </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure whether or not  consideration is being given to establishing a navigational authority on Lough  Neagh.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2265/08>(AQO 2265/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure (Mr Poots)</strong>: My Department is finalising the terms  of reference for commissioning an economic appraisal to assess the viability of  establishing some form of navigation authority on Lough Neagh and the rivers  Blackwater and Upper Bann.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  Obviously this issue has huge potential for recreation and tourism.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">What is the estimated  cost of establishing a navigation authority for Lough Neagh?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: A  feasibility study in 2004 envisaged a cost of &pound;13&middot;2 million for a two-stage  development plan to establish a navigation authority. In addition, there would  have been an annual maintenance cost of &pound;776,000. Subsequently, a number of  capital infra&shy;structure projects or  commitments, primarily sponsored by local authorities, Lough Neagh  Partnership and DCAL, have significantly reduced those proposed costs. Examples  of such projects include the provision of a replacement navigable bridge at  Maghery Cut and improved jetty moorings at Kinnego, Ballyronan, Sandy Bay,  Cranfield, Ram&rsquo;s Island and Antrim. Until an  economic appraisal is carried out, I cannot say what the revised cost will be.  However, ISNI II includes provision of &pound;11&middot;7 million in year 6 for this  purpose.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>: My question has already been answered.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  Has the Minister taken any action to acquire ownership of the bed of Lough  Neagh from the Shaftesbury estate, and will he consider the possibility of  creating a Lough Neagh authority, charged with the development of the tourist  and business potential of the lough and its surrounding region?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: No  action has been taken to acquire the bed of Lough Neagh.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Titanic Quarter</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr  Neeson </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure to detail his plans  for the future of the Titanic Quarter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO2295/08> (AQO  2295/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: The Titanic Quarter belongs to the Belfast Harbour  Commissioners; any plans for the future of the  area would in the first instance be a matter for them.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his very brief answer. He is well aware of my interest  in maritime heritage, which I have previously declared in this House. Will the  Minister tell me, and the House, whether he is satisfied with the involvement  of DCAL in the development of the Titanic signature project? Secondly, as the  Minister knows, there is no Department in Northern Ireland with  responsibility for maritime heritage as such. Can he assure me that he and his  colleagues will try to resolve this matter as soon as possible?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  The Titanic signature project is being led by DETI and is the responsibility of  that Department.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have consulted the Northern Ireland Museums Council with a view to what could potentially be  achieved with regard to the maritime  heritage of Northern Ireland.  Maritime heritage is something that is  synonymous with Northern Ireland. It stretches as far back as the plantation  of Ulster &mdash; much of the purpose of which  was to produce timber to make ships &mdash; and the early Presbyterians, who  left from the Ulster Scots areas to travel to the United States and make that country what it has become, right  through to the building of the Titanic and the role of Northern Ireland in the First and Second World Wars. There is  a huge maritime history in Northern    Ireland that we have failed to reflect, and  that is something that I should like to see changed in the future.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that the industrial heritage of Northern Ireland,  including the linen, shipbuilding,  rope-making and aircraft industries, and the stories of the people  involved, are worth preserving? Has he any plans to create museums or display  facilities in the Titanic Quarter in association with the site owners?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  recently attended an exhibition on the building of the Titanic at W5, and I  recommend it. It includes some excellent photographs of the people who were  involved in the building of that great ship. In 2002-03, National Museums  and Galleries of Northern Ireland commissioned a feasibility study on the  development of a &ldquo;museum of sea and sky&rdquo; in the Titanic Quarter. Discussions  have taken place with National Museums on the possibility of revisiting its  proposals for the interpretation of Belfast&rsquo;s  maritime and industrial heritage in the context of the current plans for the  regeneration of the Titanic Quarter.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I agree with Mr Neeson that there is great value in maritime heritage; it is  something that we should be very proud of.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Given the high level of  public and private investment, there is a unique opportunity for the  encouragement of public art in the Titanic Quarter &mdash; it would add tremendously  to the overall development of that area. Does the Minister have any plans for  the promotion of public art?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  have held early exploratory talks about public art with people from the  development sector of the business community. It has been suggested that when a significant development is undertaken,  developers should contribute 1% of the cost of that development to  public art in the area. I do not believe that there is a statutory means of  enforcing such a scheme, but we will discuss further the possibility of  implementing it on a voluntary basis.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Community Festivals Fund</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr  Moutray </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure to detail the  discussions he has had with local councils regarding the future delivery of the  community festivals fund.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2298/08>(AQO  2298/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">18. <strong>Ms N&iacute;  Chuil&iacute;n </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure to outline the  nature of responses his Department received from local councils in relation to  the funding of festivals.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2359/08>(AQO  2359/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  With permission, Mr Speaker, I shall answer question 3 and question 18  together. Following my statement on 4 December 2007, departmental officials  wrote to the chief executive of each local council to outline plans to transfer  the administration of the community festivals fund to those councils from 1 April 2008. Since then, my officials have been  working closely with the Northern Ireland Local Government Association  to facilitate that transfer. The responses received to date &mdash; from a number of  councils &mdash; indicate broad support for the new arrangements. Belfast City  Council has sought further clarification and information on various elements of  the plan.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Moutray</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his response. Applications to the community festivals  fund from the Orange  and unionist community have been under-represented in the past. Therefore, will  the Minister encourage local councils to proactively engage with individuals  and groups from a unionist background to ensure greater fairness?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Absolutely. In the last round of funding, approximately  &pound;450,000 was available to be distributed. Of that sum, only &pound;40,000 was  claimed by people from a unionist-identity  group. That was clearly dissatisfactory. That issue must be addressed &mdash;  and I trust it will be &mdash; by local authorities when they are allocating funds to  the various groups this time around.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Does the Minister acknowledge that not  every local council, including Belfast City Council, is happy with the  proposals? Will he also admit that local festivals, particularly community  festivals, increasingly have to rely on private funding?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  The indications are that the vast majority of councils are satisfied to proceed  with the proposals. Funding for local community festivals has not been reduced,  so the reliance on private sources should not be any greater. Community  festivals that have worked well in the past should be better able to attract  private-sector funding, therefore allowing other community festivals to thrive.  Indeed, the system that we have introduced will double the amount of money  allocated to the community festival fund, since it is to be match-funded by the  councils.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member apparently claims that Belfast City Council does  not support the idea because they do not want to match-fund the Government  grant, but I am not sure that that is true. The new arrangement means that more  money &mdash; not less &mdash; will be provided for community festivals.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>: Will the Minister indicate how much has been spent in the last  three years on the community festivals fund? What audit has been carried out on  the expenditure of those funds, in respect of both value for money and  measurable impact?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  cannot tell the Member the spending for three years because the system has only  been in operation for two. The expenditure on the community festivals fund has  been &pound;450,000 per annum for the last two years.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that community festivals have been dramatically  beneficial in reducing conflict and antisocial behaviour? Can he say what  moneys are available from the central Government to support community  festivals?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  have allocated &pound;450,000 of central Government money to local authorities for  distribution to community festivals through match-funding mechanisms. In addition, groups such as the Arts  Council might sponsor events that enhance the arts, and other areas that  are the responsibility of other Departments might  be offered funding. Nevertheless, money is clearly coming from central Government to community  festivals.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Capital Stadium Development &nbsp;for Football Clubs</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mrs D  Kelly </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure to outline the money  available for capital stadium development for football clubs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2315/08>(AQO  2315/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  With permission, Mr Speaker, I will deal with questions 4, 16 and 20 together.  The recently announced capital budget for sport is &pound;31&middot;2 million for 2008-09,  &pound;36&middot;4 million for 2009-2010, and &pound;44 million for  2010-11. Sport NI is responsible for the development of sport, including  the distribution of funding, and is currently  considering how those funds might be allocated throughout sport. As part  of that process, Sport NI is working closely with sports&rsquo; governing bodies &mdash;  including those from soccer, rugby and Gaelic games &mdash; on stadium-development  needs. When that process is completed, Sport NI will take decisions about  grants for stadium development, including maximum grants.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">From its budget this year, Sport NI has introduced several  capital-grant programmes &mdash; such as stadia safety,  Gaelic-games modernisation and soccer-strategy programmes &mdash; that are  designed to assist rugby, Gaelic games and soccer in developing their stadia.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his response. He referred to stadium safety, but there  is a belief that there is a shortfall in the budget for stadium-safety work.  Will the Minister outline the likely impact of health and safety rules on  stadium capacity in Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s various sports venues?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  When the new rules are introduced, stadia will have to close if measures are  not taken to improve them. Therefore, in the coming years, without significant  upgrades, certain stadia will come under a lot of pressure. Money, which will,  hopefully, offset some of those pressures, will go to various sports in order  to enhance the stadia that currently exist.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>:  What measures has the Minister put in place to encourage grant uptake? Does the  Minister have a plan to ensure that every penny of that money is allocated to  sports clubs that need it, and what will he do with any money that is not  distributed this year?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Sport NI is responsible for the distribution of such funding, significant funds  have already been distributed, and the IFA&rsquo;s recent decision will ensure that  that continues to be the case.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>:  Given that the IFA has reduced its executive board from 18 to 11 members; will  the remaining &pound;4 million be allocated to it?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Yes. We can now move ahead and release the soccer-strategy money. There are  some minor issues, but they will be quickly  resolved and, thereafter, that money  will be on the ground as quickly as possible.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Is there any prospect of additional  moneys being secured to allow Sport NI to open up a new round of sports  capital-funding applications from community-level clubs? People in  constituencies are telling us that they want to develop boxing or football clubs, but there is still a freeze on applications  for sports capital grants? Has the  Minister considered that matter?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: We  recently discovered that we are able to use  Exchequer funding in order to support applications that would previously  have been supported by lottery funding. In the new year, when we consider  sports spending, depending on the available resources, that is something to  which we will give consideration.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>: In light of Minister of the Environment&rsquo;s stated preference for small rural communities or  clachans consisting of about 14  houses, will the Minister indicate whether the provision of 2,500 houses  as the price of building a stadium at the Maze is acceptable?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  am not sure where Mr Kennedy is coming from.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Should he repeat the question, Mr Speaker?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  do not need the question repeated. The site that was being talked about was  identified as a strategic development site; not the crossroads develop&shy;ment  that Mr Kennedy may be referring to.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Ministerial Meetings with Republic of Ireland  Counterpart</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr  McCarthy </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure to outline the  meetings he has held with his counterpart in the Republic of Ireland.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2287/08>(AQO 2287/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  attended two NSMC sectoral meetings with &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cuiv, the Minister for  Community, Rural and Gaeltacht affairs. Those were the NMSC language sectoral  meeting of 26 October 2007 that was held in Altnaveigh House in Newry, and the  NSMC inland waterways sectoral meeting of 17 October 2007 that was held in the  Slieve Russell Hotel Golf and Country Club in Cavan.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On a visit to Dublin  on 28 November 2007, I had separate meetings with &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cuiv and S&eacute;amus  Brennan, the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism, at which I was accompanied  by the British Ambassador. I also met them both at the two NSMC plenary  meetings, which took place on 17 July 2007 in the Armagh City Hotel and on 7  February 2008 in the Dundalk Institute of Technology.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer. He is obviously very busy in that regard.  Given that the Minister&rsquo;s counterpart in the South has contributed to cultural  associations in Northern Ireland,  will the Minister try to close the gap in the disparity of funding for arts in Northern Ireland  compared to that in the South of Ireland?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  The Member may not realise it, but the Budget signalled for the first time that  that gap was beginning to close. Work is being done on that issue. The gap on  spending on the arts in Northern Ireland  compared to the rest of the UK  is also beginning to close as a consequence of the Budget.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Browne</strong>:  During the meeting with his counterpart in the Republic  of Ireland, did the Minister express  the deep anger that is felt by the majority of Northern   Ireland soccer fans regarding the Football Association of  Ireland&rsquo;s claim on players who were born in this part of the United Kingdom?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  That particular issue was not being driven by the Minister for Arts, Sports and  Tourism; it was the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dermot Ahern, who had been  pushing it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Football bodies have made it clear that they do not want  political interference in football, which is the appropriate line to take. I  urge my counterparts in the Irish   Republic, or elsewhere,  to allow the football authorities to devise their own strategies on that issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The current rules are clear: a person can play only for the  country that they, their parents or their grandparents were born in. Therefore,  a person who was born in Northern Ireland  and whose parents and grandparents were born in Northern   Ireland should be playing football for Northern Ireland  and no other country.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  Has the Minister raised the possibility of additional funding from the Irish  Exchequer for joint centres of excellence for the Olympic Games, or for any  other sports facilities or services that can be shared on a cross-border basis?  That includes the judo centre of excellence and the Derry City Football Club  centre of excellence.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  am well aware that the Member&rsquo;s colleague Mr Ramsey has paid at least one visit  to Dublin to  discuss the future of a new stadium at the Brandywell. I have discussed that  issue with S&eacute;amus Brennan.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If the Government of the Republic of Ireland Government  want to contribute to a club that plays in the Football Association of  Ireland&rsquo;s league, that is a matter for them.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brolly</strong>:  Ceist uimhir a s&eacute;.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I call the Minister.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  was waiting for the English translation.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brolly</strong>:  Question No 6.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Employment Opportunites for Local Actors</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">6. <strong>Mr  Brolly </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure to outline his  Department&rsquo;s plans to provide full-time employment opportunities for local  actors.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2344/08>(AQO 2344/08</a>)</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  DCAL does not have a direct role in providing employment for actors, but  support is provided through the Arts Council of Northern Ireland and Northern  Ireland Screen. Local actors may apply to the Arts Council for support for  individual artist programmes. The council offers grants of up to &pound;5,000 for  project assistance, travel grants and residencies, and so on. The Arts Council  also supports local theatre companies and venues through revenue and project  grants and has made drama an art-form priority in its current strategic plan.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Northern Ireland Screen encourages the use of local actors  in the productions that it supports. Recent films such as &lsquo;Closing the Ring&rsquo; and  &lsquo;Middletown&rsquo;  and Irish-language drama &lsquo;Seacht&rsquo; all had a large cast of local actors. The  Department for Employment and Learning has advised that it does not tailor its  programmes and services to any particular sector, such as the acting  profession. Its services are used by a wide range of jobseekers and employers  alike. Those services include a job centre and an online facility through which  employers advertise their vacancies and jobseekers identify potential job  opportunities.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brolly</strong>:  In view of the fact that actors, like boxers, tend to come up through the  amateur ranks, is the Minister disappointed that the Arts Council has told us  that it does not have a full and exhaustive list of amateur drama groups?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Some would say that there is a fair bit of support going to actors already &mdash;  there are 108 MLAs here, and a few of them would perhaps fall into that  category. Perhaps I hear some of them trying to get in on the act here right  now.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The numbers involved in amateur dramatics are such that it  would be exceedingly difficulty for the Arts Council to garner them all  together.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Does the Minister share my view that an insufficient amount of locally produced  drama is being broadcast on the BBC and other channels? What is being done to  increase the amount of such drama from Northern Ireland?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: It  has been somewhat disappointing that, in spite of the fact that we have made  great progress in the film industry, the BBC and ITV have not made the same investment. In fact, part of the BBC charter  would indicate that a greater  investment should be made in the regions.  People perceive that dramas such as &lsquo;Murphy&rsquo;s Law&rsquo; are made in Belfast, yet the only  thing that relates to Northern Ireland  in &lsquo;Murphy&rsquo;s Law&rsquo; is Jimmy Nesbitt. Clearly the BBC has a role to play;  we have raised the issue of the resources  that should be put into the industry in Northern Ireland with the BBC at a  local level, and we will also raise it at a national level with its director  general Mark Thompson.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert  Coulter</strong>: I thank the Minister for his answers. In 2006, cultural tourism  contributed &pound;324 million to Belfast&rsquo;s  economy, an increase of 14% on the previous  year. That supports nearly 16,000 full-time jobs and has triggered over  &pound;300 million of investment with additional  hotels, restaurants and venues. Scotland  also sees that the arts are big business.  Does the Minister appreciate that connection, and does he understand  that one has to invest to accumulate? What portion of the Minister&rsquo;s budget is  spent on drama and art in schools?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  The Member raises an interesting point about how the arts help the economy,  and, in particular, the economy of our capital city. He raised this matter at a  very relevant time &mdash; one would nearly think I had primed this question because  the Department has set aside a considerable amount of money for the develop&shy;ment  of the metropolitan arts centre. The centre will cost about &pound;17 million, and  just under &pound;3 million has currently been raised. A request has been placed with  Belfast City Council for support for that venue. Given the figures that Dr  Coulter has outlined, I would like to believe that a very large cheque from  Belfast City Council will be coming our way to ensure that work on that venue  proceeds.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Mr Burnside, who is next on the list to ask a question, is not in the Chamber.  Questions No 8, 9 and 10 have been withdrawn. Mr Ford does not wish to publish  question 11.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Eel Fishing in Lough Neagh</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">12. <strong>Mr W  Clarke </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts  and Leisure to confirm whether he will meet directly with the Lough  Neagh Fishermen&rsquo;s Co-operative in order to discuss the needs of the eel-fishing  industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO2339/08> (AQO 2339/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I shall visit the Lough Neagh Fishermen&rsquo;s Co-operative in the  near future to discuss the eel-fishing industry&rsquo;s needs.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.  Given the shortage of elvers in Lough Neagh, is the Minister concerned  for the eel-fishing industry?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  The co-operative buys a considerable number of elvers each year for Lough  Neagh, and its members are pressing the Department for greater financial  support towards the cost. Later this year, I shall meet co-operative members to  discuss the matter further. I shall investigate whether there is a way in which  to assist the co-operative, and I want to see what its members do for  themselves. I shall assess whether those who benefit from eel fishing in Lough  Neagh are reinvesting sufficient resources.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Mr Simpson and Mr O&rsquo;Dowd are not in the Chamber, so we move on to question 15.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Northern    Ireland Football</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">15. <strong>Mr  Shannon </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure what consideration he has given to marking the  fiftieth anniversary of the Northern Ireland World Cup football team; and to recognising the heroic actions of Mr Harry  Gregg during the Munich  disaster. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2281/08>(AQO 2281/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: As  all Members know, Harry Gregg is a former member of the Northern Ireland  football team, and, during an outstanding career, he played in goal for  Manchester United from 1957 to 1967. Harry pulled some of his Manchester United  teammates, including Bobby Charlton, Jackie Blanchflower and Dennis Viollet,  from a burning plane during the Munich  air disaster in 1958. Harry received the MBE in 1995, and I am sure that the Assembly  will join me in praising his heroic actions and in recognising his outstanding  contribution to football and to Northern    Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I intend to host a  reception for the surviving members of the 1958 Northern Ireland World  Cup football team, including Harry Gregg, as soon as that can be arranged.  Officials in my Department are making the necessary arrangements.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his warm and positive reply, which demonstrates that  the Assembly is responsive to public opinion. I also congratulate the Minister  on reaching question 15, which is probably a record for the Chamber. I just  happened to be present for my question.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: It  does not look as though the Minister will get to question 16. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  He definitely will not. Does the Minister agree that the 1958 World Cup team  marked the start of a positive era for Northern Ireland football? To  invite the team, including Billy Bingham, to the Assembly would make for a  special event.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is often said that the term &ldquo;hero&rdquo; is overused, but Harry Gregg is a hero to many people in Northern Ireland.  He saved many lives on that afternoon in Munich,  and it would be good not only to recognise his heroism but to present him with  a gift, if that were in order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  thank the Member for his question. The 1958 football team made a significant  contribution to Northern    Ireland. It also paved the way for the  success of the Northern    Ireland teams that reached the World Cup  finals of 1982 and 1986. I want to pay tribute to the 1958 team while its  players are still around &mdash; I understand that seven or eight of the team are  still alive. I want to arrange a significant event to recognise them and their  heroics during that World Cup, and to pay particular tribute to Harry Gregg,  who demonstrated extreme bravery during the Munich air disaster and great humility in its  aftermath.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Neither Trevor Lunn nor Pat Ramsey is in the Chamber, so that ends questions to  the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. The first questions today were to the Office  of the First Minister and deputy First Minister. Under the terms of the Good  Friday Agreement and the St Andrews  legislation, the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister is a  joint office. Will you clarify that that is the case? Further to that, will you  examine the answers to the questions on the date for the devolution of policing  and justice and on the definition of victims? Did the answers given reflect the  view of both the First Minister and the deputy First Minister?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I take the Member&rsquo;s point, but that is not a matter for the Speaker. Everyone  in the House should know that OFMDFM is a joint office.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is all that I can say to the Member. The  Speaker is certainly not responsible for anything beyond that.</p>

	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="7"></a>Executive Committee Business</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Rates (Industrial Hereditaments) (Amendment) Order (Northern Ireland) 2008</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Debate resumed on motion:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly approves the Rates (Industrial  Hereditaments) (Amendment) Order (Northern Ireland) 2008.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Speaker, for the opportunity to conclude my remarks. I will avoid  the temptation to repeat my earlier comments for the benefit of those who  missed them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I was stressing, the key issue with regard to business  taxation must be the pursuit of a differential rate of corporation tax. I am  disappointed that the Executive seem to have given up the fight and that the  Assembly has not received a statement from the Minister or any of his colleagues  that sets out the Executive&rsquo;s response to the Varney Review and how matters are  to be taken forward. A lot may be happening behind the scenes. However, it is  important that the Assembly have the opportunity to question Ministers and to  pass judgement on those issues. It is also important that the Assembly consider  how industrial derating will play a role in the future regional economic  strategy and what effect it will have on the Varney Review II, which is well  under way.</p>
	      <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have reflected long and hard on the position that I have  articulated with respect to industrial derating. I appreciate that there have  been quite a few Assembly debates on the issue. I have paid particular  attention to the ERINI report. It is a substantive piece of work to which the  Assembly must give proper consideration and due regard. Any journey that the  Alliance Party may have made on the issue pales into insignificance compared  with the journeys that several parties have made in recent years. The Alliance  Party accepts ERINI&rsquo;s recommendation to set industrial rating at 50% rather  than the 30% that is proposed by this statutory rule. I will conclude by  putting on the record some comments from the ERINI report:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Industrial derating is important because rates are  now a full part of the resources available to the Executive. Derating,  therefore, has a genuine opportunity cost in terms of public services foregone  &hellip; There is little evidence that rates would cause a collapse in manufacturing  with substantial loss of output and jobs beyond existing trends in the sector.  Nor is there much of an argument to support returning derating as a means of  attracting new investment &hellip; Based on the analysis undertaken by ERINI the  Executive has a range of choices over the degree of further implementation it  undertakes. Given the quality of information available to analyse this issue  ERINI suggest proceeding cautiously. At 50% implementation no more than an  estimated 10% of companies are likely to face rate bills much more than 15% of  their profits. Proceeding to this point would incur a relatively small risk to  industry as a whole &hellip; Proceeding no further than this degree of implementation  is the position we favour.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Alliance Party concurs with ERINI that setting  industrial rating at 50% is the cautious approach to take. Although Members may  believe that moving it from 30% to 50% is risky, I caution them that the  Assembly faces the biggest risk of all if it does not seek to modernise and  rebalance the economy.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  The Member has talked extensively about ERINI&rsquo;s analysis. How does he feel  about the DTZ Pieda report that has  informed previous Assembly debates? It says that the imposition of  industrial rates would have a negligible  effect. At the time, did he believe that report to be flawed? There  seems to be some contradiction.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Has he also considered  &lsquo;The Future of Manufacturing in Northern Ireland&rsquo;, prepared for the  Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment by Pricewaterhouse&shy;Coopers,  which forecasts 40,000 job losses if there is no investment in the  manufacturing sector? Has he considered any research over and above that single  ERINI report?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  The reports to which the Member refers deal with manufacturing in general,  rather than the specific issue of industrial derating. It is important that the  Assembly avoid mixing analyses in its discussion. Clearly, there is a problem  in manufacturing.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, there is also a need to invest across the economy.  It is more efficient and effective to invest the revenue that would be gained  from moving to 50% rating in the drivers of our economy, which would provide  benefit across the spectrum &mdash; the service sector, the manufacturing sector and  all other sectors. That would be a better  way to improve our productivity and economy, maintain full employment  and become a prosperous and sustainable region within the United Kingdom.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>: I support the Minister in his endeavours. Although the Order is rather short and is being  introduced in a relatively low-key manner, it is vitally important to  the well-being of the various sectors of our industry.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Unlike Dr Farry, I have spent my life either working in industry; working in an advisory capacity to  industry, or working as a consultant &mdash; particularly to the manufacturing  industry. The Order is particularly vital to the well-being of the  manufacturing sector, the 90,000 employees in that sector &mdash; which was the  figure the last time I checked &mdash; and the prosperity of that sector and the  Northern Ireland economy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members are aware of the high-profile campaign that was mounted by the Northern Ireland  Manufacturing Focus Group (NIMFG), which comprises people who do not  come together unless they feel that their backs are against the wall. In his remarks, the Minister quoted how  industrialists would feel if there were 100% rates. It was stated that the  result would be the potential for reduced investment in plants, job losses, and  that, if there were 100% rates, moving  across the border would be a more attractive option.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My experience of industrialists is that they are men and  women who say what they mean and mean what they say. When they come together to  speak with one voice in a campaign, they must be listened to because they mean  what they say. They do not embark on such campaigns lightly &mdash; they embark on  them because they believe in the position that they have taken. The NIMFG  campaign involved employees from the smallest to the largest employers in Northern Ireland  and were from across the manufacturing industry.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It has already been stated that the removal of industrial  rating dates back to 1929. It was a helpful tool for the various Ministers of  the economy in Northern Ireland  when they were embarking on trips to attract  industry to Northern Ireland.  There were precious few tools in their toolbox to help attract  industrialists to Northern    Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It certainly was of  help and value in the development of indigenous manufacturing  organisations. Businesses find starting up difficult, and the incentive of  having no rates to pay is invaluable.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In April 2003, direct rule Ministers announced the phasing  out that benefit. That announcement was met with absolute horror by the  manufacturing sector, which would have been due to start paying those full  rates by April 2001 had there not been a devolved Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members have already said that the manufacturing sector is  under pressure in various areas &mdash; it is contending with increasing energy  costs, additional costs in the transport of goods, and it daily faces  minimum-wage levels from manufacturers in the Far East.  Dr Farry referred to the textiles sector. There are probably fewer than 5,000 people working in that sector today, as  opposed to around 25,000 people five or six years ago. Industrial derating was  not the only contri&shy;buting factor, but it was a factor, and continues to be.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the fact that the Minister has said that he will  hold the industrial rating level at 30%. When this issue was debated in the  House, the Gallery was almost full of people with a vested interest in the  matter, who wanted to hear the Assembly&rsquo;s views. The decision to hold the rate  at 30% will allow industrialists to set their budgets, and to plan and  determine their investments until 2011. There are few ways in which we can  directly support the sector, but that is one way.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Rates (Industrial Hereditaments) (Amendment) Order (Northern Ireland)  2008 supports the Assembly&rsquo;s Programme for Government, which identifies  economic growth as a priority. It sends out the clear message that we value  those who are prepared to get their hands dirty, work and invest in the  manufacturing sector, and those who are prepared to risk investing their money  and employing staff.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Order also sends out a message to those who are  employed in the manufacturing sector that the Assembly is prepared to do what  it can to ensure that the maintenance of the declining numbers will be  arrested, and that there may be some growth.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Dr Farry&rsquo;s attitude reminds me of the story of the parents  who went to watch their son as he marched in a parade, and noticed that  everyone was out of step except their little boy. A different system may be developed, and certainly could be developed, to  support industry. However, we are where we are. Employers said that  there was the potential to lose industrial jobs if we did not arrest the rate  at 30%. In the longer term, we may be able to arrive at a different system, but  the matter needed to be addressed in a practical manner.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The naysayers of the Assembly, and those who argue that  they would prefer direct rule to continue rather than to have the Assembly in  its present format, need to talk to the manufacturing sector and the business  community about such matters.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The business sector and those who are employed therein have  a great appreciation of that particular matter as well as of other activities.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  At the outset, I wish to declare an interest. I have previously informed the  House of my association with the Northern Ireland Manufacturing Group. That has been noted in the Register of  Members&rsquo; Interests, although I am no  longer connected to the group.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I was not going to speak on this topic because:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Success has many fathers, but failure is an orphan&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">However, rarely have I heard such hypocrisy and  cant from those in the Benches to my right. That is opposition for opposition&rsquo;s  sake. It is based on spurious arguments, weak analyses and poor research.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">&ldquo;Cant&rdquo; is the operative word, because that is all I can  hear &mdash; &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do this, that, or the other.&rdquo; Time and again we are lectured  and told that it is time for the Assembly to start to deal with the things over  which it has control. Dealing with  industrial rating is a significant step forward.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As Members will know, I have been involved with that issue  for a considerable time. I have tried to explain it to all concerned, but it  appears that I have failed to explain it to Dr Farry. I stand to be corrected,  but I note that he did not attend any of the council briefings; he did not join  us at the Waterfront Hall; and he did not visit any firms&rsquo; premises to find out  anything about the situation. I have some nice photographs of a Northern  Ireland Manufacturing Group event at the Waterfront Hall that Mr Hamilton will  recognise, because he was there.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  We were there too.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>: Yes. A few Strangford Members were there, but not Mr McCarthy.  Perhaps he knows a lot about the value of property and does not need to go to such events &mdash; at least, not to events about  office space.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Neeson stood up in front of nearly 2,000 people at the  Waterfront Hall and said:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;We are calling for industrial rates payments to be  capped at 25%, where they are now, so that we can be clear about precisely what  effect they have on investment and start-ups.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Alliance Party has clearly undertaken some sort  of voyage of exploration.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Let me make the case simple. We live and work in a global  environment. Every year manufacturing costs increase, whether for transport,  engineering or labour. However, our ability to pass on costs is negligible,  because we operate in a global market. The only way in which we can compete is  through constant innovation and investment. That is the real problem. Dr Farry  talks about rates affecting only 15% of profits. However, that 15% is used to  make investment. Without investment, firms have no long-term future.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members have suggested &mdash; although I have not risen to  the bait before &mdash; that industrial derating is a blunt instrument. Whether that  is the case, the analysis of the figures shows that 80% of the industrial rates  are paid by 20% of the companies. Our biggest and best companies, which employ  the most people, are carrying the burden. It is not difficult to imagine that  the intervention will be effective.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It may be the case, as  other Members have suggested, that we will find another way round the  problem. I was particularly pleased to hear the Minister of Finance and  Personnel say &mdash; if I heard him correctly &mdash; that we will examine what will  happen in 2011. At this stage, all that we can do is change the phasing in. If  we do nothing, the figure will go straight to 100% in 2011. Perhaps the  Minister will clarify that at some stage.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Make no mistake: if we put up rates, we will lose  manufacturing companies and jobs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Farry talked about sunset industries, and how we should  take money away from this sector and put it somewhere else. Let us consider  Northern Ireland plc: where is there growth at the moment? Transport and  transportation equipment is one of our big growth sectors, dominated by two  companies: Wrightbus and Bombardier. The next is rubber and chemicals, and I  know that Mr Newton is well involved in those sorts of things. The firm that  leads is Dupont. When we come to that exciting, big-profit earner for Northern Ireland,  non-ferous mineral products, that turns out to be the manufacture of concrete  blocks. What do all of those companies have in common? They need space &mdash; and  that, Mr Farry, is the big difference between manufacturers and retailers.  Manufacturers need a lot of space because they employ many people; however,  they have the freedom to move. If they move, we lose not only the rates, but  the national insurance, tax and VAT. We cannot afford to let our big companies  leave.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is another reason that Northern Ireland must maintain this  intervention. We have a porous land border with one of the fastest-growing  economies in the world. No other part of the world faces such an economic  challenge. Furthermore, there is a stretch of water that is very expensive to  cross between us and our primary market, Great Britain. Those factors have  to be overcome. Manufacturing needs this intervention. Otherwise, if I heard  him correctly, Mr Farry is telling the 90,000 people who work in manufacturing  that: their jobs are not valuable, that we do not want manufacturing and that  we want something else. Did you ever hear the like of it?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Farry took some exception to the analysis of gross value  added (GVA). The GVA estimate for Northern Ireland is roughly &pound;22,000  million. That represents a GVA per capita of &pound;12,971, which is 81% of the UK average. In Northern Ireland, manufacturing accounts for 16%  of that GVA: that is higher than the UK average which is 14%, and it is  certainly much higher than the proportion accounted for by farming and  agriculture, which is only 1%. Manufacturers, particularly big manufacturers,  drive most of our private sector.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The average figure of GVA per head in the region for Northern Ireland  is &pound;14,000: in manufacturing, however, the average GVA is &pound;49,000. The problem  for our economy is that we shed highly-paid workers, who deliver high  value-added to the economy, and replace them with part-time workers in leisure,  hospitality and retail &mdash; a sector in which GVA is only &pound;8,000 per annum on  average.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For that reason our productivity is falling. There is  nothing more important than raising productivity. We are fully employed, but we  get less for it. The only way to deal with that &mdash; though, perhaps Mr Farry or  someone else has a better idea &mdash; is by investment. That is what a tax on  industrial derating is: it is a tax on investment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Farry questioned the Minister of Finance and Personnel  about being selective in the way that he read the report from ERINI. The  Minister can comment on that; however, other reports were not commented on,  which indicates the weakness of Mr Farry&rsquo;s research and the flaws in his  arguments. The report by DTZ Pieda Consulting suggested that:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;while there would be specific cases where the removal  of industrial de-rating would lead to adverse effects, the overall effect on  the level of economic activity in the medium term would be negligible.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That report suggested that, even if 100% of rates  were applied, the cost would amount to only 2&middot;7% of profits, not the 15% that  Mr Farry talked about. That showed, once and for all, that the DTZ report was  complete and utter drivel.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">What about the previous ERINI report, that of 2005,  &lsquo;Measurement and Benchmarking of Competitiveness &mdash; The Cost of Doing business  in Northern Ireland&rsquo;?  That concluded that Northern    Ireland was a pretty good place to do  business. It said that there are more expensive energy, transport and  environmental costs, but labour and property are cheap.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Dr Farry has taken that  headline figure. The problem is that the next page of the report says  that that does not apply to manufacturing.  Cheaper labour for manu&shy;facturing is available in the Republic of Ireland,  but when the report refers to savings in property, it means office not  manufacturing space. In fact, six regions of the  United Kingdom  have cheaper manufacturing space than  this place. By 2009, the Republic   of Ireland will be  uncompetitive to us. More attention to  detail might help.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A report entitled &lsquo;The Future of Manufacturing in Northern Ireland&rsquo;  was prepared for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment by  Pricewaterhouse&shy;Coopers. It forecasts 40,000 job losses if we do not get  investment. More research can be added to that. What did Moy Park Ltd,  Wrightbus Ltd, the CBI and the Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union  say to the Programme for Government? They all said repeatedly that an end to  industrial derating is not the right way to go. The Alliance Party&rsquo;s position  is spurious nonsense and an attempt to gain short-term party political  advantage. It is a disgrace.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There have been differences of opinion on whether we have  won this battle. Some Members present supported the meeting at the Waterfront  Hall, which was a great day. We spoke to Mr Hain, who told us that we were  wasting our time.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  That was not a great day.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  That was not a great day, as Mr Wilson knows.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Northern Ireland Manufacturing Focus Group received a  letter saying that the Government had heard what we had to say but that the  answer was no. We had to call upon some friends. I pay tribute to those from  the union Amicus who sorted out a meeting with Mr Hain in Westminster. It was slightly unfortunate that  that meeting was scheduled for 12 July, but  we attended on that date. Forty-eight hours later, a change of policy  was made. On 30 January 2007, David Hanson said:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I announced on 23 November 2006 that the level of  rate liability for manufacturers in 2007/2008 would be 30% rather than 35%. I  can now confirm that the legislation to bring this into operation from 1 April  2007 has been laid at Westminster.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Does Dr Farry not understand that there were  arguments to be put? The Government did not agree to a freeze simply because we  asked them; we had to fight not only the Ministers, but the Treasury. We had to  fight people who told us that there was no chance of making any progress on the  issue, that the Assembly had considered it not once but twice and that there  were reports from ERINI, DTZ Pieda and elsewhere. Those reports are from people  who know the price of everything and the value of nothing. In my intervention I  challenged Dr Farry to say whether anyone in the Alliance Party had any idea of  what it is like to run a business in a competitive world. Businesses need our  help, not our platitudes and admonishments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Manufacturing is based in our rural areas. Few Members have  not seen manufacturing plants close and move across the border or elsewhere.  Once they are gone, they are gone. People in Strabane know what happened when  Adria went, with the building of houses. The  big companies will call in the professionals. The biggest argument that  we made to direct rule Ministers was that increasing industrial rating will not  increase the rates tax, because businesses will find ways of dealing with it.  They will either downsize or bring their sites together. Moy  Park, for example, went to a single  site; eventually, those single sites will move to Normandy or somewhere else. The ending of  industrial derating is a flawed policy. There must be derating, and I accept  the argument that in an imperfect world one must use whatever tools are  available. This tool is available, and it is right that we should use it. If it  had been up to me, I would have capped industrial rates at a lower value than  30%. A line can be drawn in the sand, and I hope that all Members will not only  keep it at 30% for the lifetime of this Assembly, but in future Assemblies.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If the Alliance Party wants to consider opposition, its  members should read some reports on the issue.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  I almost feel sorry for Dr Farry &mdash; the emphasis being on the word &ldquo;almost&rdquo; &mdash; as  he has rightly been the butt of attacks from all sides of the House, during  this and previous debates on the matter. Those of us who have listened to the  hard-pressed taxpayers and industrialists in Northern Ireland know that the  Finance Minister&rsquo;s decisions were made in response to genuine calls from people  who say that they do not want to have more taxes heaped on them and that we  must find a way of ensuring competitiveness for industry. However, Dr Farry has  ensured that the Alliance Party will be for ever known as the fiscal Fegans of  the Assembly. It picks people&rsquo;s pockets at every opportunity, and if it can get  its hand in as well, it will do so &mdash; as deeply as possible. In fact, it might  also try to get its arm in.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I also feel sorry for Dr Farry because I suspect that he  thought that he was not alone in opposing the Order. Indeed, he has been led up  the garden path by the SDLP. During the Committee meetings on the matter, the  SDLP gave the impression that it would back the Alliance Party in opposing the  Finance Minister&rsquo;s measure. However, I suspect that some time between that  meeting when the vote was taken and this morning, Mr O&rsquo;Loan had an opportunity  to read the Official Report of 12 June 2007. When he realised what he and his  colleague for Newry and Armagh Dominic Bradley said, he began to realise &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  hope that the Member listened to me earlier when I repeated what I said at the  Committee meeting in question: my only concern about the matter was the fact  that the Assembly and the Departments have still not addressed the important  issue that was highlighted in the ERINI  report and that the Committee presented in its report to the Minister of  Finance and Personnel, which is that we need to work out a new relationship  between the manufacturing sector and the Assembly and its Departments. I made  that point only, and I made it clearly today. If the Member thinks about that,  he might realise that he is ploughing a furrow that does not need to be  ploughed and that will not yield any grain &mdash; to refer to the next debate.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  I suspect that Mr O&rsquo;Loan may have to retract what he has said if I plough that  furrow a little deeper. From what I gather &mdash; and he can correct me if I am  wrong &mdash; he did not merely express concern about  the Order at the Committee meeting, but he voted to reject it. If he  wishes to correct me, I am happy to be corrected. On that basis alone, the poor  unsuspecting members of the Alliance Party thought that they had an ally. At  least we will not take all the &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  assure the Member that the comments that members of the Alliance Party make  are, indeed, the thoughts of the Alliance Party. We are happy to be here as  sole voices of sanity in the midst of all the chaos on the issue. If people  wish to support us, that is fine: if they do not, that is also fine. My position  is not influenced one bit by whether other parties wish to support us today.  However, I am confident that there are people in society, including those in  the Economic Research Institute of Northern Ireland, which produced the report,  who will concur with our remarks.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>: I thank the Member for that intervention. I am glad that at  least Mr O&rsquo;Loan was given an opportunity to eat his words before he eats his  dinner. He should have availed himself of that opportunity.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Not only does the Alliance Party have fiscal Fagans in its  membership, it has fiscal Fagans who suffer from schizophrenia. Alliance Party  Members have spoken on industrial rates twice in the Chamber: once during the  Hain Assembly in 2006; and on 12 June 2007. I suppose a person is allowed to  change his or her mind between 2006 and 2008, but to change it between 12 June  2007 and now is pushing it a wee bit.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will remind Members of the Alliance Party&rsquo;s position on  industrial rating. In June 2007, the Ulster Unionist Party moved a motion calling  for the Finance Minister to implement the recommendation that rates be frozen  at 25%. The DUP tabled an amendment to the motion and proposed that the  Assembly call</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;upon the Executive to consider the resolution made by the  &lsquo;Hain&rsquo; Assembly on 6 June 2006, concerning industrial rates, in light of the  impact of rating on manufacturing in Northern Ireland and in the context of  other priorities in the Comprehensive Spending Review, having considered the  independent assessment presently being carried out into the matter by the  Economic Research Institute of Northern Ireland (ERINI).&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Official  Report, Bound Volume 22, p442, col 2]</span>.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Alliance Party to a man &mdash; and a woman &mdash; voted  in favour of that amendment. Dr Farry said that:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Alliance  Party leans towards supporting the DUP amendment&rdquo;. &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official Report, Bound  Volume 22, p449, col 1]</span></span>.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">He continued:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I understand why the manufacturing sector wants to  retain industrial derating, and in the absence of any other mechanism, that  retention is particularly important. In the absence of any wider package, it is  important that the Assembly lobbies for some form of industrial derating to  address the problems that the manufacturing sector is encountering.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official  Report, Bound Volume 22, p449, col 2]</span></span>.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">He also said that:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the proposal is worthy of consideration, but it needs  to be addressed within the comprehensive spending review as part of an <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">overall package.&rdquo; &mdash; </span><span class="Italic"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; font-style:normal; ">[Official  Report, Bound Volume 22, p449, col 2]</span></span>.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">He finished by saying that:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;It is important that we do not let the issue of  industrial derating fall off the table.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official Report, Bound Volume 22, p450, col 1]</span></span>.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">He made that stirring remark to the cheers of the  Galleries and, no doubt, to manufacturers all over Northern Ireland. They had a  champion who would not let the issue of industrial derating fall off the table.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  The ERINI report states that it is safe to move from 30% industrial rating to  50% &mdash; a move that I would support. There would still be considerable industrial  derating, and it would be better to use the resources that the Executive would  receive to invest <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">across the whole economy.  I do not see an inconsistency</span> in our approach; it is an evolution based  on the facts in the ERINI report, the comprehensive spending review and the  Budget.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  That would have provided at least a semi-plausible explanation for the Alliance  Party&rsquo;s turnaround, had it been the only condition set by the Member on 12  June; however, he laid down other <span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt; ">conditions  relating to the comprehensive spending review</span>, for instance. The  comprehensive spending review has taken place, and Members know what the  situation will be. The Minister of Finance and Personnel has made his decisions  on the basis of that comprehensive spending review and the availability of  resources.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Dr Farry also said that industrial derating should be  retained only in the absence of an alternative package. Therefore he said that  industrial derating should be looked at in the context of the comprehensive  spending review, which we have had; in the context of other packages, which are  not in place; and in the context of the ERINI report.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not claim to be on top of such issues, but, as the  Member for Lagan Valley said &mdash; and he knows more about  such things &mdash; other reports have rubbished that idea. However, even if that  were to be the case, and whether one  considers the ERINI report or the Minister&rsquo;s announcement, the principle  has been established that some form of industrial rates relief is important in  order to protect profits and investments and to make industry competitive.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If we are now quibbling  about 30% or 50% industrial rates relief, that is not the Member for  North Down&rsquo;s argument. Although I do not have shorthand, I have noted it down.  He said that the arguments are weak: if we were starting with a clean sheet of  paper, we would not do that, and, in any case, transportation, energy and  labour costs are more important. He said that that was not very important &mdash; but it was important in June 2007. It was so  important that, in the absence of a package and in the context of the  comprehensive spending review &mdash; which we now have &mdash; it was insisted that we  should not let it fall off the table. However, not only has it now been knocked  off the table but it has been put into the dustbin.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The only conclusion that I can come to is that the Alliance Party &mdash; in its important role as the  Assembly&rsquo;s official opposition &mdash; does not care what proposal comes from  the Minister, how well thought out or argued it is, or even what its members  have said about the subject in the past; its members must vote against it.  Although the point has already been made, that is not what opposition is about.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am not worried about the Alliance Party, but it does no  credit to a party simply to oppose, because, when a situation arises in which  real opposition might be important, opposition from such a party will lack  credibility.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">Let us consider some of  the Member&rsquo;s other argu&shy;ments</span>. He said that more emphasis should be  placed on <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">a change to the economy&rsquo;s balance,  which is exactly what</span> the Minister of Finance and Personnel was  attempting to achieve in his Budget &mdash; a change in the economy&rsquo;s balance from a  public-sector-dominated economy to one with a greater emphasis on the private  sector.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If we assume that that is the shift of balance that the  Alliance Party wants, what did Dr Farry suggest? He wants to make it more  difficult for the private sector to earn profits and to invest. Between now and  2012, his suggestions would mean that &pound;144 million &mdash; and &pound;50 million a year  after that &mdash; would be taken from the private sector, which is some way to  change the balance. Dr Farry said that he is a doctor of political philosophy;  however, if he thinks that that is a good way to change the balance of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  economy, economics cannot have featured much on his course. He wants to move  the balance towards the private sector, but he gives that sector&rsquo;s costs and  profits a good kicking.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We have had this debate two or three times before in the Assembly, and, as one would expect under  devolution, the Minister has responded to the concerns raised &mdash; in this  instance, by the manufacturing industry &mdash; by arguing why the previous Secretary  of State was taking us in the wrong direction.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Rather than simply voting against the motion to show that  it is the opposition party, perhaps it would be better if the Alliance Party  had second thoughts, just like the SDLP has had over the last week. Instead of  eating their words, its members could back up their previous words with action  and vote for the motion.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr P Robinson)</strong>: I thank all the Members who have  contri&shy;buted to the debate. Collectively, we have considerably outperformed the expectations of the Business  Committee, which allocated 15 minutes for the debate. It should have  been finished before lunch, but we are still at it &mdash; although I will not delay  the House too long now.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Order is short, but, nevertheless, it represents a  significant move for the manufacturing sector, which has experienced a steady  loss of employment as well as a continuous decline in output. Everyone is aware  of the all-too-familiar announcements in recent years of redundancies and  closures that have been brought about by external factors, particularly  competition from the lower-cost economies in the Far East.  I trust that the pegging of the rates burden at 30% will encourage companies to  compete more effectively and to diversify and prosper. In meetings that I have  had with people in the manufacturing sector, I have been encouraged to hear that  that decision has provided them with the motivation that they need to proceed  with plans for expansion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Most of the points that  were raised today are not new to us; we have heard them in other  debates. However, if Members felt that they were worth repeating, then I am  quite happy to repeat the responses to them. I thank the Deputy Chairperson of  the Finance and Personnel Committee, and I very much welcome the Committee&rsquo;s  support. Mr Beggs also expressed his support as a Committee member.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Declan O&rsquo;Loan confined his disquiet to one element of the  ERINI report, though quite what element of the report required him to vote  against this piece of legislation is not clear. His voting in Committee should  have been on the issue that was being discussed by the Committee &mdash; this piece  of legislation, not the ERINI report. I trust that his more measured tones  today were a sign that the SDLP will support the legislation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, I will touch on an issue that he raised both in  Committee and in the House: a concordat between Government and industry. I said  during the Budget debate on 12 February  that the communication channels <span style="letter-spacing:-.3pt; ">between  the wider industry and Government were in place</span>. We are already creating a much better atmosphere and  relationship with the business sector. Of course, in the first instance, that  matter would be one for my colleague Nigel Dodds, the ETI Minister, to  consider. However, I will do everything that I can to contribute towards that  goal.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Basil McCrea asked if he had heard me right when I  remarked on what would happen after the CSR period. I put it on record that the  current primary legislation permits changes  to be made to the percentage liability only until the year ending March  2011. After that dates, rates will revert to 100% liability. That is why I said that I would be seeking to amend the  primary legislation as soon as practicable; that will allow us to ensure  that we do not move to 100% liability. If the Member looks again at my speech,  he will see what my mind is as regards the outcome, although I suspect that the  legislation itself would allow the decisions to be taken by some subordinate  legislation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member for North Down Dr Farry raised a number of  issues and also asked some questions. If liability were kept at 30% instead of  being increased to 50%, the estimated revenue loss for the year would be  approximately &pound;7 million from the regional rate. Therefore, the Member should  include in his calculations whether the risk to the manufacturing sector is  worth &pound;7 million. Most people will conclude that the income is too small for  such a risk to be taken.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps I should not be hurt by Dr Farry&rsquo;s remarks. To a  large extent, his criticisms are synthetic. I am convinced that, had I proposed  an industrial rate level of 50%, he would have proposed an amendment to reduce  it to 30% or perhaps even to 25%.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Alliance Party members are on record on the issue, and the  Member for Lagan Valley Mr McCrea quoted their position on other public issues.  My colleague the Member for East Antrim  Sammy Wilson indicated what Members from that party said during a debate  in 2007.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, the House was unanimous on the issue of industrial  rating on 6 June 2006. During that debate, Mr Sean Neeson expressed the views  of the Alliance Party in no uncertain terms. I note that he is not present this  afternoon. I am sure that there is no connection between his absence and his  disquiet at the Alliance Party&rsquo;s position. During that debate, he stated:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;We cannot underestimate the importance of the  surviving manufacturing base in Northern    Ireland. However, as I have said in previous  debates, we face many challenges, particularly from the global economy. We have  seen the damage that has been done to the textile sector, which has almost  disappeared. The discussions that we have had with NIMFG have shown that jobs  are at risk in Northern    Ireland. It is not, as other Members stated,  a &lsquo;Wolf, wolf!&rsquo; situation.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official Report, Bound Volume 19, p64, col 1]</span></span>.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Therefore, he was contending for the manufacturing  industry back in 2006. Mr Neeson went on to say:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The parties represented in the Chamber are agreed on  the issue and have met the Secretary of State. He put the ball in our court and  said that if we want to deal with the issue &mdash; he does not have a problem with  us doing that&rdquo;. &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official Report, Bound Volume 19, p64, col 1]</span></span>.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Today&rsquo;s proposal is to keep the industrial rate at  30%. As that quotation shows, the Alliance Party supported keeping industrial  rating at 25%, and its Members suggested that devolution would enable us to do  so. Now that we have devolution and can deal with that issue ourselves, they  want the rate doubled to 50%.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the earlier debate, Dr Farry lectured us on what he  described as selective quotations &mdash; I think that that was the term that he  used. When he intervened during Mr Sammy Wilson&rsquo;s contribution, he said that  the ERINI report said that it was safe to move to 50%. The ERINI report does  not say that. To put words into the mouths of the ERINI reporting team is worse  than selective reporting.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The report indicated that there was a relatively small  risk. Therefore, it was Dr Farry who mischievously used selective quotations. I  will read the quotation to Members, who can check it when they get their copy  of Hansard tomorrow. When quoting from the ERINI report, he said:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;At 50% implementation no more than an estimated 10%  of companies are likely to face rate bills much more than 15% of their profits.  Proceeding to this point would incur a relatively small risk to industry as a  whole&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">He then jumped, not telling anybody that he had done so, to  say:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Proceeding no further than this degree of  implementation is the position we favour.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The bit of the ERINI report that he left out because it did  not suit his case, was:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;though the decline of marginal sectors such as  Textiles would be accelerated.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">He deliberately left that section out. I will now read the  whole sentence from the ERINI report:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Proceeding to this point would incur a relatively  small risk to industry as a whole, though the decline of marginal sectors such  as Textiles would be accelerated.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It does not say &ldquo;safe&rdquo;;  it says &ldquo;a relatively small risk&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Dr Farry might like to go to Portadown and tell Ulster  Carpets that they can have that increase, even though it will accelerate their  decline. He might like to go to Banbridge, and tell it to Ulster Weavers, or to  his own constituency in North Down and tell it to Regency Carpets, or to some  of the other small manufacturing concerns in the textile sector whose demise he  is going to accelerate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is abundantly clear  that there is selective quotation of  the ERINI report from the Alliance Party on this issue. Alliance Party  members are trying to disguise the fact that the ERINI report did not say that  it was safe, but that there was a relatively small risk. As a Government who  put economic growth in Northern    Ireland as their number one priority, we are  not prepared to take a relatively small risk with people&rsquo;s jobs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When the manufacturers themselves were faced with the  question of what they would do if rates were increased as proposed, their  answers were clear: in some cases they would move outside Northern Ireland;  some would not expand their businesses; some would lay off employees; and in  some cases employees would not get any further wage increases. That was the  prospect that we faced. That is why, in the ERINI report, the recommendation  was not simply to increase to 50%. The Member needs to look at that report more  closely, as it says:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;In our view this points to the movement towards a  maximum 50%&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I repeat: &ldquo;the movement towards&rdquo;. But, of course, Alliance  Party members are way out ahead &mdash; they want it at 50% straight away; they want  it upfront; they want it doubled from the 25% that they were asking for and  that they agreed with everybody just a few years ago.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Alliance Party members are going to have a difficult task  explaining to manufacturing companies in each of their constituencies why they  want to accelerate those companies&rsquo; demise, stop them from expanding, push them  out of Northern Ireland, have them dismiss employees in their area, or ensure  that their wages are held down.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For our part, when we stated in the Programme for  Government that we believe that our priority should be economic growth, that is  what we meant. It would have been wholly inconsistent for the Government to say  that we want to drive towards economic growth, expect to have better  productivity, and expect to improve our gross value added GVA, and, at the same  time, create a more difficult situation for the sector that can contribute  towards increasing our GVA, better productivity, and growth in our economy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I trust that the Assembly will support the motion. I hope  that I have managed to cover all the substantive points that have been raised  by Members &mdash; if I have not, I will write to the Members concerned when I read  Hansard.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Before we proceed to the Question, I remind Members that the  motion requires cross-community support.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved (with cross-community support):</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That this Assembly approves the Rates (Industrial  Hereditaments) (Amendment) Order (Northern Ireland) 2008.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="8"></a>Private Members&rsquo; Business</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Grain Scarcity</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30  minutes for the debate. The proposer of the  motion will have 10 minutes to propose and 10 minutes for the winding-up  speech. All other Members will have five minutes to speak.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">One amendment has been selected and published in the  Marshalled List. The proposer of the amendment will have 10 minutes to propose  and five minutes for the winding-up speech.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>: I  beg to move</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes with concern the scarcity of grain  within Europe, which is having a detrimental effect on the profits of the  production sector, as a result of higher grain prices; and calls on the  Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development to provide intervention support  to the intensive production sector that relies upon grain.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I thank the Minister for her attendance at this  debate, amid many pressures and concerns at the present time, including  bluetongue. It is most appreciated.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not have a problem with the tabled amendment, although  others may have different opinions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Before I continue, I declare an interest as a farmer  myself. I have first-hand experience of feeling the pinch as a result of the  grain price rises.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">&lsquo;The Guardian&rsquo; put the situation perfectly on 26 February  2008, when it said:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;In the last year, however, creeping rises quickened  to a canter &mdash; and then a gallop.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">This issue would make an excellent case study for  students of economics. Thankfully, the Members for East Antrim Mr Sammy Wilson  and Mr Roy Beggs are in the Chamber today, and may correct me if I make any  mistakes. We agree that the definition of value is how much someone is prepared  to pay for something. The rise in grain prices is caused by more demand than  there is supply, at the current time. The value of the required commodity will  keep rising.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">According to the  International Grains Council, global wheat  inventories have fallen to their lowest levels since 1979. That is because sowing in the northern  hemisphere is down, particularly in Canada, due to  the poor weather having an adverse effect on the crop. In the southern  hemisphere, the main supplier, Australia,  has slashed its forecasts from its usual 20 to 25 million tons to 12&middot;1 million  tons, owing to extreme drought across the  country. That drought also reduced Australia&rsquo;s dairy output by 15%. Furthermore, according to the BBC  news on 26 February 2008, a drought  in northern China,  where most of the country&rsquo;s wheat is grown, is pushing the prices  higher.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">&lsquo;The Economist&rsquo; on 23 February 2008 said:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;America&rsquo;s  Department of Agriculture believes global demand for wheat will continue to  exceed supply this year. That will push America&rsquo;s wheat stocks to their  lowest level since 1948.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">We have all felt the pinch because of the lack of  grain, and I am sure that all Members have noticed that the price of a loaf of  bread has risen considerably over the past six months. Food industry executives  expect the prices of meat, poultry and dairy products to rise, as farmers and  processors pass on the higher costs to consumers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That scarcity of grain causes difficulty at the farm gate.  To put it simply, the farmer is no better off. Any rise in the milk cheque or  the price of a kilogram of beef is offset by the rise in the cost of feed. That  will only cause the industry to stagnate, and we cannot allow that to happen.  According to volume 71, number 6 of the &lsquo;Northern Ireland Agricultural Market  Report&rsquo;, prices of wheat and barley have risen steeply over the last year.  Wheat costs 71% more, and barley is 60% more expensive.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That in turn leads to a cost impact for the farmer, as it  takes roughly 10 kg of feed to produce 1 kg  of beef. According to the Northern Ireland Grain Trade Association  (NIGTA), feed material costs have risen by &pound;80 per metric ton.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That rise in the cost of grain will result in the following  additional costs to the farmer: an extra 30p per kilogram for pig production;  an increase of 25% in the production costs of poultry; the cost of producing a  dozen eggs will rise by 20p; intensive beef farming will cost an extra 40p per  kilogram, and the cost of producing a litre of milk from an average dairy cow  will rise by 3p.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Given the increase in the cost of grain, sooner or later  farmers will have no option but to seek cheaper alternatives for animal feed.  The farming industry does not want to go in that direction. I am not sure that  it would be good for consumer confidence in  the products, never mind the industry.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On 4 September 2007, the &lsquo;Financial Times&rsquo; quoted the stark  warning of several analysts:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the world community is approaching a food crisis in  2008 unless usage of agricultural products for biofuels is curbed or ideal  weather conditions and sharply higher crop yields are achieved in 2008&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The problem is that the United States devoted several  million tons of grain to the production of ethanol. President Bush&rsquo;s target of  producing 35 billion gallons of ethanol by 2017 requires &mdash; and Members must listen to the figure &mdash; 342 million tons of corn.  Prices of corn and wheat in the United States have doubled in the  past 12 months. It has 109 ethanol plants, and a further 53 are being built.  Yet the supply of grain is at an all-time low. A report in the &lsquo;Financial  Times&rsquo; on 17 February 2008 quoted the vice-president for govern&shy;ment relations  of the American Bakers Association. She said that grain:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;is currently at a very low one-month level, which is  extremely concerning.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On 26 February 2008, the &lsquo;Guardian&rsquo; reported:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;subsidies to biofuels, particularly in the US, are  distorting global farming. The 60m tonnes of American maize being burned each  year represents more than twice the UK&rsquo;s entire cereal crop.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Ethanol is one such biofuel that is being subsidised.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  Does the Member find it ironic that the environmentalists, who argue that there  should be a move towards the increased use of biofuels, are encouraging a  development that results in people starving throughout the world? In any case,  biofuels are not even environmentally friendly. </p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>: I thank the Member for his inter&shy;vention: that was exactly the  point that I was about to make.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Before outlining what I want the Minister to do to help the farming community, here is a sobering  analysis by the Northern Ireland  Grain Trade Association:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Feed prices will increase by 50% on farms; farmgate  prices need to go up by 25% to keep pace, and the retail price must move by 5%  to 10% for the industry to survive.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">On 10 September 2007, the Minister of Agriculture  and Rural Development said in the House:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;They [the farmers] cannot be expected to continue to  make losses against the massive, and increasing, input cost.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official  Report, Vol 23, No 5, p233, col 1]</span></span>.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Every Member will agree with that statement.  Several options are open to the Minister to enable  her to provide badly needed assistance to the industry. Although I do  not expect that an offer of financial assistance is on the table, never mind  forthcoming, I ask her to consider other options. It is possible to lobby local  retailers and supermarkets to ensure that farmers and producers receive a fair  and reasonable price for their products. She must ensure that local retailers  and supermarkets source only local products and that they label them to  advertise the fact to consumers, who, I hope, will want to buy locally sourced  products. I ask the Minister to consider those available options.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, and most importantly, will the Minister do  everything in her power to ensure that Northern Ireland farmers have a steady  and more than adequate supply of grain to keep the agriculture industry alive  in Northern Ireland?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion has forewarned of the food shortages that could  happen in the near future. I do not want to raise fears or expectations that  there will be a food scarcity, but if action is not taken, such a difficult  situation could arise. In moving the motion, I trust that the House will rally  round and give its overwhelming support to the industry, which provides for the  entire community on a daily basis.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bresland</strong>: I beg to move the following amendment: After &ldquo;grain&rdquo; insert:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;, and to lobby the European Union on the approval of new  biotech varieties&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Speaker, thank you  for giving me the opportunity to speak in the debate. I congratulate the  Members who tabled the motion, and I say at the outset that the amendment does not aim to take away from the  motion; rather, it aims to add to it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Even if the Minister  were to announce to the Assembly that she could intervene, such  involvement would not be a long-term solution and would not tackle any of the  factors that have pushed up the price of grain. It is vital that the Minister  uses whatever influence she has to help to reduce the price that farmers are  forced to pay for grain.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s livestock sector has been under  considerable pressure for several years. It faces challenges from the nitrates  directive feed costs, fertiliser costs, and  the power of the large super&shy;markets to drive down prices. Members  understand that a local Minister cannot solve many of those problems, which  exist on a global scale. However, it is important that she uses any influence  that she has to change matters that could affect local farmers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The amendment asks that the Minister lobby the European  Commission on the approval of new grain varieties. The debate is not about  whether genetically modified (GM) crops should be grown here; it is about the  import of grain and the speed at which varieties are approved for import,  particularly from countries such as America. Genetically modified  varieties are already imported into Europe and  will eventually end up being approved.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the United    States, the process for the approval of  genetically modified varieties takes around 12 months. However, that process takes around 36 months in Europe.  Although the Minister obviously does not have the power to solve that problem  herself, she could give the Assembly her commitment that she will lobby the European Commission in order to speed up the  approval process. The fact that it takes so long for those new varieties  to be approved simply means that less grain is available for use by local farmers. If the approval process were  speeded up, that could directly affect farmers in Northern Ireland. Solving that  problem would also directly affect the price of grain and would come at no cost  to the European Union or to DARD. Most importantly, it would save farmers  money.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The power of the large supermarkets to drive prices down is  another area of concern. Although the price of beef and lamb has improved  recently, there is still a considerable distance to go before farmers can make  a sustainable profit. Part of that is due to the fact that there is constant  pressure from supermarkets to drive down prices. When the public are being sold  chickens that cost &pound;1.99, there is no way that the farmer can make any profit.  Every time that supermarkets reduce their prices, they demand that farmers  receive less for their products.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Even when the prices on supermarkets shelves have been increased, as they have in recent months,  the extra money is never passed down to the farmer. Members need only  look at the profits that are made by super&shy;markets and compare them to those of  many farmers, who do not make any money for their labour. Tesco has announced  profits of nearly &pound;2 billion from its own sales.  Although those are the profits of just one super&shy;market chain, they are  probably far in excess of the combined profits of every farmer throughout the UK.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that everyone in the House supports the farmers  in their plight. It is important that the Minister does whatever possible to  improve the conditions under which they struggle. I hope that Members will  support the call for action to be taken in areas that will directly affect  farmers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">DARD should also look at ways to develop skills in the  farming community so that farmers can react to the challenge of growing  cereals. Although that may have a limited impact, many Northern Ireland  farmers are interested in growing cereals but have a limited knowledge of the  subject.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I support the amendment. The issues that it raises could benefit our farmers. I hope that Members  support the amendment because it seeks to add to the original motion.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Sinn F&eacute;in is opposed to GM crops  being grown in Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">According to the  Confederation of the Food and Drink Industries of the European Union,  prices for wheat, dairy products and sunflower oil in the EU rose by 35%, 50% and  25% respectively in 2007. As a result, the price of food products made directly  from those commodities, such as bread, pasta and other dietary basics, and  those made indirectly, such as pork, poultry, beef, milk and eggs, is on the  rise. There are three main reasons for the drastic rise in price: the  increasing use of crops for bio-energy, particularly in the USA; an increase in  the demand for meat and milk products in the developing world, particularly in  China and India &mdash; as the economies of those countries flourish, so does the  lifestyle and diet of the people there; and poor harvests around the world  after droughts and floods, particularly in Australia.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The effects of climate change cannot be ignored. We are  merely paying lip service to sustainability. Our farming community requires  support so that it can be sustainable in every aspect of its business.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Allan Bresland outlined the crux of the issue &mdash; the  stranglehold on the agriculture industry. That appears to benefit only the  supermarkets, which have still managed large increases in profit margins since  the price increases began. The ultimate challenge is to find a way to loosen  the grip of the supermarkets on an already overburdened industry. Finding other  adequate outlets for marketing food products without such an expensive  middleman is vital. We must ensure that our farmers receive a substantial  return for their produce, as well as encouraging and developing co-operatives.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Bakery firms are also  under pressure to raise customer prices to combat high commodity prices,  which, they say, is a necessary strategy to maintain profitability. Prices are  rising at almost unprecedented levels, so passing on cost is a business  strategy that bakers can no longer ignore, even if it risks angering consumers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Other industries are under pressure, including  microbreweries. While those industries face pressures, consumers face a massive  increase in their food bills, along with drastic rises in their fuel bills.  That puts immense pressure on the most vulnerable in our society. Young  families and pensioners find it very hard to make ends meet.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In respect of global demand, the world&rsquo;s population is  expected to exceed nine billion by 2050. The Food and Agriculture Organization  of the United Nations predicts that food demand will have grown by 55% between  1998 and 2030. The increased use of biofuels will also make demands on crops.  The consensus is that the area of land cultivated globally is not likely to  increase much in the shorter term.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Water shortages, particularly in Asia,  are another threat to increasing the production of agricultural commodities to  meet increased demand.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A report by independent research organisation Chatham House  states that, since 1980, the rate of new oil  discoveries has not kept pace with growth in demand. Rising oil prices have impacted on fertiliser  production.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The report states that there is a consensus that commodity  prices will remain high over the medium term, partly because of the predicted  demand-supply imbalance. It speculates that the EU may be forced into  acceptance of supply-boosting GM commodities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some 85% of the Chatham  House project participants who were interviewed said that they believed  that a different food supply dynamic is in prospect.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The report concludes that, in the long term, global supply  may not be able to meet demand unless there is sustainable management of global  resources, with constraints on the supply of land, water and oil demanding  particular attention. Any imbalance is likely to be felt through further  inflationary effects and increased competition to secure global supplies.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Industry commentary underlines the scarcity:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;World grain prices have increased dramatically on  three occasions since World War II, each time as the result of weather-reduced  harvests. But now it is a matter of demand simply outpacing supply. In seven of  the last eight years world grain production has fallen short of consumption.  These annual shortfalls have been covered by drawing down grain stocks, but the  carryover stocks &mdash; the amount in the bin when the new harvest begins &mdash; have now  dropped to 54 days of world consumption, the lowest on record &hellip; As grain prices  climb, a politics of food scarcity is emerging, as exporting countries restrict  exports to limit the rise in domestic food prices. At the end of January, Russia &mdash; one of  the top five wheat exporters &mdash; will impose a 40 per cent export tax on wheat,  effectively banning exports.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  In conclusion &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: We are very tight for time.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  I had better watch my time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">At the beginning of the debate, Sammy Wilson said that  farmers are now living in a world driven by environmentalists.  In the previous two decades, farmers have  been regularly forced to deal with Government. That is totally contrary to what farming was, and is,  all about.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Many farmers saw the writing on the wall when the UK  Government dropped &ldquo;agriculture&rdquo; from the title of the Department responsible  for the farming industry. The agriculture industry in the United Kingdom, which  current political arrangements make it impossible for us to escape from, or,  should I say, to which we are inextricably linked &mdash; I have heard that before &mdash;  means that turning to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  for assistance in a European context would be a pointless exercise.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Farmers have always been conscientious custodians of the  countryside, and were never the threat to the environment or wildlife that some  bureaucrats would have us believe. The plethora of anti-farming measures has  resulted in the decline of real farming activity. Many hundreds of acres of the  best land in Europe are now gradually in  decline, and that can be seen in each of the Six Counties. There is now  stagnation where once there was activity. Prime production land is no longer  used to grow grain, potatoes or root crops. In some areas there is now nothing  but gorse, bracken, briars and broom where there once was lush grass.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I know that this is quite demanding, but I call on the  Minister to provide intervention support to the sector so heavily dependent on grain &mdash; as the motion requests &mdash; and to devise a plan that would see a return to  crop-growing activity on family farms. What is the long-term future of farming? Does it have a long-term  future?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If the grain predicament continues, should the millers and  feed suppliers be permitted to introduce genetically modified grain to our  shores? That is an easy question to ask, but less easy to answer. The world is  greatly divided on the issue of genetically modified crops, and when the  subject is debated, those for and against the argument usually break down on a  50:50 basis. We must continue to side with those who know and have authentic  concerns about genetically modified products. By the same token, we must not be  influenced by the utterances of single-issue groups that express opposition  simply for opposition&rsquo;s sake, without any backup for their argument.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I stand open to correction, but I believe that all  political parties in the Assembly are opposed to the growing of genetically  modified crops in Ireland.  The SDLP&rsquo;s policy is to remain opposed to that. However, I accept that one day  the findings of scientists might suggest that we rethink our stance, but only a  rigorous scientific and ethical process of verification will command attention.  Research into GM agriculture must continue, however, and should be given the  necessary finances by Government to permit the research needed into what is  undeniably the fastest growing agricultural technology in the history of  farming. It should be noted that 250 million acres of genetically modified  crops were grown around the world in 2006, and there have been no reports of  ill effects on the people who consumed those crops.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Given the present grain situation, I understand the reason  for the amendment, although I will not be supporting it. However, I have  concerns about the uncertainty that surrounds genetically modified products. My  party could have supported the original motion, but I understand that we will  not be given an opportunity to do that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have every sympathy for the Minister, as it seems that some new crisis comes her way every week. I  wish her well on this matter, as it is the key to the survival of many  farmers. However, I have no suggestion as to where she will find the money or  what she will do.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>:  Grain scarcity is a worldwide problem, and its causes lie well outside Northern Ireland and, indeed, Europe.  Although there were poor harvests in parts of Europe  last year; grain producers in many parts of the world are recording bumper  crops. MPs in Australia  are worried that some of this year&rsquo;s record harvest will be left in the fields.  After years of declining production levels, Chinese grain production reached  its highest level for almost a decade in 2007.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The International Grains Council estimates that world grain  production was 1&middot;66 billion tons in 2007 &mdash; the largest crop on record. However,  the price of grain on the world market has hit another record. Record prices  are being driven by two factors, both of which are well outside the control of  the Assembly. First, there is the growing prosperity of many people in Asia and  Latin America. In 1985, the average person in China ate 20 kg  of meat a year. Today, that figure is 50 kg. The pigs and chickens that are  eaten by Chinese and Brazilian consumers must be reared on grain. People in the  developing world have every right to demand the same standard of living that we  take for granted. Secondly, there is ethanol production. &lsquo;The Economist&rsquo;  reckons that one third of the American corn harvest goes to ethanol production.  Given concern over global warming, that is another driver of high prices that  is not going to change.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Agricultural support policies are supposed to minimise the  impact of cycles of boom and bust on producers and consumers. The high price of  grain is not the result of a short-term economic cycle; it is the result of  long-term changes in the global economy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The high price of grain affects us all. Not only is the  intensive agricultural producer affected by high prices, the shopper who pays  more for a loaf of bread is affected equally, as is the employer who must pay  higher wages as food prices drive up inflation. Economically, it is not  rational to try to subsidise one&rsquo;s way out of a long-term problem. That only  encourages wasteful, subsidy-driven  production, which is a problem that we have seen demonstrated repeatedly  over three decades thanks to the common agricultural policy. Favouring one  section of the economy in dealing with a problem that affects everyone adds  even more distortions to the economy. It is a classic example of robbing Peter  to pay Paul.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The only people who benefit from high prices are grain  producers, so why do we not encourage farmers to use more land for grain  production. With modern farming techniques, it is feasible to grow corn in more  areas than ever before, and barley-growing is an option on all but the most  marginal land. That is how the Northern    Ireland economy can benefit from high grain  prices.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The proposal contained  in the motion is economically wasteful, and it is probably illegal under  European law anyway &mdash; that point must be taken into consideration. I am sure  that the Minister understands that, under EU regulations, difficulties would be  put in her way if she were to try to implement the suggestions that are being  brought before the Assembly today.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is vitally important that supermarkets give food  producers and livestock farmers the prices they deserve, taking into  consideration the extra costs they now face. Although I agree with the  sentiment behind the motion, the reality is somewhat different.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate. The  Agriculture Committee has heard evidence from groups such as the Ulster Pork  and Bacon Forum, the Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union and  also from the wider rural community of the problems that they face. It is vital  that we take what action we can to help. High grain prices have various causes,  many of them global and beyond our control; however, it is important that the  Minister use what influence she has to make an impact where she can.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I draw the Assembly&rsquo;s attention to the approval of new  crops for import into the European Union. The issue is important: it has a  direct impact on the grain prices paid by local farmers. However, it may be  misunderstood by Members and by the wider public.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As my colleague Mr Bresland said, the debate is not about  whether we support the growing of GM crops in Northern Ireland; that may be a  debate worth having, but it is not one for today. This is simply about the  import of GM varieties, particularly from countries such as America. GM  varieties are already imported into Europe,  although in relatively small quantities, so the principle has already been  accepted that they are safe to import and, therefore, safe to use.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It takes the EU three times as long as the US to approve  crops for use. It is not that Europe will  never approve those crops: it just takes far too long. Because the pace of  development is so fast and new varieties are approved so quickly in other parts  of the world, Europe&rsquo;s slowness creates a self-imposed  grain shortage for our farmers. More and more of the new varieties are grown  and demand across the world increases rapidly, particularly in developing  countries. Imports into the EU are limited by the non-approval of crops.  Increasing world demand, combined with a shortage of supply to Europe, will mean higher prices.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is also worth thinking about what happens when we do not  approve crops. The EU is quick to stop the import of crops, but it has no  problem in importing cheap beef or chicken that is fed on those crops and  produced with animal welfare standards that would be illegal in the EU. Our  farmers want a level playing field; they should not have to struggle with a  self-imposed stranglehold.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that all Members understand the real issue in the  debate, make no knee-jerk reaction to the mention of GM crops and support the  amendment. I hope that the Minister does all in her power to help our  hard-pressed farmers and makes a commitment to lobby the European Commission on the approval of those varieties.  Our farmers are suffering and lose money daily.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I support the amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>:  I welcome the debate and the opportunity to speak on it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I declare an interest as a farmer &mdash; not as a grain farmer,  but as a farmer all the same. As a beef farmer, I have first-hand experience of  the problems caused by rising grain prices.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some may believe that the issue is unimportant or that it  affects only farmers. They could not be more wrong. An increase in beef prices  has a knock-on effect on all related food groups, as farmers see their profit  margins evaporate, yet they have still to pay high prices for livestock feed.  Supermarkets will seek to pass on any increase to the consumer; that means more  expensive food in shopping baskets. That will raise inflation generally and  turn a farming problem into a political one.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is estimated that, for the past 15 years, there has been  a decline in the cost of food in the UK  and Europe. That is what consumers want, and  they have come to expect their politicians to deliver it. However, in recent  months consumers have begun to experience an increase in the cost of food, and  if that trend continues, there will be political consequences. One of the main  problems is that the price of bread, one of our staple foods, will be affected  by the increase in the price of grain.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On 28 February this year, the &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo; predicted  that there would be an increase of &pound;18 per week in the average family shopping  basket. The Northern Ireland Food and Drink Association is also concerned that  the cost of groceries could increase by 20% in 2008.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That will impact on us all, but it will especially hit  people on low and fixed incomes, who are already struggling to make ends meet.  If difficult times lie ahead for consumers, difficult times are already with  the pig industry. For some time, I and others have been warning about the  crisis in the local pig industry, and the situation has shown no improvement.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On 17 February, &lsquo;The Observer&rsquo; estimated that pig farmers  across the UK are in crisis because huge increases in grain prices mean that  they are losing up to &pound;20 for every animal that they produce. Experts warn that  the industry faces an end unless the price of pork and bacon rises, but such a  move has so far been rejected by supermarkets. &lsquo;The Observer&rsquo; reported that  global wheat prices have doubled in a year to &pound;180 a ton, owing to soaring  demand for grain in India  and China. The decision by an increasing number of farmers to switch from  wheat to maize for biofuels is also being blamed. As feed comprises 50% of pig  farmers&rsquo; costs, the rise in the price of  wheat is proving disastrous for them &mdash; even though bacon is the  country&rsquo;s most frequently eaten meat, with  the average household getting through 50 bacon sandwiches a year. It is  little wonder that a spokesman for the British Pig Executive said:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The industry is close to meltdown; it has had its  share of difficulties in the past but never anything on this scale and this  suddenly&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Increased grain prices have consequences far beyond  the obvious, and, if unchecked, they have the potential to cause problems for  farmers, consumers and even the Government, due to increased food prices and inflationary pressures in the economy. The  Government must not ignore the situation and must intervene to stabilise grain prices, prevent food prices from  increasing any further and prevent a  bad situation from getting worse.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  I am not a livestock farmer, a grain farmer  or a &ldquo;farmer all the same&rdquo;, whatever that means. However, as Members can  see, I do help to contribute to the consumption of those 50 bacon sandwiches a  year. In fact, I am well above the average for bacon sandwich consumption. I do  my bit for the rural part of my constituency with great gusto.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Like Sean Neeson, I have concerns about any call to distort  the market by asking the Minister to consider further subsidies for the farming  industry. That cannot be sustained in the long run. Although there may be a case for short-term intervention, the flavour of  the DUP amendment is to take away from the subsidy aspect of the issue.  The amendment is designed to look towards the long term and see how we can  exploit our climate, and research into new  crops, to try to address the problem that we currently face.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>: We farmers do not want subsidies.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  I am referring to the motion, which calls for &ldquo;intervention&rdquo;. I accept that  that intervention might only be short-term.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As other Members have said, one of the reasons why we must be careful is that the industry faces  inter&shy;national pressures. Regardless of what the Minister does, those  cannot be resisted. There is increased demand for food in China and India, and we have no control over  changing weather conditions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As the Assembly may be aware, I won an award from the Green  Party last year, and this is the start of my  bid to win it again in 2008. The Green Party circulates cards saying  that because of global warming we must find new ways to generate fuel and  suggests that we grow crops to convert to ethanol. Despite calls made in the House  today, if we use agricultural land to grow crops to turn into fuel, the impact  will be that supply will not keep up with demand.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members are aware of the increases in prices, and I do not  have time to go over that again. However, the amount of grain required to be  converted to ethanol to fill up my car fortnightly would, in a year, amount to  enough to feed an entire African village. That is the impact of following the  green lobby&rsquo;s route. Europe is now setting us  targets that state that, by 2020, biofuels must account for 10% of fuel used  for transport. If we meet that target, 40% of agricultural land in Europe will be used to grow crops &mdash; not to eat, but to  power cars and lorries. Globally, there will be huge shortages. We must be  aware of those consequences before blindly following the green lobby, which  seems to have captivated everyone.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Biofuels are not environmentally friendly anyway, because  producing them means cutting down forests, and in doing so, it becomes more  difficult to absorb CO2 emissions. Ethanol produces about 70% of the CO2  emissions of ordinary petrol, so that measure will not lead to a significant  reduction in emissions. If the Minister must intervene in the short term to  deal with grain shortages, then so be it. However, if there is any point to  this debate, the House must remember that when it makes choices, those measures  that appear innocuous at the time will have greater consequences and will lead  to the kind of problems that have been highlighted.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>: I  share the concerns expressed by most other Members. This is a unique situation;  oil prices in the world market are going through the roof, and the price of  heating oil is unsustainable. We will have to use our agricultural land to produce  fuel for heating.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those of us on the Committee for Agriculture and Rural  Development know that the red meat industry is going through a difficult  period. Farming is based on economics, and we cannot expect farmers to produce  food for no money. If farmers discover that huge profits can be made by growing  grain, they will cease to keep cattle and sheep, and the sight that we  traditionally associate with the countryside &mdash; farm animals in fields &mdash; will  disappear, because farmers will simply grow crops for the biofuel industry.  That would be a very sad road for our agricultural industry to take. Instead of  a food-production industry, it would, in essence, become a biofuel industry  that produces fuel for home heating, and to power cars and public transport.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It would be a great waste if the grain that could be  produced and that should be milled for bread to feed people went instead into  some form of fuel. That would be a great waste of the land.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, our Minister has no control whatsoever over the  price of oil. Does she have any control over what farmers decide to do with  their land? Perhaps it is the case that a big business bank manager comes to  talk to the farmer after he has lost so much money, to suggest that there is  more money in growing crops, and offering a loan for growing crops but no more  money for animals.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This is a serious situation in which the entire agriculture  industry finds itself. Also, it is not just a problem facing us here: it is  worldwide. I am keen to hear suggestions as to how the Minister and the  Assembly are going to tackle the problem. I support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  This topic is of huge importance to everyone in this country but it is one that  may not, perhaps, be as immediately obvious to consumers as to the farmers and  food producers of Northern Ireland. In fact, were you to go into any high  street across Northern    Ireland and ask the average shopper what  they thought of the crisis in grain provision, they would probably just give  you a blank stare. The truth is that producers and consumers across Northern Ireland  are going to pay &mdash; quite literally &mdash; for the current shortage in grain supply.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the past, a rise of &pound;20 per ton over a year was  considered high. We now have a situation whereby prices have risen by &pound;20 in  one day. Those costs are now being filtered down to the consumer, who will see  the price of food increase substantially in the next year. One major concern  about the provision of grain is the effort  being made in many countries to provide incentives for farmers to  diversify into the field of biofuels. At a time when grain prices were low and  biofuels were being trumpeted as a sustainable and environmentally-friendly  alternative to fossil fuels, the associated incentives proved very successful,  not least in the USA.  Thus a situation developed whereby grain that was once produced for the  agriculture industry is now going into the fuel industry. As Americans say; the  grain is no longer going into bullocks but into Buicks.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The clincher in all this is that scientific studies into  the use of biofuels have proved that they are not really any better than fossil  fuels. Biofuels have therefore little or no positive environmental impact; and,  the drive to divert grain for this use has contributed to the current global  shortage of grain, forcing prices up and increasing the pressure on farm  businesses that are already struggling to remain financially viable.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The EU has targets for the production of grain for  biofuels, aiming for between one sixth and one quarter of all arable land to be used for the production of biofuels by  2020. There has even been talk of that figure being doubled to between one  third and one half of all land. At present, we are not even close to meeting  the initial target yet we are faced with huge problems in the supply of grain  to the agriculture industry. Just imagine what it would be like if the EU got  its way.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There has been talk of issuing incentives for farmers to  produce as much grain as possible to meet world demand. The EU tried that  strategy before and created all sorts of problems &mdash; butter mountains and suchlike.  Before adopting a similar initiative, we would need to be sure that it would be  implemented in such a way so as to address the problems without creating new  ones. Inevitably, there would be a negative impact on the environment, with  extra land having to be used for grain production. In recent years, when the  industry has been under huge pressure, many farmers have taken advantage of  Government grants to transform land into areas of conservation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The prices of grain are so high that the only reason that a  farmer would persist with conservation measures would be out of the goodness of  his heart. That would mean working at a loss, and it would be a difficult  decision for any businessman.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Another option to consider is the use of new biotech  varieties of grain, which could be used to maximise output from available land.  The bottom line is that the agrifood industry is worth some &pound;2&middot;5 billion a year  to the Northern Ireland  economy and employs around 80,000 people &mdash; 15% of the workforce. Those issues  must be addressed, and I look forward to hearing the Minister&rsquo;s response.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  All Members are aware of the importance of grain not only in food but in  alcohol production; those of us who have a whisky will be aware of its use in  alcohol production, and we are also aware of its use as vehicle fuel.  Consequently, the current severe grain shortage in Europe will affect not only  farmers seeking to feed their livestock &mdash; and issue to which Members have  referred &mdash; but every person in the Province as supermarket prices rise on bread  and meat products, and other items that they may not even have considered. Feed  grains have risen in price faster than petrol and, like fossil fuels, are set  to redefine their supply chains.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Farmers, meat processors, enzyme makers and even fossil  fuel companies will have their world redefined by trends that are now reshaping  the feed grain sector. There is a variety of factors behind those trends, such  as the heatwave of 2003 during which Europe  bore the brunt of rising temperatures. That record-breaking heatwave claimed  35,000 lives in eight countries and withered grain harvests in almost every  European country, from France  in the west to Ukraine  in the east. The resulting reduction of some 30 million tons in Europe&rsquo;s grain  production was equal to half the entire US wheat harvest. That reduction,  coupled with the fact that fewer farmers are growing grain, means that Europe has gone from being a major grain exporter to  being an importer. Anyone in that business knows that when need rises, the  price rises with it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That is the situation  in which farmers in the Province currently find themselves. For that  reason, I support the amendment and ask the  Department and the Minister to step in to put support mechanisms in  place that will head off the crisis. This issue affects not only my  constituency of Strangford but all constituencies across the Province. The  agriculture sector is the biggest employer in Strangford &mdash; and, indeed, in the  Province &mdash; and I ask for something more than mere scratchings of heads and  wringing of hands for people in that sector. A huge number of people depend on  the Minister and the Department to respond positively.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have a meat-supply business and I have grass-roots &mdash;  excuse the pun &mdash; experience of the adverse effects that are already being felt  Province-wide. I have spoken to butchers and farmers who have expressed their  concerns over the price of grain and the fact that they cannot keep up with it.  Last week, some farmers told me that they are not feeding any grain at all to  their cattle, sheep or lambs. They are putting their animals out in the grass  early, and we all know there is not much growth in the grass. What effect will  that have on the businesses of those farmers? They are caught between a rock  and a hard place.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some people suggest that the USA  is controlling grain exportation throughout North and South America purposely,  and that that has a tangible effect on Europe.  However, it is beyond my powers to fight that battle, and I will leave it to  the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development to respond to that issue. A  spokesman for the US Grains Council has said that Europe  has a real problem with grain supplies. We are hearing that:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;importers in Europe  were indicating that they will need 17 to 18 million metric tons of feed grains  in 2008.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is an indication of how bad the situation is.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If the problem is recognised in the US, undoubtedly  the issue will have been flagged up long before now. I put it to the Minister  that it is time for something to be done.  She is held in high esteem because of her positive response to the  recent outbreak of bluetongue, and today I exhort her to respond to the  problems facing the grain industry and those farmers who depend on grain to  feed their cattle, sheep and lambs. The lifting of EU import duties and tariffs  is not enough to offset the problem, and bigger steps must be taken quickly  before things get out of hand.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Farmers are in dire need of support, and it is vitally  important that the Assembly provides that support across the Province. The  Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development must show that she is doing all  she can to help farmers buy grain at a reasonable price &mdash; one that will not  boost the price to the meat supplier, who will then boost the price to the  butcher, who will, in turn, boost the price to the consumer.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Grain products are not luxuries; they are necessities. It  is not an offer of optional Government assistance that is needed; it is an  obligation by the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, which it  must fulfil while it can, to improve the lives of the people &mdash; and that  includes everyone in this House &mdash; who depend  on the agriculture sector. I support the amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The business on the Order Paper will not be disposed of by 6.00 pm.  Therefore, in accordance with Standing Order 10(3), I will allow business to continue until it is completed or  until 7.00 pm.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development (Ms Gildernew)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a  LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank Mr Savage and Mr Elliott for raising this issue  today. I also want to put on record my appreciation of Mr Savage&rsquo;s opening  remarks. The matter merits debate since it is clearly very important for people  involved in agriculture, especially in the intensive sectors, who rely on  grain. I share the concerns raised by Mr Savage, and other Members. Before  dealing with the specific points that have been raised, I will set out some of  the background to the current grain scarcity and the issues relating to support  in the intensive production sector.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We have heard how, globally, agriculture has experienced a  rapidly growing demand for grain and a significant rise in prices. That has  been driven by growing demand for biofuels; expanding demand in the world  economy, and falling stocks of most types of grain. I share the view of other  Members that bio-ethanol is not the solution to all of our problems. If further  money were spent on developing wind and wave energy, those sources would  provide a more sustainable way of meeting our energy needs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The droughts in Australia  and the States coupled with poor growing conditions in Europe  have resulted in world grain reserves reaching a record low; and over the last  three years, there has been a 159% rise in the price of wheat. The difficulties  being encountered by the intensive sector are as a direct consequence of the  global rise in cereal and protein prices.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am very mindful, too, of the challenges facing the pig  sector. The average market price for finished clean pigs over the 2007 calendar  year fluctuated between 101&middot;35p and 96&middot;17p per kg dead weight, while the feed  cost per finished clean pig rose from &pound;57&middot;22 to &pound;73&middot;84. Those figures indicate  clearly that this is a difficult time for the pig sector. My Department is  providing substantial resources at farm level to aid compliance with the  environmental restrictions, thus demonstrating our commitment to the future of  a sustainable pig industry. Support is also being provided to producers under  integrated pollution prevention and control legislation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The poultry sector in  the North has also been affected by the rising costs of feedstuff. Feed  costs amount to 66% of the total production costs for broiler chickens, and  about 60% of egg production costs. That has created significant challenges for  the sector, in addition to the pressures that have been created by importing  from countries whose agriculture sectors operate under different standards and  circumstances.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, many primary producers have been shielded from the  market due to the vertical integration model that is widely used in poultry  businesses. Due to the nature of contracts between poultry producers and  processors, and the forward-buying policies employed by them, the impact of  increased feed costs on primary producers has been less significant. It is  encouraging, though, to note that egg prices have risen in the past few months  to take account of those higher input costs. Through innovation and new product  development, the poultry processing sector works hard to add value and stay  ahead of the competition in what is a very aggressive market.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased to say that the dairy sector, which has  experienced a 28% rise in milk prices, is in a relatively strong position to  deal with the cereals crisis. Although the dairy sector uses concentrates as a  feeding supplement, it is a grass-based enterprise, and the rise in milk prices  has helped to cushion the effects of increasing concentrate prices.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although the dairy sector is doing well, we have already  heard from a number of Members that the red meat sector is facing significant  challenges. The decoupling of subsidies has started to bring home the sector&rsquo;s  unprofitability at current market prices. In an unprecedented step, key  stakeholders from the sector worked with the Government to establish the Red  Meat Industry Task Force; with the objective of assessing the industry&rsquo;s  position and developing options for the future. That work resulted, as Members  will know, in the Red Meat Industry Task Force report, which was published in  October 2007. It clearly indicates the serious challenges facing the beef and  lamb sectors.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Action to address those challenges is now under way, and I  assure Members that DARD, in partnership with the industry, will play a full  part in that process. The report points out a range of challenges to which the  industry must respond positively.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">6.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although prices have risen slightly over the past couple of  months, there do not appear to be any major price rises around the corner. I  have no influence over retail prices; however, in my opinion, production cost  increases cannot be borne by the primary producer. The rest of the supply  chain, including the consumer, must also bear part of that burden. The feed  price and cost imbalance throughout the industry cannot persist, and, when  European production falls in response to those pressures, there will be an  EU-wide adjustment in intensive production sector prices. That represents the  only long-term and sustainable solution to the problem of higher feed-input  costs, which seems destined to persist. In the meantime, Mr Clarke&rsquo;s suggestion  about using co-operatives and collective buying power whenever possible in  order to keep prices down is certainly of value.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In support of the local industry, in recent months, I have  personally engaged in several initiatives. I met with Ministers Ruane and  McGimpsey in order to consider developing  and expanding local food-sourcing initiatives  in the education and health sectors. In addition, I have also discussed  with my colleagues the matter of increased public procurement of local produce,  and I am working with the UFU in an attempt to get through the current  difficulties.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Given the rising cost of feed prices, I wrote to every  supermarket expressing my concern about producer level returns, and I am aware there has been a subsequent rise  in some retail prices. Hopefully, those increased returns will work back  through the supply chain to improve the farmgate price.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am also pleased by the supermarkets&rsquo; positive response to  the industry&rsquo;s collective initiative to identify and promote locally produced  food through the Good Food is in Our Nature campaign. Although he is not here,  I hope that Sammy Wilson is taking cognisance of that; if he buys locally  produced bacon, his 50 bacon sandwiches a week will certainly help.<span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Concerning support for the pig sector, following a meeting  with representatives of that sector, including some from the Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union, I wrote to the Secretary of State for Environment,  Food and Rural Affairs in order to urge support for the reintroduction of  pig-sector export refunds. I also wrote to Mary Coughlan TD about that matter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although the European Commission is extremely reluctant to  use export refunds &mdash; and it takes a great deal of pressure from EU member  states to persuade it to act &mdash; under such pressure, export refunds were  introduced. Therefore, further export refund increases would be difficult to achieve. Nevertheless, the Depart&shy;ment,  through Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (AFBI),  continues to support research and development work, which provides an  important science and expertise base.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The recently established Pig ReGen Ltd is an additional  resource to help to improve the production and quality of pigs here.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Concerning the red-meat sector, my Department is publicly  committed to working with those people who want to stay in the industry and  secure a more viable future, and we will also help people who wish to seek  other opportunities. In addition, we will encourage producers to develop their  businesses through training, benchmarking and adopting the latest technology. I  am fully engaged in the taskforce&rsquo;s work to develop constructive relationships  across the supply chain, and I will personally continue to engage with all  parts of that chain.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department is also considering options that support  farmers who choose to diversify or seek other opportunities. Such options will  be supported by the rural development programme, which I announced in summer  2007. Options include a bespoke programme for farming families in the red-meat  sector, involving intense and targeted  training, mentoring and information sessions, all of which are designed  to assist farmers in making the right choice in a difficult situation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My Department continues to support the intensive production  sector in every way possible. The College of Agriculture, Food and Rural  Enterprise (CAFRE) provides a comprehensive range of education and training  programmes for producers and processors, and DARD&rsquo;s  supply chain development branch helps groups of farmers to work together  with industry partners in order to improve returns and, if diversification is  the desired course of action, to consider potential options. My Department also  provides support through its new entrants scheme, which can subsidise loans in  order to facilitate restructuring or investment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">EU funding will be available in order to develop and expand  profitable and sustainable markets and to encourage better co-operation and  communication between all food-industry sectors. That funding will be delivered  under axis 1 of the rural development programme, specifically the agricultural  and forestry processing and marketing grant scheme and the supply chain  development programme.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The agricultural  marketing development grant scheme is scheduled to open in the summer  and will assist with developing marketing  capabilities. Although the provision of further financial support  through the state aid route is worth considering, the problem with state aid is  that, in the short time frame, it would not  provide immediate relief to producers. It is more likely that a  rebalancing of the market would have taken place before such a measure could  achieve any significant impact.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am aware that France has been able to provide  financial support to producers using de minimis state aid, which has recently  been increased to allow a payment of up to  &euro;7,500 per producer over a three-year period without the need to secure  state aid approval. However, that de minimis aid, which comes in the form of  subsidised loans, is permitted only if the gross grant equivalent has been  calculated on the basis of market interest rates prevailing at the time of the  grant. I have concerns about encouraging producers to get into increased debt, using borrowed money at a  reduced rate to subsidise continued production. Members will appreciate  &mdash; and many have noted today &mdash; that I am not in a position to provide further  direct financial support without EU Commission approval.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The current global grain market situation and reforms to  the CAP mean that there are limited policy tools available to the commission to  influence the world, or, indeed EU, grain price. Current intervention stocks are very small, and those have all been  committed for sale. However, set-aside has been reduced to zero, and  very early indications would suggest that EU grain production will increase this year, although I appreciate that  that will take some time to have an impact and that weather conditions will be  crucial to the level of future production. I must point out that the provision  for intervention support operates at EU level and is not in the power of the  Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Moving on to the amendment, I am aware of the long delays  in Brussels in  the authorisation of genetically modified food and feed varieties for import  growing and processing in the EC. I know that grain exporters and importers  have been reluctant to bring feed supplies into Europe  since it is unlawful to import an unauthorised GM variety into the EC &mdash; even if  it is in tiny traces of accidental contamination in a large consignment of grain.  Although the authorisation, in October 2007, for the import of Herculex and two  other types of GM maize and a type of sugar beet has helped supply, there  remains a backlog of applications with the  EC. The problems of those delays, which many Members have mentioned,  will not be easily resolved.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As regards the Commission speeding up approval for GM products, it is also important that the  Commission carefully considers each application as it must take into  account human health concerns. I will continue to watch developments carefully  in that area. It is for the industry to decide whether it chooses to use GM  products that are currently available in the EU. To date, very few in the  industry have chosen to do so, due to the dangers of cross-contamination and a  consumer desire for products not fed on GM produce. Therefore a speeded-up  process at the Commission may not solve that problem. Furthermore, a number of  retailers, such as Tesco and Sainsbury&rsquo;s, have made a commitment to use non-GM  products in their own-brand products. So there is a desire, driven by  consumers, to exclude GM varieties from food.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Locally, the Food Standards Agency leads on the aspects of  GM, and DOE is involved where there are environmental considerations. I have  met senior executives from the major supermarkets and encouraged them to take  into account the rising input costs faced by producers and processors, and to  increase the amount of produce sourced here. I am very concerned about the  current situation facing the intensive-production sectors. I would like to take  the action necessary to influence the cereals or the intensive-production  markets, but we are a very small regional player in a very large EU market,  and, as such, cannot significantly influence the markets at EU level. Although  I cannot provide any additional funding, my Department will assist in whatever  way it can to help producers develop new production systems for the  intensive-production sector, with a view to satisfying the demands of, or need  for, new market opportunities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, further subsidy, even in the short term,  will not be practical or realistic; however, I will certainly consider any  suggestions the intensive-production sectors, or my colleagues, have to offer  that might ease the situation facing the pig,  meat and poultry sectors. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Irwin</strong>: I  thank Members for bringing the matter to  the House today, and I declare an interest as a farmer.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Grain scarcity is fast becoming a major problem for an already struggling agricultural industry. The  intensive-production sector is hit hardest, which is an issue that has  been flagged up to me in recent times by beef, pork and poultry producers. On  each occasion the message is the same: farmers cannot continue to produce the  product if production costs outweigh the farm-gate prices.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Not enough grain is produced in Northern   Ireland, mainland Britain  and the Republic   of Ireland to satisfy  domestic demands. We all rely heavily on imports. It is a vicious circle. For a  country the size of the United    Kingdom, the grain-scarcity issue is  worrying.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On a world scale, with the West trying to find alternative  sources for fuel, the major fuel producers are taking a keener interest in the  use of industrial corn for the production of ethanol. Replacing the millions of  hectares normally used for the production of edible corn had devastating  consequences in Mexico,  as the people witnessed a 400% increase in the price of corn-related  foodstuffs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Grain producers such as  Kazakhstan, Russia, Argentina  and Mexico  have curbed exports as a result of internal political pressure. The people in  those countries could not afford the food that was derived from the grain that  they produced, as domestic supply was so tight. Such issues have contributed to  the massive drop in the worldwide availability of grain.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Europe used to be a major  grain exporter, but it is now reported as requiring 18 million tons of grain this year. Changing from a net exporter to a net  importer has further reduced the list of countries that can be relied upon  to supply the rest of the world with grain. That, coupled with unfavourable  weather conditions that restricted supply in Australia  and Canada  &mdash; two major exporters &mdash; will result in a crisis. That is a far cry from farmers  having to put a percentage of their land into set-aside to curb production.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although in Northern    Ireland we have little control over the grain prices and supply, the effects are  extremely serious. Intervention measures could be taken to help our  industry cope in the short term. Such measures would be welcomed; ultimately,  however, they will not address the underlying issues that have led to grain  shortages and soaring prices.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The agreement of the EU to import a larger range of biotech  crops intended for animal feeds would be a positive step forward that would  immediately help farmers. Such crops are being grown on an increasing scale in America, and  would go some way to addressing the grain shortage.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although the importation of many of those crops into Europe is not permitted, meat is allowed to be imported  from countries that use biotech crops in meat production. Such meat imports are  cheaper than the meat that our farmers can produce; therefore, they undercut  and further destabilise our own industry. That is a disgraceful situation, and  it is a total contradiction by the decision-makers in Europe.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The grain shortage has led to a rise in the prices of food  in supermarkets. However, the rise in prices on the shelf is not reflected in  the price that farmers receive. Farmers bear  the brunt of increasing production costs. That situation cannot continue  indefinitely.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">An increase in the price that farmers receive for their  product would go some way in lessening the burden on our industry. The EU must  realise that approving cheap-meat imports is badly crippling our industry. Our  farmers are being undercut by countries such  as Thailand and Brazil, where  production standards and costs are much lower.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The serious situation that faces the pig industry will be  highlighted tomorrow when the National Pig Association converges on Downing  Street to hand in a petition, signed by 10,000 people, that calls for producers  to receive a fair amount for their products, or  face the consequences &mdash; the collapse of the industry. The Minister would  do well to add her voice to that protest.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the Minister to take those matters seriously and to  work to help our industry cope in what is a worrying time. Action that will  sustain the industry in the longer term is required.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I call on the House to  support the motion as amended.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">6.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I place on record my thanks to all those who participated in the debate on this  serious issue. I am particularly grateful to  the Minister for her response. The Ulster Unionist Party is acutely  aware of the limitations on what can be done.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The two main issues received significant mention during the  debate. The first issue is the grain shortage and how much that costs. Members  have talked at great length, and I will not rehash the arguments about how much  land has been converted from producing grain for food to producing biofuel.  That has led to the shortage of grain to which Members referred.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Everyone knows that the US has always kept a three-month  supply of grain in storage, but it now has only one month at the most. Were  something to happen to grain production, within that time it would cause a  shortage of grain in most areas of the world. The world relies heavily on the  production of grain in the US  and South America.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly may be able to have some impact on the second  issue, which is the cost of the farmers&rsquo; end product. I must declare an  interest, as I am a farmer and a livestock producer. The days of cheap food in Northern Ireland  are over, and people must get their heads round the new situation. For years,  cheap food has been produced in, or imported into, Northern Ireland. Those days, or at  least the days when such cheap food was also a quality product, are over.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">People may still be able to buy cheap imported products from  countries whose standards are not the same as those in Northern Ireland.  Farmers are fed up with having to adhere to the high standards of food  production in Northern    Ireland. If meeting those standards gave  their products a distinct and significant advantage over others on supermarket  shelves, they would not mind.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  Is the Member aware that, over the past month or six weeks, the price of beef  in the shops has increased by 60p a kilogram? Surely that increase should be  passed on to farmers.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I agree with the Member for Strangford that farmers should receive that  increase, but they do not &mdash; or certainly not all of it. Farmers have been  highlighting that problem for years. There is much too high a discrepancy  between the price that consumers pay in supermarkets, the amount that the  processor gets and how much the primary producer &mdash; the farmer &mdash; receives.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am not sure whether legislation, or authority from Europe, would be required, but I ask the Minister to act  on food labelling. If imported products are not up to the same standard as  those produced in Northern    Ireland, the consumer must be informed. The  difficulty is that they are not and, therefore, a proper labelling regime is  required. Otherwise, the situation will not be sustainable for local farmers.  Too many are going out of business: in a few years, no local produce will even  be available. That is the main basis of my argument.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will go through a few issues that Members raised. Many  Members highlighted similar issues. I thank my colleague, the proposer of the  motion, George Savage, who described at  length and in graphic detail the severe worldwide shortage of grain. He illustrated the shortage with  specific evidence and highlighted the problems.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There was an intervention from Sammy Wilson, who talked  about environmentalists who want to provide alternative fuels but who are  having the opposite effect on the environment, whereby there will probably be  an increase in food miles and a reduction in overall food production.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The proposer of the amendment, Allan Bresland, highlighted  how the large supermarkets drive down the price of products.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">He indicated that the amendment is designed to enhance the  motion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Willie Clarke of Sinn F&eacute;in put out his stall at the start  of his contribution by explaining that his party is opposed to the growing of genetically modified products in Northern Ireland. I am not aware  that any genetically modified products are being grown in Northern Ireland,  or that there is the intention to do so in the near future. Mr Clarke also  highlighted the global demands for food, specifically for grain products.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">P J Bradley pointed out that farmers live in a world of environmentalists and that environmentalist  pressure is being put on every Government throughout the world. He also  touched on the thorny issue of genetically modified food. Sean Neeson mentioned  that grain producers have recorded the highest production for years; perhaps  the highest production that some regions have ever seen, which almost &mdash; excuse  the pun &mdash; goes against the grain of the debate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Trevor Clarke highlighted the amendment and the slow  procedure that exists in the EU for the approval of new varieties of crops from  the United States  and, indeed, elsewhere. Billy Armstrong suggested some options to the Minister. He also mentioned the 50 bacon  sandwiches that are consumed by each household every year. I wonder how much of  that which is consumed is locally produced. That is a serious point, because  that is one of the current downfalls. I assume that quite a lot of that product  is imported.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I regret that Sammy Wilson is not in the Chamber at  present. He discussed the intervention that is suggested in the motion. I want  to assure Sammy and others in the Chamber that the motion does not call for  subsidies or for further direct payments.  It aims for a fair balance. Action can be taken that does not involve  direct payments being made to farmers, a few of which I have highlighted:  labelling; better supermarket prices; and some type of ombudsman. A report that  was published just two weeks ago suggested that the food industry should have  an ombudsman to ensure that a fair price for products is realised, from  retailers right back to primary producers. Such an ombudsman is required. If  that were in place, it would certainly improve the situation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Thomas Burns indicated that the problem exists worldwide &mdash;  which all Members accept. The problem is not local to Northern Ireland,  but exists throughout the world. Mrs Iris Robinson talked about the EU targets  for biofuels. She indicated that Northern Ireland is nowhere near  meeting those targets. That is quite clear. Therefore, the Assembly must strike  a balance between growing biofuels and growing crops for food.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Jim Shannon highlighted the amount of grain that is used in  the production of whisky. However, as he did not declare an interest, I do not  know where he stands on that matter. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span><span class="B3BodyTextItalicChar"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister, quite rightly, referred to feed costs in the intensive production sector, particularly that of pigs and poultry, in Northern Ireland.  Clearly, the Assembly must get a handle on  the situation. She also referred to the Red Meat Industry Task Force. I  am pleased that the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development has  organised and will host a seminar next week that will include a range of people  from throughout the entire industry, such as retailers, consumers, super&shy;markets,  processors and farmers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">William Irwin discussed the authorisation of grain from Europe, and the amendment. I hope that my understanding  of the amendment is correct &mdash; that it does not seek to enforce the manufacture  of genetically modified products in Northern Ireland. Those products are coming in anyway, folks. The motion and  amendment simply aim to speed up the approval process. They call on the EU to speed up the process and to allow  Northern Ireland  the same opportunities as the rest of the world.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><span class="Italic">Question</span>, That the amendment be  made, <span class="Italic">put and agreed to</span>.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><span class="Italic">Main Question</span>, as amended, <span class="Italic">put and agreed to.</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes with concern the scarcity of grain  within Europe, which is having a detrimental effect on the profits of the  production sector, as a result of higher grain prices; and calls on the  Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development to provide intervention support  to the intensive production sector that relies upon grain, and to lobby the  European Union on the approval of new biotech varieties.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Motion made:</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">That the Assembly do now adjourn. &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Mr Deputy Speaker]</span><strong><span style="text-transform:uppercase; font-size:12.0pt; font-style:normal; "> </span></strong></p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="9"></a>Adjournment</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Traffic Pollution in Dungiven</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind Members that the proposer of the debate will have 10  minutes to speak. All other Members who wish to speak will have three minutes.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I  am conscious of the time constraints, so I will try to deliver my speech a lot  faster than the traffic goes through Dungiven.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members know that for many years money that was intended  for the development of infrastructure &mdash; whether road or rail &mdash; was diverted to  security and compensation claims. Hopefully, that is now part of history.  However, what is not part of history is the legacy of neglect that has been  left behind and the difficulties in dealing with that. The pieces must be  picked up &mdash; that is the expectation of the people who supported the peace package.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">One of the most shameful examples of neglect is the  situation that the people of Dungiven find themselves in. How would anyone like  to live in what is, officially, the most polluted town on these islands? That  pollution is being caused by the huge volume of traffic, much of which consists  of heavy-goods vehicles, that goes through the town each day because there is  no bypass and no hope of one in the immediate future. In the short term, it  seems that there is no money to carry out the work that is required to free the  people &mdash; particularly the young and elderly &mdash; from the health hazards being  created by carbon dioxide and the other harmful pollutants that are emitted by  the daily-increasing traffic.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Programme for Government is offering the people of Dungiven  no hope for a solution during the lifetime of this mandate and, according to  the Minister for Regional Development, they will have to wait for years to get  what is rightfully theirs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members must acknowledge the injustices and neglect of the  past, and begin from there. A decent, modern road from Derry to Belfast is required &mdash; one  that does not ruin people&rsquo;s health. Professionals have measured and quantified  the pollution and have stated that it is ruining the health of local people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Since December 1997, each local authority in the UK has carried  out a review and assessment of air quality  in its area. That involves measuring air pollution and trying to predict  how it will change in the next few years. The aim of the review is to ensure  that national air-quality objectives are achieved. Therefore, if a local  authority finds an area in which the objectives are not likely to be achieved,  it must declare it an air-quality management area. It could be an area  comprising one or two streets or greater. The local authority will then put  together a local air-quality action plan.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The problem for the people of Dungiven and Limavady Borough  Council is that they have no control over the causes of the build-up of  nitrogen dioxide in the town, particularly at its lower end. The dogs in the  street know that the only solution is to take the traffic away from the town  centre, where a large number of families, young, not so young and elderly are  living.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are no alternative routes for the traffic that goes  through Dungiven. Any changes in traffic management will have little or no  impact on the traffic problems in the town. The Department for Regional  Development is responsible for the traffic problem, and has known about it for  a considerable number of years &mdash; long before the current Minister, I concede &mdash;  and is aware that it has not gone away.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Four years ago, Limavady Borough Council met direct rule  Minister, John Spellar, who accepted all the arguments in favour for a bypass  for Dungiven and said that the only reason for the delay was &mdash; of course &mdash;  money. He accepted that Dungiven was the only town on the route between Belfast and Derry where  pollution problems, congestion problems, parking problems and road-safety  difficulties made action imperative.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Motions and references  have been made at Limavady Borough  Council for 20 &mdash; some would say 30 &mdash; years. The council agreed that  after the Limavady bypass, the Dungiven and  Ballykelly bypasses were urgent priorities. When that decision was taken  in 2006, the number of vehicles going through the town each day was  approximately 14,000 &mdash; and, as we all know, that number is rising dramatically.  Congestion is bad most of the time, but particularly on Friday afternoons.  Pedestrian safety is being compromised by the traffic.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In situations such as  this, there is a tendency to blame past failures, which is  understandable: some people might say that Willie Ross was MP for the area and was more interested in bypassing Dungiven than  actually getting a bypass for the town. Perhaps that is unfair because  he is no longer an elected representative.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There were many flamboyant direct rule Ministers, who loved  the power and glory of presiding over important events but did precious little  to put infrastructure on the ground. In the long years of direct rule, I doubt  if any British Minister spent time in Dungiven &mdash; maybe someone will correct me.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">They may have, but they did not stay long enough to  breathe in the nitrogen dioxide or experience the noise of the heavy vehicles.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">6.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In fairness, we got the  Toome and Limavady bypasses during  the two and a half years of the previous Assembly, and it was assumed  that the Dungiven bypass would be next. Given the continuous deterioration of  air quality over recent years, it seemed inevitable that the force-feeding of  pollution would be brought to a snappy end, but,  unfortunately, that has not happened. The old adage, &ldquo;live horse and you  will get grass&rdquo;, comes to mind.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A report drawn up by consultants in October 2004 made  particular reference to noise levels, vibration and poisonous gases in  Dungiven. The report stated that noise levels were significantly higher as a  direct result of uneven speeds or &mdash; I dare suggest &mdash; no speed at all. Members  may be interested to know that noise nuisance is described by the World Health  Organization as:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;a feeling of displeasure evoked by noise.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Vibration is described as:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;slow frequency disturbance producing physical  movements in buildings or occupants.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Members will not be surprised to hear that all  three of those environmental problems &mdash; pollution, noise and vibration &mdash; are  present in Dungiven, and all are offensive to the people who have put up with  them day and daily. Those problems must be managed. A bypass, now and not  later, is the only way in which that can be done successfully.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Several environmental health reports over the past three  years have highlighted Dungiven as having a serious problem with nitrogen  dioxide. A special study carried out between July and December 2004 indicated  clearly that the risk to health was at an elevated level in Main Street. It is hard to understand why  that did not alert the Department for Regional Development to get its finger  out and begin serious discussions about funding a bypass. Surely the Minister  of Finance and Personnel, Peter Robinson, was aware that there was a special  problem in the north-west, which was cutting around eight months off the lives  of the residents in at least 317 properties in the town. Let us hope that the  Minister for Regional Development was not shafted by the Finance Minister when  it comes to the money to build the all-important bypass. There is a growing  impatience and a feeling of rejection in Dungiven that its problem has not been  taken seriously enough to include the capital cost of the bypass.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As far back as 2003, the then Minister John Spellar MP &mdash;  clearly under pressure &mdash; referred to the Dungiven bypass. He said:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I want to reflect carefully on the scope for  including the Dungiven bypass in the 10-year Forward Planning Schedule for  strategic road improvement schemes&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is quite a phrase.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That, of course, effectively condemned the people of  Dungiven to another decade of forced poisoning. After the dust settled, most  people accepted that they had been sold a pup. The Minister went further in his  con job by suggesting that the bypass:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;could be achieved by extending slightly the period of  the plan to 2014.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Since then, we have heard various dates mentioned  but, sadly, none of them fall within the lifetime of this Assembly. That is  regrettable, unacceptable, and grossly unfair, because it is playing with  people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I see it, future plans are like pieces of elastic &mdash; they  can be stretched ever further, but they will snap eventually. The patience of  the people of Dungiven is at snapping point. They want action from the  Assembly, not promises that can be broken by any future Assembly, and they want  it now. They are crying out for the support of the Assembly and are grateful  for the cross-community support that the Adjournment debate has attracted.  Gregory Campbell has apologised for being unable to attend the debate.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>: I am pleased to speak in the debate. I have raised the issue of  the urgent need for a bypass in Dungiven with the Minister in a question for  written answer, I have spoken to community representatives from the town, and I  have sought to hasten the process of providing a resolution to the current  problems. However, as a fellow member of the Committee for Regional Development  and representative for East Londonderry, Mr  Dallat and I are aware of the statutory processes that are required  before a project of that nature can begin.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to see the construction of a bypass begin tomorrow  morning. That would alleviate the severe congestion and parking problems in the  town and, without doubt, greatly reduce the health consequences to the people  of Dungiven. However, everyone understands that quick fixes will not be  available or be of any genuine benefit. As a short-term measure, there have  been suggestions to divert traffic past Dungiven on to the A37 to ease the  problems until the proposed bypass is built.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister for Regional Development will be aware that I  have pointed out, on numerous occasions, the problems that exist on the A37 due  to the lack of progress on the Gortcorbies  climbing lane. A judgement must be made on the benefit of such a  diversion or even whether it would be followed by all motorists.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am fully aware that feelings run high on the issue, and I  take this opportunity to inform the Assembly and remind the Minister of the  constant pressure that is being brought to bear on the matter by Limavady  Borough Council, which is due to meet the Minister soon. However, I note that  the Sinn F&eacute;in Member who lives in the area has been so interested in the bypass  that he has tabled only one question to his party colleague on the matter since  devolution.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The serious traffic pollution in Dungiven has implications  for health. A report by the World Health Organization in 2003, entitled &lsquo;Health  Aspects of Air Pollution with Particulate Matter, Ozone and Nitrogen Dioxide&rsquo;,  states that:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Long-term exposure to current ambient PM  concentrations may lead to a marked reduction in life expectancy.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">If that does not bring home to us the dangers of  the traffic in Dungiven and its resultant air pollution, I do not know what  will. Is the Assembly prepared to let the problem continue? I sincerely hope  not.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We cannot tolerate a situation in which chest and heart  problems have been, are being, and will continue to be, caused by traffic  congestion in Dungiven. The health issues carry the most weight with me, and I  regard them as the most important reasons for reducing traffic pollution in  Dungiven. We cannot tolerate a situation in which people&rsquo;s health has suffered  due to the Department for Regional Development&rsquo;s inactivity under previous  Administrations. The people wanted, voted for and got their own Government in  the shape of this Assembly. Therefore it is up to us, as elected  representatives, to do the best that we can. Dungiven needs a bypass &mdash; no  argument.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I was dismayed that the Minister&rsquo;s written answer to a  question that Mr Durkan asked recently showed that that urgently needed project  has been pushed back for a further three years. Six months ago, the Minister  told me that the project was due to be completed in the latter part of the  regional strategic transport network transport plan, which ends in 2015. In his  answer to Mr Durkan, he said that it will be delivered in the lifetime of the  proposed investment strategy for 2008-18.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The need for a bypass is not in question. If the Minister  keeps putting it on the long finger, he will condemn more people to chest and  heart problems.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  I call on the Minister to address the issue.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brolly</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank my friend and colleague  John Dallat for bringing this topic to the House. I assure him that when the  internal combustion engine arrives in Kilrea, I will stand shoulder to shoulder  with him.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank Mr George Robinson for his support. If he had  bothered Conor Murphy about the Dungiven bypass as much as I have during the  past eight months, Conor would have hidden under the table when he saw George  coming.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I would like to give the House some impression of the  frustration experienced by people who live in Dungiven. I have a particular  interest in this topic as I am the only person in the Chamber who comes from  Dungiven. Two members of my family live very close to the most-affected area in  the town &mdash;Lower Main Street.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The move to bypass Dungiven began in 1965 under the old Limavady Rural District Council, which  George will remember, which, together with the urban council, became  Limavady Borough Council. When the council decided  that Dungiven should have a bypass there were objections, one of which  came from Mr Billy Ross because the bypass  would be close to his dwelling. That was an important aspect, although  he had good reasons for objecting, as the  area was of historic interest. I hope that the issue can be worked out.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Between 1965 and the 1980s there was pressure for a bypass  for Dungiven. Some residents disagreed about whether it would be a good thing  or not. If we were to ask them now, they would definitely be in favour of a  bypass.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the late 1980s, Paddy O&rsquo;Loughlin had his house knocked  down in preparation for work that was about to begin on the bypass. When, in  2001, I joined George Robinson on Limavady Borough Council, we spoke  continually, not only about the bypass but about the general conditions of roads around Limavady. Everyone from that  part of the north-west travels to Belfast  by way of Dungiven.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Whereas we had been promised a bypass for so many years, a  bypass was built at Toome. Toome had what  Dungiven had not: a facility for helping congestion, which was used successfully  for a good while. The Toome bypass was to be spectacular, with a bridge and all  that. I suppose that the direct rule Minister was keen on making spectacular  improvements before he went off home again. We all knew that, when it was  finished, the Toome bypass would move all the traffic to Dungiven, which would  become the next bottleneck. Toome was freed up and Dungiven became totally  congested. It was worse than congested, because we had no alternative but to  endure traffic travelling up and down Main    Street.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A Limavady bypass was also built at that time. George will  probably agree with me that it was ill-conceived, because Ballykelly was not  bypassed at the same time. Ballykelly is, by a long way, the worst part of the  Limavady to Coleraine route. Therefore, the Limavady bypass was not of any  great consequence, except that it was a blessing to those who lived in Linenhall Street,  which is a narrow street that would have suffered the same level of pollution  as we now suffer in Dungiven.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Soon after devolution, I wrote to Conor Murphy for the  first time &mdash; in that instance about congestion in Dungiven. I asked that the  proposed dualling not have any bearing on whether there should be a bypass at  Dungiven; that the bypass be considered a separate project; and that the  dualling eventually dovetail the bypass. However, Roads Service and its civil  engineers reported that that was not viable.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Mr Brolly, your time is up.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>:  I thank Mr John Dallat for securing this important debate. The issue greatly  concerns me, as it does all Members who have spoken. For that reason, I regret  that Mr Robinson became involved in scoring cheap, party political points: that  does this cause no good at all.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Dungiven&rsquo;s requirement for a bypass is now critical. As has  been mentioned on a number of occasions, the volume  of traffic through the town is extremely worrying. It has resulted in Dungiven&rsquo;s becoming perhaps  the most polluted town in the Province &mdash; an unwanted title.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is completely unacceptable, in this day and age, that the people of that County Londonderry town  should be forced to put up with dangerously high levels of pollution, as  a result of vehicle emissions. The health risks are immense.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In a recent study, Limavady Borough Council&rsquo;s environmental  health department recorded pollution levels in Main Street in Dungiven at 68 micrograms  per cubic metre of nitrogen dioxide. Since monitoring began in 2006, the average level has risen to 50 micro&shy;grams per  cubic metre. Experts in the field advise that a reading of 40 is &ldquo;hazardous&rdquo;.  Therefore, how much worse is a reading of 68? The situation is extremely  worrying. The Assembly cannot continue to tolerate the fact that people live  and work in a town in this Province that is an unsafe and unhealthy environment  for them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As recently as last month, the Minister for Regional  Development corresponded with Limavady Borough Council, when he announced the  next stage of the upgrade of the A6 road  from Londonderry to Dungiven, including  the Dungiven bypass. Civil engineers have been  appointed to examine options to enable a preferred route to be selected.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The route corridor for the scheme has already been selected. Consultants are examining a variety of  options in that corridor, and they plan to consult on them before summer  2008. After further detailed appraisal, the Department plans to announce the  preferred route for the new dual carriageway in the spring of 2009.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although I welcome those  moves to tackle the matter, the people of Dungiven should not have to  endure the dangerous threat of traffic pollution for another year.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">6.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Immediate action is  needed to deal with this problem. The issue cannot be put on the long  finger; it must be acted on immediately, and not at some notional date in the  future. During the course of the previous Assembly, a bypass was provided for  Limavady. That was greatly needed, and it was hoped that one would be provided  for Dungiven in due course. Unfortunately, that did not happen, but the talking  and the pondering continued.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The time for talking is over. Years have been wasted on  deliberations and debate on this issue. Now that devolution has been restored  to Northern Ireland,  a functioning Executive can and should tackle such problems head on. I urge the  Minister to act now to ensure that the  people of Dungiven and the surrounding area do not have to endure such  an unacceptable situation for much longer.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  Last Friday, I attended a meeting in Derry at  which two of my colleagues, Mr Brolly and Mr McClarty, were also present. The  first question that we were asked was from a community activist from the  Dungiven area about the bypass, and when it was happening. The community  activist highlighted the fact that the people of Dungiven have great concerns  about the pollution in the area, which is affecting people&rsquo;s health. I ask the  Minister how people can be expected to live with such a problem on a daily  basis, perhaps for another seven years, particularly as the pollution is well  above safety levels.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is not only people in Dungiven who would welcome a  bypass; the whole of the north-west awaits the day when that happens. As a  Member who drives through that town every day, I see the problems that people  face. They cannot open their windows. When I went into a shop one day, a lady  took time to tell me about her problems &mdash; she cannot keep the front of her shop  clean. The people of Dungiven cannot keep their homes clean. It is most unfair  that those people live in such a beautiful small town, yet they live with  pollution that is above safety levels. During Question Time on 25 February  2008, I asked the Minister to expedite progress on this matter. I was told that  he could not do that, but I ask him to, please, find some way of finding the  finances to give the people of Dungiven what they deserve &mdash; a bypass by their  town.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development (Mr Murphy)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann  Comhairle. I thank John Dallat for bringing the debate before the House. I  welcome the opportunity to discuss the issue  of traffic pollution and the situation in Dungiven in particular. I have  asked my officials to take note of the Hansard report so that if any points are  not picked up, we can write to Members after the debate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I can appreciate the frustration that Members have  expressed about the length of time and the added pressure of the pollution  factor. I appreciate that there is frustration in a great many places across  the North. I speak as someone who has experienced frustration over the years  while waiting for bypasses in my own part of the world. I fully accept that  there is an added issue in Dungiven.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This is not an issue of money, as some Members, including  John Dallat, suggested. I wish that more work had been done under the direct  rule and devolved Administrations before I took office, so that it would be at  a more advanced stage than it is now. When planning a major road scheme such as  a bypass, one must go through a series of processes. If those processes are not  followed, one might end up in court in a judicial review.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sufficient time must be spent on examining the route  options and narrowing down to a specific preferred option. Such a project would  affect hundreds of landowners from Derry right through to the Dungiven area. Those  people must be given the opportunity to comment on that and try to seek some  means of offsetting the impact that a major road project would have on their  land. If proper procurement procedures were not followed, the Department might  end up in front of the Public Accounts Committee &mdash; of which Mr Dallat is a  member &mdash; to answer for that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those processes take a frustratingly long time. As I said,  I appreciate that people have been frustrated by waiting for a bypass. I also  appreciate that there is an added fear factor because of the pollution in the  town.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Francie Brolly, George Robinson, Mary Bradley and others  have raised the issue with me, and I am conscious of the urgency around it.  However, demands for immediate action or fast-tracking are simply not possible,  as there are certain procedures that must be followed. If I had come into  office when all the statutory procedures had been followed and the route  options and procurement had been completed, I  could announce that work on the  bypass could begin. However,  I have come in at the beginning of a lengthy but necessary process, and  that is frustrating. Therefore, I share some of the frustration that people  feel.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I accept that traffic pollution is a real problem. No one  can underestimate the scale of the challenge for all of us as we deal with  pollution and with the related threat of climate change. Congestion has a  negative impact on our towns and cities, both environmentally and economically,  and those points were made during the debate. Congestion slows down business,  causes annoyance and frustration to drivers and pedestrians and affects the air  quality of those who live and work in towns and cities everywhere. Therefore,  we are investing in public transport and introducing measures to manage our  road network more effectively to improve traffic flows. However, even as we do  that, congestion is set to grow with increasing demands for travel. We face the  real threat of increased congestion in the future if we do not invest  sufficiently in effective measures now.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Turning to traffic pollution in Dungiven, a statutory  framework for improving air quality has been firmly established under the 2002  Environment Order, which provides a statutory framework within which air  quality is managed by district councils in the North. The framework requires district  councils to review and assess a range of air pollutants against the objectives  set out in the UK  air quality strategy, using a range of monitoring  and modelling observations and corresponding analysis. Councils are  required to declare locations where  objectives are not met as air quality management areas and to develop  action plans to ensure that the necessary improvements are delivered within an  appropriate timescale.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Relevant stakeholders, such as my Department&rsquo;s Roads  Service, have a responsibility to contribute to any action plan relating to  areas over which we have control or influence. I appreciate John Dallat&rsquo;s point  about councils not having complete responsibility for contributing to an action  plan, but other agencies with such a responsibility have an obligation to  contribute to those plans.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Nitrogen dioxide is predominantly a traffic-related  pollutant, with emissions generally highest in urban areas. Levels can vary  significantly throughout the day, with peaks generally occurring twice daily as  a consequence of rush-hour traffic. The contribution of road traffic to nitrogen dioxide has declined significantly in recent years due to the introduction of  tighter vehicle emission standards. Further reductions are expected to be achieved in the future as vehicle technology  improves.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Following a detailed review and assessment of air quality  in its area of responsibility, Limavady Borough Council has declared a section  of Dungiven Main Street  between the River Roe and numbers 89    to 106 Main Street an air quality management area for nitrogen  dioxide. As required under the legislation, an air quality action plan has been  prepared by the council and other relevant authorities. Roads Service has had  input into that action plan, which was submitted to the Department of the  Environment for appraisal during September 2007.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In developing the action plan, Limavady Borough Council  held consultations with Roads Service and various traffic management options  were considered, such as traffic calming, traffic signals, one-way systems and  traffic regulations. Initial considerations suggest that, for several reasons,  the location does not readily lend itself to developing traffic management  measures as potential solutions to air-quality issues. When the plan is finally  accepted, the Department of the Environment will monitor progress on the  achievement of actions identified in Limavady Borough Council&rsquo;s action plan to  ensure that the necessary air-quality improvements are achieved.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Roads Service places a high priority on upgrading the  north-west key transport corridor, which includes the proposed bypass. The  construction of a bypass around Dungiven would be expected to improve air  quality in the town, although local traffic would continue to use Main Street. On 3  July 2007, I announced the next stage of the process for procure&shy;ment of the A6  Derry to Dungiven dual carriageway. The study of alternative routes will be  carried out to examine the scheme options, which, in turn, will enable  selection of the preferred route.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Several options will be considered, and one preferred route  will be selected. That route will be announced in 2009. Development of the  scheme will include a comprehensive consultation process. A timescale for a  bypass is very much dependent on the progress of the overall A6 dualling scheme  from Dungiven to Derry. As with all major road  schemes, the timing of the construction will depend on the availability of  finance. Roads Service intends to take the complete scheme through all the  statutory processes as an entity, although Francie Brolly made the point that  this is a single scheme, and I accept that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members have suggested that the scheme be taken in stages,  with the Dungiven bypass advanced as an early part of that scheme, and I will  discuss that with the Roads Service. When I came to office, I inherited the  process as a single scheme that was to be taken forward as an entity before  commencing the procurement cycle, and that will, unfortunately, be  time-consuming.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A LeasCheann Comhairle, I have been in Dungiven and driven  through it many times. I appreciate the frustration of the community and of  those who travel from Derry to Belfast  and vice versa daily. I assure the House that this scheme will not be put on  the long finger. I will continue to try to examine ways of achieving the  project in the shortest possible time frame, not only for the sake of road  users and the journey time from Derry to Belfast, but, more importantly, for  the people who live on Main Street in Dungiven  and who have to put up with the unacceptable levels of pollution. It is  a priority for my Department to deal with that, and to do so in the shortest  possible time. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
