                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That the Second Stage of the Audit and
                Accountability Bill (NIA 6/02) be agreed.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last week, I introduced to the Assembly my
                draft Budget, which outlined how the Executive intend to spend
                almost £7 billion of taxpayers’ money. It is a fundamental
                principle of public life that the Executive are accountable to
                the Assembly and the people of Northern Ireland for the way in
                which that money is spent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Audit and Accountability Bill deals with
                the mechanics of public audit. It is a technical Bill, but it is
                important, as public audit is a key link in the chain of
                accountability that gives the public confidence that their money
                is properly spent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill relates to public audit structures
                and powers and has two main components. First, it reorganises
                the structure of public audit in Northern Ireland. Secondly, it
                is a central component in our implementation of the
                recommendations of Lord Sharman’s report, ‘Holding to
                Account: The Review of Audit and Accountability for Central
                Government’, following public consultation in Northern
                Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remind Members of the Bill’s context. The
                restructuring of public audit was originally included in the
                legislative programme for the previous session, as the audit
                reorganisation Bill. In that session, wider debate took place
                about public audit during the passage of the Government
                Resources and Accounts Act (Northern Ireland) 2001. The Sharman
                Report was also published at that time. Accordingly, my
                predecessor Mark Durkan undertook to withdraw the audit
                reorganisation Bill and to reintroduce it as the Audit and
                Accountability Bill, a vehicle to implement aspects of the
                reforms recommended in the Sharman Report. I shall outline the
                proposals in the Bill to restructure public audit.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Comptroller and Auditor General is
                responsible for most public audits in Northern Ireland. The main
                exceptions are local government and the Health Service. Health
                Service audits are carried out by the Department of Health,
                Social Services and Public Safety. In order to enhance the key
                principle of the independence of public audit, my Executive
                Colleagues and I intend that the Comptroller and Auditor General
                should assume responsibility for the statutory audit of Health
                Service bodies. The Department of Health staff who audit the
                Health Service will transfer to the employment of the Northern
                Ireland Audit Office.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Local government audits are different, as
                district councils are directly elected and local government is
                primarily funded by the rates, not by central Government.
                Independent auditing is still a fundamental requirement, but
                constitutional propriety means that local government should not
                be the responsibility of the Comptroller and Auditor General,
                who is an officer of the Assembly. It is, therefore, more
                appropriate that the responsibility for the audit function
                should remain with the Department of the Environment. However,
                for employment purposes, local government auditors should avail
                themselves of the enhanced career development and training
                prospects open to them as a result of their being part of a
                bigger organisation — the Northern Ireland Audit Office. We
                intend that those staff will be employed by the Northern Ireland
                Audit Office but will continue to be appointed to local
                government audits by the Department of the Environment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been a matter of concern, especially
                to the Public Accounts Committee, that, in the course of his
                audits, the Comptroller and Auditor General should be able to
                follow public money to ensure that it is being spent as intended
                and in a proper manner. That means that he must have proper
                access to documents. The Sharman review emphasised that the
                Comptroller and Auditor General should have the full range of
                powers necessary to do his job properly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In carrying out statutory audits and
                value-for-money studies, the Comptroller and Auditor General
                needs the power to obtain relevant documents. Those are normally
                available from the public body that he is investigating, but
                occasionally he will require access to third parties who may
                hold information that he needs. We could give the Comptroller
                and Auditor General that power if my Department were to make an
                Order. However, the principle of independence comes into play
                again. It is important that the Comptroller and Auditor General’s
                powers should not appear to be dependent on the very Executive
                that he is auditing, and that is why we have chosen to include
                access rights in the legislation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At present, the Comptroller and Auditor
                General often obtains information from third parties
                voluntarily. The Bill will mean that people and bodies that have
                a financial relationship with Government will be required to
                provide access to information relevant to that relationship. The
                Bill, therefore, goes further than both the Sharman review and
                the UK Government’s response to it. It requires not merely
                grant recipients and contractors, but also those benefiting from
                other kinds of financial assistance, including loans and
                guarantees, to provide relevant documents to the Comptroller and
                Auditor General. The Bill, therefore, ensures that he has the
                necessary powers to do his job.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill also ensures that those powers do
                not impose too great a burden on those who hold relevant
                documents. It takes account of the Human Rights Act 1998 and the
                European Convention on Human Rights. In particular, the
                Comptroller and Auditor General will be aware of the rights of
                third parties, under article 8(2) of the Convention, not to have
                the state interfere unreasonably in their private lives and
                correspondence. The Bill provides a legal framework to cover
                that and states that the Comptroller and Auditor General can use
                the power only where it is necessary and reasonable for him to
                do so. He will also draw up a more detailed code of practice to
                explain to those likely to be affected how he will use the
                powers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are some situations in which it simply
                would not be reasonable to expect people to provide information.
                The most important of those is where a person is in receipt of a
                social security benefit or a similar grant for their
                maintenance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is reasonable to expect someone who
                received a grant to insulate a house, for example, to be able to
                provide receipts and papers. That is what he got the money for.
                However, it is unreasonable to expect someone on benefits to be
                able to produce receipts for every item of groceries or clothing
                he buys, so people on benefits will be excluded from the
                legislation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bodies under the remit of the Comptroller and
                Auditor General at Westminster will also be excluded as a matter
                of technical jurisdictional courtesy. If the Comptroller and
                Auditor General requires information held by such bodies, he may
                obtain it on consultation with his Westminster counterpart.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill then deals with the extension of the
                number of bodies that will be subject to public audit. The
                Sharman review recommended that the Comptroller and Auditor
                General should be the auditor of all major non-departmental
                public bodies (NDPBs). That is a sound principle of public
                accountability, and the Executive intend that, where he is not
                already auditor of such a body, steps should be taken to appoint
                the Comptroller and Auditor General as its statutory auditor.
                The Bill is one necessary step to ensure that that happens.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, legislation is only necessary for
                some NDPBs. The Comptroller and Auditor General is already
                statutory auditor of many executive NDPBs. Other NDPBs are not
                founded in statute, so statutory amendment is not required to
                change their audit regimes. To fulfil the Executive’s policy,
                statutory amendment is only part of the picture. Accordingly,
                the Bill lists those major NDPBs that have a foundation in
                statute for which the Comptroller and Auditor General is not
                already the appointed auditor, and for which legislative action
                is necessary.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also important to recognise that some
                NDPBs are advisory in nature or are small and do not have enough
                funds to make it desirable that we apply the full rigours of a
                statutory audit regime. Others are limited companies, set up
                under companies legislation. European Directives govern those
                who can audit limited companies, and that does not include the
                Comptroller and Auditor General. Officials in the Department of
                Trade and Industry in London, in conjunction with the Department
                of Enterprise, Trade and Investment here, are considering the
                best way forward on that difficult issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill’s final measure again reinforces
                the important principle of independence. To ensure that the
                Executive cannot be seen to fetter the work of the Comptroller
                and Auditor General, the power to appoint the auditor and
                accounting officer of the Northern Ireland Audit Office is being
                transferred. My Department will no longer exercise that power;
                the Assembly’s Audit Committee will do so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill does not comprise the entirety of
                the Executive’s response to the Sharman review. It comprises
                the element about which it is possible and desirable to
                legislate. We are actively considering several of the other
                Sharman proposals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards the timetable for implementation,
                we intend the new proposals to apply to statutory audits and
                value-for-money studies taking place in the new financial year
                — after 1 April 2003. We also intend the transfer of audit
                staff to take place on that date.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill deals with technical and complex
                matters, but its aim is simple — to ensure that our
                Comptroller and Auditor General’s independence is not
                compromised and that he has all the powers that he needs to
                ensure that those who are responsible for handling public money
                are held fully accountable for the use of that money. By
                enhancing his powers, we enhance accountability both to the
                Assembly and to the citizens of Northern Ireland. The Bill
                reorganises audit structures to enhance independence, and it is
                central to our implementation of the Sharman recommendations.
                Accordingly, I commend the Bill to the Assembly.</p>

                I thank the Minister and his Department for the regular briefs
                and updates on the Bill that they have given to the Committee.
                The Committee has taken a keen interest in financial
                accountability, audit arrangements and the role of the
                Comptroller and Auditor General since the passage of the
                Government Resources and Accounts Act (Northern Ireland) 2001.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee successfully moved several
                amendments to the Government Resources and Accounts Bill and
                accepted an assurance from the then Minister of Finance and
                Personnel, Mr Mark Durkan, that its concerns, as well as those
                of the Public Accounts Committee, on the Comptroller and Auditor
                General’s right to follow public money would be addressed in
                the Audit and Accountability Bill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee welcomes the Bill and looks
                forward to the detailed examination of its provisions at
                Committee Stage. It especially welcomes the inclusion of all
                non-departmental public bodies within the remit of the
                Comptroller and Auditor General and the decision to grant him
                statutory access to documents held by third parties, including
                subcontractors, in receipt of public money.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In its response to the Department’s
                consultation document, the Committee accepted the arguments in
                favour of the reorganisation of the health and personal social
                services audit and the local government audit, and the greater
                powers given to the Comptroller and Auditor General in that
                respect.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee has not commented on the
                proposed transfer of powers to the Assembly’s Audit Committee
                and will be seeking the views of Committee members on that
                before compiling a report. The Committee will also be consulting
                the Assembly’s Public Accounts Committee on the Bill’s
                general provisions and on the role envisaged for the Public
                Accounts Committee, which is not made explicit in the Bill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee would be grateful for
                clarification on several issues, and the Minister may wish to
                respond today. Will the Bill provide the Comptroller and Auditor
                General with access to all organisations that receive public
                money? If not, what rules will govern access? For what purpose
                will access be provided, and what powers of inspection will the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee for Finance and Personnel will
                issue a public notice inviting views on the Bill. It will target
                organisations and individuals that provided input to the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for
                Finance and Personnel (Mr Beggs):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also welcome the introduction of the Bill,
                both as Deputy Chairperson and a member of the Assembly’s
                Public Accounts Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important when handling public money to
                ensure that it is well used, and that there is value for money
                and traceability. I welcome the fact that the Bill will widen
                the Comptroller and Auditor General’s remit to include the
                Health Service, local government and non-departmental public
                bodies. That should bring about significant improvements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the Public Accounts Committee has
                not gone into the detail of the accounts presented to it, the
                Comptroller and Auditor General has not been the main auditor
                and has not had the same control in directing the audits.
                Therefore I welcome the increased responsibility and
                independence given to him through the Bill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That will be particularly significant given
                the increased expenditure allocated to the Health Service. There
                is concern that money has not been well spent there: the
                Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety has had
                trouble, because of the complexities of the Health Service,
                tracing where money has been spent. I hope that, as a result of
                further input from the Comptroller and Auditor General,
                constructive suggestions come forward that may assist the
                Assembly in providing better services to all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a member of the Public Accounts Committee,
                I have experienced unfortunate occasions when non-departmental
                public bodies have handled public money poorly. The Bill will
                give the Comptroller and Auditor General an increased remit to
                ensure that proper standards are applied not only to Departments
                but to every non-departmental public body. That should have been
                happening. However, incidents that have been drawn to the Public
                Accounts Committee’s attention have made us aware that that
                has not been happening in the past. I hope that this development
                will increase the level of public scrutiny and increase the
                public’s confidence in how their money is being spent.</p>

                Dallat):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Chairperson of the Audit Committee and a
                member of the Public Accounts Committee I warmly welcome the
                Minister’s announcement of the new legislation. Increased
                powers for the Comptroller and Auditor General will enable that
                office to conduct audit trails that will send out a clear
                message, particularly to non-departmental Government bodies and,
                as Mr Beggs said, to the health boards and trusts, that the
                gravy train has at last run out of steam. The legislation has
                the potential to put the fat cats out of business once and for
                all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The new legislation has the full endorsement
                of the Audit Committee and the Public Accounts Committee.
                Members of those Committees recognise that it will elevate
                public accountability to a new level, where nearly every pound
                of public money can be scrutinised to see whether it was spent
                honestly, wisely and in the best interests of those who matter
                most — the people. Increased Audit Office powers mean that
                additional resources will have to be found to pay for the
                additional work. Nevertheless, I am certain that the return to
                the taxpayer will be at least tenfold.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the greatest tragedies of direct rule
                was the inability to ask questions about accountability. Even
                when the Assembly came into being and was allowed to get on with
                the business of scrutiny, the Public Accounts Committee had only
                a limited involvement. Many large bodies that guzzled huge
                amounts of public money were outside its remit.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The impression has been created that the
                health boards and trusts are bottomless pits that consume hugely
                increased budgets, only to provide a service that is getting
                worse. The Comptroller and Auditor General’s increased powers
                mean that Assembly Members, if we are allowed to, will be much
                better able to ask why we have increased waiting lists for
                operations, why the trolley waits have become a national
                scandal, and why bed blocking is now the most fashionable
                medical term in common use. I do not, I hasten to add, single
                out the Health Service. There are other equally important
                examples that I could use, as, no doubt, other Members will.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The new legislation will allow the Assembly
                to delve into the affairs of many other public bodies. I hope
                that those who in the past foolishly described members of the
                Public Accounts Committee as begrudgers, because they dared
                question how public money was spent, will draw their horns in. I
                hope that they will lend their full support to ensuring that
                never again will we have the scandals that have gone before, and
                that the services provided are the very best and serve the
                interest of nobody but the long-suffering public.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All that depends on our ability to defend the
                institutions of democracy. I hope that the weeping willows who
                are undermining the Assembly at present, and who do not show a
                great deal of interest in such mundane matters as increased
                powers for the Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee,
                will prove me wrong. Meanwhile, I thank the former Minister of
                Finance and Personnel, Mark Durkan, and the current Minister,
                Seán Farren, for their total co-operation with the Audit
                Committee in ensuring that the legislation has the broadest
                possible impact on how public money is accounted for.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Weir:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the previous Member laid down the
                challenge of avoiding begrudgery — a trap into which he
                himself occasionally falls — I shall try to look at the Bill
                constructively. We cautiously welcome the Audit and
                Accountability Bill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is welcome because of the need to increase
                the Comptroller and Auditor General’s powers. We live in an
                era in which money can be moved around more quickly than before
                — and with more hidden quality to it, we live in an electronic
                age in which powers so extensive are important to ensure that
                public money is spent correctly. Moreover, we live in an era in
                which the public, rightly, has a greater expectation that their
                money is well spent. As such, the principle behind the Bill that
                greater audit and accountability powers be given to the
                Comptroller and Auditor General is right.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also welcome the principles outlined in
                some aspects of the Bill. The fact that audit control seems to
                have been given to all non-departmental bodies is welcome. An
                increase in statutory access to documents that are held by third
                parties was highlighted in the Committee for Finance and
                Personnel by DUP members and others when discussing the
                Government Resources and Accounts Bill. Therefore I welcome
                those changes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee for Finance and Personnel, the
                Public Accounts Committee and the Audit Committee have also
                stated that the Comptroller and Auditor General should be given
                a proper degree of independence. The proposals contained in the
                Bill that afford that person the required level of independence
                to properly carry out his or her work are also welcomed. It
                makes sense that the Comptroller and Auditor General is the
                overseer of all Government activity. Therefore the movement of
                the health and local government functions into the hands of the
                Comptroller and Auditor General is logical.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I do strike a note of caution —
                and I mean no disrespect to the Minister or the proposals —
                because the Audit and Accountability Bill deals with complex
                financial arrangements. As such, it would be foolhardy for
                members of the Committee for Finance and Personnel to
                rubber-stamp what is before them now. The Committee will want to
                scrutinise the Bill to ensure that the key test is met, and, as
                the Minister rightly said, that test should be whether the
                Comptroller and Auditor General will be able to follow the
                money.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When discussing the Government Resources and
                Accounts Bill, the Finance Committee expressed reservations
                about the Department of Finance and Personnel’s apparent
                proposals. At that stage, the Committee looked at several
                proposed amendments. The Committee did not move those amendments
                in the end, because assurances were given that the concerns that
                they addressed would be dealt with in the Audit and
                Accountability Bill. It appears that those concerns have been
                met and that the Department of Finance and Personnel made moves
                to ensure that that was so. However, it is important that the
                Committee looks at the fine detail of the Bill to ensure that
                the assurances given during discussions on the Government
                Resources and Accounts Bill have been fulfilled. I hope that
                that is the case, because it is important to get it right now.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad that we have taken the best aspects
                of the Sharman Report and seem to be implementing them. However,
                there is an indication that the Bill rightly moves beyond the
                Sharman Report. In Northern Ireland — above all parts of the
                United Kingdom — there is a need for close scrutiny of audit
                and accountability. There has not been close enough scrutiny of
                audit and accountability for 30 years because of direct rule.
                However, the people of Northern Ireland are concerned that
                devolution has not made sufficient difference to their daily
                lives, and that their money is not being as well spent as it
                could be by this institution. It is important that Members
                satisfy people’s interest in this matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland’s public sector is larger
                than that of any other part of the United Kingdom, with regard
                to its expenditure and the vast range of bodies that can spend
                that money. Therefore, there is a particular need for scrutiny
                in Northern Ireland.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that the Bill give greater
                powers to the Comptroller and Auditor General to provide
                sufficient scrutiny to ensure that people get value for money.
                The key test for any Bill is how it impacts on people’s daily
                lives. If the Bill ensures that money is better spent and that
                it reaches people, rather than being wasted and spent corruptly,
                it will be a valuable contribution to society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We give the Bill a cautious welcome. However,
                we wish to ensure that the details match up to the principles
                that have been outlined. We hope that, when the Bill comes back
                for consideration, our questions and concerns will be properly
                addressed. Then we can move forward together with a Bill that
                satisfies the vast range of opinion in the Assembly Chamber, so
                that people are properly represented and their money is properly
                spent.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the general principles enshrined in
                the Bill. In short, it gives the Comptroller and Auditor General
                greater access to follow taxpayers’ money. One of the greatest
                responsibilities of an elected representative in a body such as
                the Assembly is to ensure that taxpayers’ money is properly
                spent, in a manner and for the purposes for which the House
                voted it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the past few years, it has come to the
                attention of the Public Accounts Committee that there has been a
                bad attitude towards the expenditure of taxpayers’ money. In
                the past, I have characterised that attitude as &quot;Well, it
                is coming off a broad back, and, therefore, it does not really
                matter.&quot; However, the challenge of every Member and the
                officials in Departments that have the onerous responsibility of
                accounting for taxpayers’ money comes in the following
                questions: if it were my money, would I spend it in that
                fashion? Would I adopt the same attitude, or would I be more
                cautious about how I spent it? If they can answer those
                questions in the affirmative, the chances are that the taxpayer
                will receive good value for money and that it will be spent for
                the purpose for which Members voted it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, that has not always been the case.
                Yesterday, we had a discussion wherein some Members suggested
                that it was not necessary to fill in little pieces of paper and
                that money should have been poured into an organisation because
                the cause underlying that body was good, and I accept that.
                However, we are responsible for every penny of taxpayers’
                money, and, therefore, we should abhor any shortcuts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reference was made yesterday to credit cards,
                which we will discuss later today. There is an attitude that
                must be changed. The sentiments and principles in the Bill will
                go some way towards changing attitudes, because it is all about
                the independence of auditing. It is all about transparency and
                accountability, and, if those factors are fed into the system,
                we can, and should, have a better system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I concur with Mr Weir. We are charged with
                the responsibility of scrutinising the Bill in the Committee for
                Finance and Personnel and of ensuring that, to the best of our
                ability, it properly fulfils the functions that we, as elected
                representatives speaking on behalf of the taxpayer, require and
                demand. I hope that the Bill will fulfil those functions, and,
                at a cursory glance, I believe that it will.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister of Finance and Personnel
                and his predecessor, Mark Durkan. I recall the Finance and
                Personnel Committee’s discussions of the Government Resources
                and Accounts Bill. I had profound doubt about whether the
                avoidance of producing a Bill that would implement the
                recommendations of the Sharman review had more to do with
                expediency than with a desire to move forward. The Department
                has honoured its commitments, for which I commend it. I look
                forward to the Committee’s forthcoming scrutiny of the Bill.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Finance and Personnel (Dr
                Farren): </b>I thank all the Members who commented usefully and
                positively on the general principles of the Audit and
                Accountability Bill. The Assembly is working together towards a
                common goal. I pay tribute to the Committee of Finance and
                Personnel’s efforts to ensure that we wor<b>k cl</b>osely
                towards the goal of ensuring that the Comptroller<b> and Auditor
                General will be as independent as possible and will have all the
                powers necessary to ensure that those responsible for handling
                public money are held fully accountable for its use.</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important to appreciate that the Bill
                does not stand alone. It is part of a web of accountability
                procedures, laws and structures that have been discussed in the
                debate and that bring us closer to the goal of ensuring proper
                accountability for the use of public funds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members expressed concern about the
                possibility that public money is not being spent properly. The
                Bill, on its own, does not provide a fail-safe guarantee that
                mismanagement, laxity and fraud will never again occur in the
                public sector in Northern Ireland. Those who seek to perpetrate
                fraud will continue to scheme and devise the means to do so, but
                we can try to develop mechanisms to prevent fraud, laxity and
                mismanagement as far as humanly possible, and, if they do
                happen, to detect them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although evidence of mismanagement, laxity
                and fraud emerges from time to time, we can be proud of the
                standards of accountability that existed in the public sector,
                notwithstanding the absence of the scrutiny by local politicians
                that is now possible under devolution.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My experience and the evidence demonstrate
                that there are high levels of probity and responsibility in all
                sectors of public service. We should be proud that our public
                service operates, by and large, to very high standards. That
                notwithstanding, it is the Assembly’s responsibility to ensure
                full accountability, which is as transparent as possible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall touch on some of the points raised by
                Members. Mr Molloy, speaking as Chairperson of the Committee for
                Finance and Personnel, asked for what purpose access is
                provided. The clear purpose is for statutory audit or
                value-for-money studies, particularly in the case of third
                parties. He also asked what powers of inspection are given. The
                powers are to request documents that are relevant to the audit
                or the value-for-money study in question from persons or bodies
                in certain relationships with the Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Molloy asked about the implications of the
                transfer to the Audit Committee. That will give the Assembly
                rather than the Executive the power to appoint the accounting
                officer. It will enhance the independence of public audit, and
                the Committee for Finance and Personnel will discuss that with
                the Audit Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Beggs touched on the audit of the Health
                Service. The Comptroller and Auditor General is already the
                statutory auditor of the Department of Health, Social Services
                and Public Safety. This Bill will make him auditor of health
                trusts and boards. At present he reports to the Assembly on the
                findings of the primary auditors of those bodies. The auditors
                are frequently from the private sector. This Bill makes the
                Comptroller and Auditor General the primary auditor of the whole
                health sector. I assure Mr Beggs that the public can continue to
                have full confidence in the statutory audits and value-for-money
                studies of the health sector in the same way as before the
                reform.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Molloy raised a point that I should have
                touched on regarding consultation with specific Committees, one
                being the Public Accounts Committee. My predecessor gave an
                undertaking during the passage of the Government Resources and
                Accounts Act (Northern Ireland) 2001 to consult on further steps
                to improve audit and accountability arrangements in Northern
                Ireland and revisit the subject of further legislation as we are
                doing. He said that we should carry out a consultation exercise
                in that regard on all the matters covered in this Bill and on
                the wider issues in the Sharman review of audit accountability
                from September 2001 until the end of November 2001.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We received 56 written responses, including
                those from Departments, local councils, voluntary and community
                organisations, professional bodies, audit bodies and
                individuals. The Public Accounts Committee held a public hearing
                on the Sharman review on 13 June 2002, and the Committee for
                Finance and Personnel has also taken a very keen interest in the
                subject. A summary of responses to the public consultation has
                been prepared and is due to be published very soon.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other Members said that they would be
                scrutinising the Bill in greater detail during the Committee
                Stage. I accept and acknowledge the compliments paid to my
                predecessor regarding his commitments, on which we are now
                attempting to deliver. That is why I feel that Members will see,
                in the final stages of this Bill, that the legislation will be
                effective and ensure that the objective of full and proper
                accountability will be achieved.</p>

                Bill (NIA 7/02) be agreed.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the chapter &quot;Working For A Healthier
                People&quot; in their first Programme for Government, the
                Executive made a commitment to put a framework in place to raise
                the quality of services provided to the community across health
                and personal social services. As the first step to fulfil that
                commitment, I presented my proposals entitled ‘Best Practice
                — Best Care’ for public consultation in April 2001. The
                responses to those proposals demonstrated widespread support for
                the introduction of new arrangements to underpin the quality of
                health and personal social services and to approve and extend
                the regulation of services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The results of the consultation were
                published on 11 June 2002. On the same date, I announced my
                decisions on the main elements of a new framework designed to
                promote the quality of health and care services delivered here.
                The main elements of the framework can be summarised as follows:
                a system for developing new, or implementing existing, standards
                and guidelines; regulation of services to be extended to cover a
                much wider range of services; minimum care standards to be
                developed for regulated services; a statutory duty of quality to
                be introduced in health and personal social services; a system
                of clinical and social care governance to be introduced; a
                single independent regulation and inspection body — the health
                and social services regulation and improvement authority — to
                be established, with the twin roles of regulating services and
                inspecting governance within health and personal social
                services; service development frameworks, similar to national
                service frameworks in England, Scotland and Wales, to be
                developed or adapted for use here; and a performance management
                framework to be developed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill will give effect to the elements of
                the overall quality framework that require legislative backing.
                The Bill’s various provisions need to be considered in the
                context of the overall quality framework. It provides for a
                statutory duty of quality to apply to all health and personal
                social services bodies that deliver services. It establishes a
                health and social services regulation and improvement authority,
                which will be responsible for monitoring the quality of services
                delivered by the health and personal social services by
                reviewing clinical and social care governance arrangements
                within those services. It provides for the new regulation and
                improvement authority to be responsible for the regulation and
                inspection of an extended range of services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Every year, hospitals here provide more than
                one million outpatient treatments. There are 500,000 admissions
                to hospitals or day procedure clinics every year. Every day,
                30,000 people see a doctor or practice nurse, and 120,000 people
                will visit a community pharmacy. An average of 180,000 people
                contact social services every year. More than 20,000 elderly
                people are supported in their homes. The vast majority of people
                receive the quality of services that they require. Regrettably,
                however, some service users do not.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The challenge that the health and personal
                social services face is to guarantee a quality of service that
                the public can expect to receive, regardless of where they go
                for treatment or care and regardless of which organisation
                provides it. The many medical, professional and technological
                advances, and increased public expectation of the standards of
                services delivered, make it vital that health and personal
                social services modernise and improve in the future, to enable
                those services to deliver a fast and effective high-quality
                service. Part of the emphasis on quality agenda is on ensuring
                that services and treatments are delivered safely and that steps
                are taken to reduce risk and to avoid problems.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At present, many health and social care
                services, including those to children and vulnerable adults, are
                not subject to independent regulation and inspection. Regulated
                services are often not delivered according to common agreed
                standards, and that leads to unacceptable variations in the
                standard of care and treatment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Publicity surrounding recent scandals in
                England, such as the Shipman case and the Bristol Royal
                Infirmary inquiry, combined with instances here, such as
                revelations about organ retention, and recent concerns about the
                storage of embryos and sperm samples, have shaken public
                confidence in our services. The introduction of a specific
                framework for clinical and social care governance will mark a
                major change for health and personal social services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Governance arrangements are, of course,
                already in place to ensure overall probity, transparency and
                adherence to public service values. Clinical and social care
                governance, backed by a statutory duty of quality, will mean
                that, for the first time, health and social services boards and
                trusts will have to place the provision of high-quality services
                to the forefront of their statutory duties in the same way as
                they must adhere to statutory financial probity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A framework for clinical social care
                governance will bring together all the existing activity
                relating to the delivery of high-quality services, including
                education and research, audit, risk management and complaints
                management. Many health and personal social services
                organisations have already begun to develop their own systems,
                based on systems elsewhere. The Bill’s intention is to ensure
                that a uniform set of principles will be applied to our unique
                organisational structures, and to take account of how services
                are delivered here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Health and personal social services
                organisations will be accountable for continuously monitoring
                and improving the quality of their services, and safeguarding
                high standards of care and treatment. Organisations will take
                corporate responsibility for performance and for provision of
                the highest possible standard of clinical and social care. The
                new arrangements will build on and strengthen existing activity
                relating to the delivery of high-quality care and treatment,
                including audit activity; identifying, promoting and sharing
                good practice; risk assessment and risk management; quality
                standards; complaints management; clinical and social care
                effectiveness; evidence-based practice; research and education;
                and effective leadership and management.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To ensure independent monitoring of clinical
                and social care governance, a single body, the health and
                personal social services regulation and improvement authority,
                will be created. Its core functions will be to regulate and
                inspect services, provide advice, conduct reviews of clinical
                and social care governance arrangements, carry out systematic
                service reviews and undertake investigations. The new authority’s
                powers will, therefore, be wide ranging.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition to its regulatory function, the
                authority will take the lead in conducting reviews of clinical
                and social care governance arrangements. Through a rolling
                programme of local reviews of health and personal social
                services organisations, it will independently scrutinise the
                clinical and social care governance arrangements developed to
                support, promote and deliver high-quality services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It will also help organisations to identify
                and tackle serious or persistent shortcomings in clinical or
                social care delivery, with the ultimate goal of supporting
                organisations in the delivery of high-quality, safe services.
                The authority will have a key role in providing users, the
                public, the Assembly and me, as Minister, with the assurance
                that systems are in place to ensure that the highest possible
                standards are adhered to and that the risk of something going
                wrong is greatly reduced.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many initiatives are ongoing to promote
                continuous professional development through lifelong learning
                and strengthening professional regulation. My proposals will
                bring together those initiatives so that they can be managed and
                monitored in one framework for improving the quality of
                services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Staff must also share ideas and good practice
                and take responsibility for the quality of services that they
                provide. Staff skills represent a significant investment that
                organisations must maintain by enabling employees to develop
                their skills and practice. A highly trained, competent and
                confident workforce is fundamental to securing the delivery of
                high-quality services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A summary of the Bill’s provisions is in
                the explanatory and financial memorandum. The Bill is in five
                parts. Part I deals with the establishment of the new authority
                and its general responsibility. Part II covers regulatory
                procedures. Part III deals with the statutory duty of quality
                and the new body’s responsibilities. Part IV lists the new
                body’s functions. Part V deals with the authority’s powers
                of inspection and review and the departmental power to introduce
                minimum standards.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to hear Members’ views, and will,
                therefore, conclude my remarks. The Bill represents a radical
                agenda for the Executive, the Assembly, my Department and health
                and personal social services. Service users will benefit from
                the extension of regulation to cover a wider range of services,
                including those delivered to the most vulnerable users — the
                elderly and children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much work is being done on those arrangements
                that do not require legislative backing, and much work will need
                to be done in the future. It will take time to achieve all that
                we plan to achieve. I will try to answer as many Members’
                points as I can at the end of the debate. If there is anything
                to which I am unable to respond today, I will write to the
                Member concerned. I commend the Bill to the Assembly.</p>

                </i><b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for Health,
                Social Services and Public Safety (Dr Hendron):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Bill. It follows through on
                proposals contained in the consultation document ‘Best
                Practice — Best Care’ to set clear standards for, and to
                improve the monitoring and regulation of, health and personal
                social services. I also welcome the Minister’s presence in the
                Chamber today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is an increasing and justifiable focus
                on how money is spent and on whether value-for-money services
                are being provided. That is a burning issue, especially for the
                Health Service, which has an annual budget of some £3 billion
                that accounts for some 40% of Northern Ireland’s block grant.
                The demographic trends in the preliminary census results that
                were published yesterday underline the increasing pressures that
                the Health Service will face in years to come. It underscores
                the need to test the effectiveness of the services provided by
                all Health Service bodies and to focus on areas in which
                performance can be improved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill’s aims are positive, but they must
                lead to the introduction of more economical and effective work
                practices, minimise bureaucracy and improve quality standards.
                It is imperative that the Minister take the necessary steps to
                demonstrate that limited resources are being deployed in the
                most effective and efficient way for the maximum benefit of the
                population. Patients who use the Health Service are entitled to
                expect quality care that is delivered consistently across board
                and trust boundaries.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad that the legislation has been
                introduced to the Assembly. It will establish a new, independent
                body that will assume overall responsibility for the regulation
                of services and for the inspection and monitoring of the
                clinical and social care governance arrangements in health and
                personal social services. We have been told that it will cost
                £5·6 million a year to operate the body, which is £2·8
                million more than at present. The Minister must demonstrate that
                that investment will provide a better regional service. She must
                convince the public that the new authority will not simply add
                another layer of bureaucracy, but that it will play a key role
                in ensuring that healthcare standards are being met and that the
                issue of clinical and social care governance is being addressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the establishment of clinical and
                social care governance. For many years, the teaching profession
                has been subject to inspections, and many of us can remember
                inspectors visiting schools. As someone who practised medicine
                in west Belfast for many years, I often wondered why teachers
                should have had to undergo inspections when doctors did not. I
                welcome the fact that all health professionals will be subject
                to clinical and social care governance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The recent inquiry into the use of human
                organs highlights the clear need for the establishment of a
                watchdog to check that corporate organisations have best-care
                systems in place and are adopting the right practices. The
                Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety
                understands that the new authority will produce an annual report
                for the Department and will publish the results of its
                inspections. As always, much of the detail will lie in the
                Regulations that are to follow, which the Committee will
                scrutinise.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister, as the authoriser of the new
                body’s work programme, must demonstrate clearly that her
                Department will hold the body to account. That is important. I
                am pleased that the Bill will give powers to the authority to
                assess the quality of some unregulated services that are
                provided by trusts, such as fostering and adoption. The
                Committee wants service provision in those areas to be improved
                to ease pressure on the children’s residential care sector. It
                is important that the statutory duty to deliver quality be
                applied equally to all services that are delivered by health and
                personal social services, whether they are provided by the
                statutory, voluntary or community sector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill does not set out a timetable for the
                regulation of services, which will undoubtedly depend on
                resources. The explanatory and financial memorandum indicates
                that the cost of running the new authority will lead to a net
                increase in expenditure of £2·8 million a year. Assumptions
                are made about the estimated income from the services to which
                regulation is extended. It is also pointed out that the level of
                fees has not been decided, and the minimum standards for the
                regulated services have not been developed. Extensive
                consultation on those matters is needed because they will
                directly impact on the minimum standards for healthcare
                providers such as nursing homes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee will focus its attention on the
                funding arrangements that the Department puts in place to
                support the Bill’s provisions. Those arrangements must ensure
                that the worthy aims of the legislation translate into genuine
                action to promote the quality of health and social care
                services, and that those aims do not founder because the
                necessary resources have not been committed. That is important.
                We do not want to be in a position in which, although proper
                minimum standards are set, staff cannot deliver them as a result
                of resource constraints. The Health Committee recently heard
                from Northern Ireland Public Service Alliance (NIPSA) officials
                of the deep frustration of social workers who cannot meet the
                quality standards set in respect of their statutory duties
                towards children. Although that is the case across Northern
                Ireland, it is especially so in the Foyle area, as we were
                recently informed by social workers. I trust that any resourcing
                gaps that are identified by the systems put in place to
                establish clear standards will be immediately addressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The introduction of a Bill that provides a
                framework to improve the quality of healthcare by establishing
                consistent minimum standards as well as establish a system of
                clinical and social care governance and improve monitoring and
                inspection, must be welcomed. My Committee Colleagues and I look
                forward to exploring the provisions of the Bill in detail at
                Committee Stage.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Ramsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
                In the previous debate, almost every Member touched on
                accountability and value for money in all Departments. I agree
                100% with that, but it must happen across the board. That is why
                I was surprised at the attitude of some Members today to
                yesterday’s debate on the Rape Crisis and Sexual Abuse Centre.
                With that in mind, I welcome the Bill and agree with the
                Minister that it introduces a radical agenda. It aims to develop
                overall standards in the Health Service and secures local
                accountability for the delivery of services. Moreover, it will
                improve the monitoring and regulation of those services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like the Minister and the Chairperson of the
                Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety, I
                welcome the proposal to establish a single health and social
                services regulation and improvements authority. Trusts and
                boards will have a statutory obligation towards equality, and,
                during the Bill’s Committee Stage, I intend to ask officials
                exactly how that will be introduced and whether there will be
                sanctions against the chief executives of trusts that fail to
                meet that obligation. The Bill’s impact will be beneficial for
                clients, service users and Health Service personnel. It should
                end the postcode lottery that can exist with quality care and
                that Members have referred to time and time again. The Bill will
                have a positive effect on protecting the rights of vulnerable
                people, whether in children’s homes or in homes for the
                elderly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also welcome the legislation and look
                forward to its Committee Stage.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCarthy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alliance supports the Bill to establish an
                authority to oversee the delivery of services by health and
                personal social services, as well as by our independent and
                voluntary private sectors. The Bill will go far towards
                achieving the goal of securing local accountability for the
                delivery of services and will improve their monitoring and
                regulation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill closes a variety of loopholes.
                Previously, some health and social services were exempt, for one
                reason or another, from proper regulation. For example, wholly
                private GP call-out services will be included in the regulatory
                framework as will private primary-care practices.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The House will not be surprised to hear of my
                particular interest in the section of the Bill that deals with
                personal care. I endorse the inclusion of residential care homes
                in the proposed regulatory scheme. I am pleased that the
                Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety
                considered the 1999 report of the Royal Commission on Long Term
                Care for the Elderly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Personal care is defined in the Bill as:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;(a) action taken to promote
                rehabilitation;</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b) assistance with physical or social needs;
                and</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c) counselling&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Such assistance can include help with
                bathing, toileting, dressing and eating for people who cannot
                perform those tasks for themselves. The Bill recognises the
                distinction between the services provided in residential care
                homes and in nursing homes, and that is incorporated in the
                Bill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Furthermore, I welcome the fact that
                domiciliary care agencies are to be included in the proposed
                regulatory schemes. Domiciliary care agencies provide vital
                services for people in their homes. Given the significance of
                personal care that is recognised in the Bill, and the services
                provided by nursing homes, why can the House not vote at an
                early date to provide personal care on the same terms as nursing
                care?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nevertheless, I welcome the Bill. That such a
                breadth of health and social services is being amalgamated in a
                singular, regulatory framework will help everyone involved to
                deliver the best possible care and practice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the Alliance Party and for me, the
                recognition of personal care only serves to underline its
                significance in our society. If the Bill is passed, I shall
                continue to campaign for free personal care in the new
                regulatory scheme. The Alliance Party fully supports the Bill.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Health, Social Services and
                Public Safety (Ms de Brún):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Members for their attention to the
                detail of the Bill and their warm welcome to its provisions.
                Several Members who spoke referred to the added value that will
                result from the establishment of the new authority, which will
                provide an independent check of the quality of the services
                delivered by the health and personal social services (HPSS) and
                the independent sector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The new authority will provide service users
                with greater safeguards on the services that they receive;
                reduce inequalities and improve equity by ensuring that services
                are delivered consistently across the North to meet the same
                minimum standards, regardless of where people live and whether
                services are delivered by the HPSS or the independent sector;
                and ensure that systems are in place to address poor
                performance. Therefore, it will also help to reduce the clinical
                negligence bill, which is an important factor for Members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The new authority will mean that, for the
                first time, the quality of services provided by HPSS will be
                independently monitored against agreed minimum quality
                standards. To ensure that effective clinical and social care
                governance arrangements are in place, the new authority will
                regulate more of the services delivered to children and
                vulnerable adults, including some that are provided by HPSS.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Providers will not be able to register those
                services that are to be regulated unless they meet minimum
                standards, and failure to register will mean that providers may
                not legally continue to provide those services. The new
                authority will also review the quality of, and access to,
                services across the North.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Between 1991 and 2001, £55 million was paid
                in compensation for clinical negligence. It is to be hoped that
                the work of the new authority will reduce that amount. Its work
                will also ensure that people have the assurance of minimum
                standards against which all services will be judged.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members referred to the Regulations.
                I agree that further work will arise, and I look forward to
                hearing the points that Colleagues raise during Committee Stage.
                It is to be hoped that I shall be able to provide further
                assurance then. Once the Bill’s principal Regulations have
                been drafted, we shall consult on them before they are laid
                before the House.</p>

                points that I have not covered. I shall ask officials to look at

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That this Assembly appoints Seán Neeson MLA
                as its nominee to the Regional Chamber of the Congress of
                Regional and Local Authorities of Europe.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Congress of Regional and Local
                Authorities of Europe is one of those bodies that rejoices in
                having an unpronounceable acronym. It was established in 1994 by
                the Council of Europe — not by the European Union. As a
                result, it represents 41 countries, which range from Portugal to
                the Russian Federation and from Cyprus to Iceland. It is
                significantly larger than the European Union, with which the
                Assembly deals more often.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two chambers represent regional and local
                authorities. There are 291 full members, 18 of whom come from
                the UK. Of those 18, one Member of the Scottish Parliament, one
                Member of the National Assembly for Wales, and one Member of our
                Assembly sit in the chamber of regions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The congress advises the Committee of
                Ministers and the parliamentary assembly at the Council of
                Europe, and provides a forum in which the experience of members
                of local and regional authorities across the continent is
                pooled. In doing so, it organises conferences and prepares
                reports on local democracy, especially that which is developing
                in central and eastern Europe. The congress also monitors the
                European Charter of Local Self-Government, to which the UK
                signed up in 1998. The Assembly has some catching up to do in
                terms of the powers and responsibilities of local government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have already said that one MLA sits as a
                full member in the chamber of regions. Cllr Jim Dillon of
                Lisburn City Council represents district councillors from
                Northern Ireland in the chamber of local authorities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have pleasure in proposing Mr Seán Neeson
                as the Assembly’s nominee to sit in the chamber of regions. He
                has had a keen interest in European matters, which dates at
                least from when he was elected to the previous Assembly in 1982.
                Before devolution, he regularly attended meetings of the EU
                Committee of the Regions as a representative of Northern
                Ireland. He has the ability to represent the range of opinions
                that are in the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful to David Trimble and Mark
                Durkan for supporting the concept that this nomination should go
                to a member of a party that is not in the Executive. I am unsure
                whether they acted in their capacities as the First Minister and
                the Deputy First Minister, or merely as party leaders, but I
                welcome the support of the Ulster Unionist Party and the SDLP.
                As well as taking party considerations into account, Mr Trimble
                and Mr Durkan also readily agreed to my suggestion that Mr
                Neeson would be an excellent choice personally.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I frequently criticise the Office of the
                First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, which is my
                function as an Opposition Member. However, it is appropriate
                that I should generously praise the Ulster Unionist Party and
                the SDLP for their support.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As for the amendment, it is for Members to
                choose how they view the two candidates. It is certainly not my
                position to criticise Edwin Poots. However, I was slightly
                surprised when I read the amendment, specifically because Mr
                Poots was described as</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept that that Committee has a remit to
                shadow OFMDFM in all aspects of its work, including European
                matters, but that remit overwhelmingly refers to European Union
                matters, not wider European issues.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It should not be assumed that the Chairperson
                of the Committee of the Centre should be automatically proposed
                as the Assembly’s nominee on a matter that concerns the
                Council of Europe, as opposed to the European Union.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots is a member of the same city council
                as Mr Dillon, who sits as a representative of local authorities,
                and whom I mentioned earlier. Although the relationship between
                Mr Poots and Mr&nbsp;Dillon appears to be fractious, they both
                belong to the Unionist family. To provide a more balanced
                representation for Northern Ireland, and taking into account Mr
                Neeson’s personal qualities, it is appropriate that he should
                represent the Assembly in the congress. I have pleasure in
                proposing Mr Neeson as the Assembly’s nominee.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I beg to move the following amendment: In

                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Edwin Poots MLA, Chairman of the
                Committee of the Centre,&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Edwin Poots had hoped to be in the Chamber
                for today’s debate, but he is chairing the subcommittee of the
                Committee of the Centre’s EU inquiry. He will endeavour to
                join us at some point during the debate. In chairing that
                subcommittee, Mr Poots has the confidence of the House. It is
                nonsense to say that neither the House nor the Committee of the
                Centre has any interest in a widening Europe, and I shall put
                that argument to rest. The European Union is widening and it is
                essential that Northern Ireland, as part of a member state of
                the European Union, play its role and contribute to that debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with Mr Ford’s analysis of the
                history of the Congress of Regional and Local Authorities of
                Europe. However, it would be wrong to accept that the Committee
                of the Centre has no interest in a widening Europe. It does have
                an interest in that important issue, and the Assembly must
                continue to play its role.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My party leader has received the largest
                share of the European election vote in Northern Ireland not
                once, not twice, but on five occasions. In 1999, 192,762 people
                put the DUP and its leader first in the European election,
                because they recognised that the DUP’s voice was essential to
                represent Northern Ireland authentically in Europe.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My party’s voice must also be heard in the
                appointment of the Assembly’s nominee to the regional chamber
                of the Congress of Regional and Local Authorities of Europe, and
                it would be wrong to set it aside in this matter. The DUP was
                kept off the Committee of the Regions, on which the Alliance
                Party had a member. The Northern Ireland representation on that
                committee was woeful and disappointing, and the voice of
                Northern Ireland was not properly heard. It is our hope that
                that situation will not be repeated in such an important body as
                this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Both the SDLP and the UUP already have
                representation in the regional chamber of the Congress of
                Regional and Local Authorities of Europe through council. Given
                the support that my party enjoys on European issues in the
                Province, it must be represented. It would be wrong to put a
                party into that body that would be boxing above its weight.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not want to participate in a slanging
                match or a history lesson about the Alliance Party’s stand on
                European issues. However, in the European election in 1999, the
                people of Northern Ireland gave the Alliance Party 2% of the
                vote, because its voice was not authentic on European issues and
                was unrepresentative. Mr Neeson was the candidate who received
                that 2% vote. We would be doing the House a disservice if we
                ignored what the people of this country said only a few years
                ago on that issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our nominee, Mr Edwin Poots, has been a local
                councillor for the past six years. He has distinguished himself
                as the Chairperson of the Committee of the Centre, an
                appointment that was supported by the House. He led the
                Committee in its most recent European report, which demonstrated
                an in-depth knowledge of European matters in the context of the
                European community and on the issue of a broadening Europe. It
                is essential that the person appointed has such experience and
                knowledge, and, as I said, he has led that Committee on European
                matters. That report received the endorsement of the House, and
                it follows that the person best placed to take on this role is
                the Chairperson of the Committee of the Centre, which has a
                brief to consider European issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Edwin Poots is young, and it would send out
                the right message to appoint a young person, irrespective of
                party background, to represent a young and dynamic Ulster. It
                would be wrong to overlook that important point, because
                Northern Ireland has one of the youngest populations in Europe.
                Too many people would dismiss that, but it is one of our strong
                points.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It gives me pleasure to support the
                amendment. I hope that Members will consider the political and
                non-political arguments and will appoint the candidate who is
                capable, has the required knowledge and expertise, and has had
                the Assembly’s support when dealing with European issues. If
                that happens, this body will be able to genuinely represent
                people’s wishes and concerns.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I spoke to the SDLP and Ulster Unionist Party
                Whips, and it was made clear that neither of the nominees had
                the official support of those parties. It seems that something
                was said to Mr Ford to indicate that Mr Neeson would be regarded
                as the unofficial nominee of the First Minister and the Deputy
                First Minister. That is what was imparted this morning. The
                Whips said that the parties would not be voting on this, but
                they should vote, and they should vote for our amendment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members should not be left with the
                impression that Mr Neeson is the official nominee of the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister. If he is, Members may
                wish to consider whether they want to support someone who may be
                in the pockets of the First and Deputy First Ministers because
                of that. That would not send out the right signal. Mr Poots,
                however, has the support of the Assembly because he has been
                Chairperson of the Committee with responsibility for European
                issues.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When I was listening to David Ford’s
                eulogy, in which he spoke of the UUP’s and SDLP’s support
                for his nominee, I was minded to warn him of the exhibition that
                he made of himself when he became the back end of a horse for a
                day and produced the sort of political material that, in equine
                terms, the back end of a horse might produce. He was then
                totally shafted, because, having received some sort of a promise
                of a review, he got absolutely nothing. He displayed a degree of
                political judgement that would make one wonder.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">David Ford’s candidate was formerly the
                leader of the Alliance Party, and, curiously enough, was
                succeeded by Mr Ford, who is now attempting to hand out some
                sort of consolation prize. Mr Neeson, who we are about to
                suggest should represent us, displayed even more monumental
                political misjudgement than his new leader when he decided that
                the Alliance Party would withdraw its candidates from contesting
                certain constituencies, including North Down. I make no
                apologies, not so much for pointing out what happened to Bob
                McCartney, but for pointing out the dire consequences of that
                decision for Mr Neeson, whose position was rapidly usurped by
                his current benefactor.</p>

                However, what support has he received from his own party? It
                failed to put him forward as a parliamentary candidate, despite
                his being party leader, and subsequently it gave him the bullet
                when it came to his continued occupancy of the august position
                of leader of a party that —</p>

                than I would employ.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us look at who the Assembly is intending
                to send forth as its representative — a person who has not
                distinguished himself in his own party, who has been dismissed
                or discharged as being suitable for the party leadership, and
                who has not enjoyed the support of the rank and file of the
                people who voted in the European election. He is now being
                offered some sort of consolation prize as the party
                representative. If the Assembly wants to send forth as its
                plenipotentiary in these matters such an exhibit of political
                success, so be it. However, before it does so, Members should
                take stock of just what this candidate has offered in the past
                and what he now has to offer in what may be the autumn of his
                political career.</p>

                an anti-European to Europe to represent our interests? The DUP

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I suspect that all the useful things that
                need to be said have already been said. However, some of Mr Ford’s
                remarks require comment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is ironic that the Alliance Party has made
                a nomination, bearing in mind some of the comments of my
                Colleague Ian Paisley Jnr. It must be remembered that when Mr
                Neeson — who, by definition, is a decent individual —
                submitted himself to the electorate, he was able to achieve only
                around 2% of the popular vote. I am sure that he has reflected
                on that, and I am surprised that he has let his name go forward
                in the light of his performance in the European election.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For 20 years or more, my party has
                consistently topped the poll in European elections. Would it not
                be right and proper for that to be reflected in the Assembly’s
                nomination?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford inferred it. He said that Mr Jim
                Dillon from Lisburn City Council was one of the nominees, and
                that there would be another nominee from that council. Mr Poots
                would not be nominated as a member of Lisburn City Council; he
                would be going forward as the nominee of the Assembly. Mr Ford
                found it — <i>[Interruption]</i>.</p>

                anti-European? Or, perhaps I am wrong in that it is not from an
                anti-European stance that the DUP is making its nomination.</p>

                party has taken a stance on Europe, and we should not try to
                walk past what the people say. Ms Morrice may want to do that in
                the Women’s Coalition, and that may be why it secured such a
                mammoth vote. However, what Ms Morrice is trying to say goes
                past me; I do not accept her point. It would be a total irony if

                leadership it decreased even more — and that was because of
                him. It is imperative that Mr Poots be the nominee. After all,
                Mr Ford became a Unionist when it was politically expedient to
                do so, and I am sure that Mr Neeson will be pro- or anti-Europe
                whenever it is politically expedient to be so.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member should be aware that the DUP’s
                nominee at that time was an alternate member who was never
                entitled to go to any of those meetings. When the person from
                the Benches over there who was supposed to attend meetings did
                not go, he did not inform the DUP’s nominee of his right to
                go, so he was not entitled to do so. That should never be
                allowed to happen again.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept that I failed to use the word
                &quot;alternates&quot;, and I apologise for that. It was
                certainly my understanding at that time that, rather than Mr
                Paisley’s pointing the finger in this direction, the DUP
                member was an alternate to an Ulster Unionist, and the Alliance
                member was an alternate to an SDLP member. Mr Neeson, as the
                Alliance alternate, attended at least as many meetings as either
                of the full members. I cannot understand why other members did
                not speak to their alternates on those occasions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The debate started off with some moderately
                sensible comments but degenerated into petty sniping from the
                Benches on my left. I applaud Seán Neeson’s courage in
                stating the case for Europe, and, when he has had the
                opportunity, in playing a practical part at European level,
                principally in European Union institutions. He has shown that he
                can stand up for what is right for Northern Ireland, and he
                deserves the confidence of the Assembly to represent us.</p>

                credit cards used in the payment of expenses by personnel in
                Government agencies, as contained in the reports by the
                Comptroller and Auditor General, and calls for a comprehensive
                review of how Government Departments and their agencies settle
                their accounts.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I tabled this motion because, as Chairperson
                of the Audit Committee and a member of the Public Accounts
                Committee, I am concerned that the practice of issuing credit
                cards in the public sector is becoming a threat to the normal
                financial controls that must operate when taxpayers’ money is
                being spent. The threat to financial controls leading to misuse
                and abuse of credit cards is at two levels. First, there is
                evidence, which I shall deal with later, that credit cards are
                being used to subvert accountability to the Assembly for the
                spending of public money. That is happening because credit cards
                can be used to circumvent the provision of financial details in
                invoices and receipts, which are normally used to verify the
                integrity of transactions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, it is also clear that the credit
                cards are particularly open to abuse in the area of travel and
                hospitality expenses, which are notoriously difficult to
                control, even in the best of systems. When there is extensive
                use of credit cards, there is a correspondingly significant
                increase in the risk of impropriety. It is important for the
                Assembly to highlight that problem at as early a stage as
                possible and to challenge Departments to provide us with
                assurances that they will tackle it vigorously before more harm
                is done to the public’s perception of financial integrity in
                the public sector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To gain some idea of the usage of such cards,
                I have submitted written questions to all Departments and the
                Assembly to seek details of the number of cards issued and the
                expenditure incurred on them during 2001-02. Some very
                interesting statistics emerged from my enquiries, many of which
                raised more questions than answers. For example, throughout the
                public sector, 201 credit cards have been issued, with
                expenditure of more than £1·5 million having been incurred on
                them. In other words, approximately £7,500 was spent on each
                card. The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development has
                incurred the most on its cards — almost one third of the total
                credit card expenditure. In contrast, some of the larger
                Departments have no expenditure and have not even issued any
                credit cards.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One surprising finding of the exercise was
                that the Assembly had issued more cards than any other body. In
                2001-02, it had 45 cards in use, which was more than all the
                main Departments put together. It has also spent vastly more on
                credit cards than any other Department, excluding the Department
                of Agriculture and Rural Development — some £230,000. I
                highlight that because, as everyone in the House will agree, we
                must be absolutely sure that, when we exercise our scrutiny role
                over the Civil Service Departments, our own practices and
                procedures must be beyond reproach and fully transparent. I
                recognise that, if properly controlled, there are benefits from
                the use of credit cards. That is worth repeating. Credit cards
                can have benefits, if they are properly controlled.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government Purchasing Agency operates a
                card system for Departments that is intended to reduce the cost
                of purchasing transactions. That is eminently sensible, as the
                scheme is firmly underpinned with careful guidance on how and
                when the cards can be used, and I fully support that. It is not
                my intention to try to turn the clock back and stop the use of
                credit cards; my concern is that they must be properly
                controlled. Credit cards are open to abuse, therefore the
                operation of those controls must be subject to careful
                safeguards and checks. At present, the problem does not receive
                sufficient priority from some Departments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us review the evidence to date. The first
                time the abuse of credit cards came to my attention was during
                the Public Accounts Committee’s review of the Fire Authority.
                During the evidence session, the Committee heard that a Fire
                Authority official had used the departmental credit card to
                cover travel costs incurred by a member of his family — he
                used the card for personal purposes. To compound the error, the
                official subsequently forgot to pay the amount due, until it was
                drawn to his attention. That incident drew my attention to the
                potential pitfalls of using credit cards.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The next time that I came across misuse of
                credit cards was during the Public Accounts Committee’s review
                of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board. Once more, there was
                evidence that an official in New York was using a card for
                personal purposes. However, I shall not bore Members with the
                details, as the Committee will report on the matter later in the
                session.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The latest case of credit card misuse is in
                the &quot;Into the West&quot; project. The Department of
                Enterprise, Trade and Investment is carrying out a review of the
                matter and will produce a report soon. However, such are the
                alleged abuses in the scheme that they have already reached the
                newspaper columns. I shall not comment any further on those
                cases because the allegations have yet to be formally reported.
                The Public Accounts Committee will undoubtedly consider any such
                report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, common themes emerge from each of
                the cases to which I have referred: the use of credit cards for
                personal purchases; poor controls in the monitoring of credit
                card expenditure; and poor backing papers in support of
                payments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the strengths of the Northern Ireland
                system is that the average man in the street has confidence in
                the integrity of public administration — I cannot emphasise
                that enough. That confidence must not be taken for granted. It
                is a fragile plant that could wither in the face of repeated
                failures of financial control and impropriety. Therefore I call
                on the Minister of Finance and Personnel to give the problem the
                highest priority before it does more extensive damage to the
                credibility of our beloved institutions. I would not be
                surprised to be told by the Minister that a great deal of work
                is already under way.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome today’s debate. It is interesting
                that we are back to debating financial probity and
                accountability as, earlier today, the Audit and Accountability
                Bill was given its Second Stage. It appears that Members are
                back on track with such matters, as measures to ensure that
                financial probity, accountability and transparency were
                described as technical distractions yesterday, when we wanted
                money thrown at projects without any such safeguards.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support Mr Dallat’s motion, and I echo
                his sentiments that credit cards when used in the right
                circumstances can be beneficial. The Public Accounts Committee
                has already raised the issue, and its concerns are well
                documented.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the Public Accounts Committee’s
                evidence session with the Northern Ireland Tourist Board on 30
                May, the Chairperson stated:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Public bodies issue credit cards
                without proper control or guidance, and the cards have become a
                mechanism for bypassing the normal careful treatment of
                hospitality and expenses. They are given to staff who, for the
                most part, are not trained to use them; some officials, when
                they get their hands on a piece of plastic for which they are
                not personally paying the bills, seem to lose all sense of value
                for money and, in some cases, all sense of propriety.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although I was not a member of the Committee
                at that time, I share those concerns. However, the problem is
                not unique to us. The trend towards increased use of credit
                cards is happening everywhere. There have been cases in Britain,
                which have been dealt with by the Public Accounts Committee at
                Westminster, in which credit card misuse has featured.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is interesting about those cases, and
                cases that have been dealt with locally, is that credit card
                misuse is almost always associated with other major problems of
                impropriety — lack of financial control or poor standards of
                administration. It is generally a symptom of more serious
                administrative malaise, which is why it is always important that
                it be fully investigated and vigorously tackled.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Public Accounts Committee has asked the
                Comptroller and Auditor General to be especially vigilant in
                examining credit card expenditure in his audits of all public
                bodies in the North. I am glad to report that he has undertaken
                to do that, which is reassuring. However, it is not enough, as
                audit — by its very nature — is retrospective. That is why
                the real burden of dealing with the issue falls on those who
                have responsibility for financial control in the day-to-day
                operations of Departments and their subsidiary bodies. That
                applies especially to the Department of Finance and Personnel,
                which, I am sure, shares the Public Accounts Committee’s
                concerns.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the course of its work, the Public
                Accounts Committee requested the Department of Finance and
                Personnel to issue further guidance on the control of credit
                cards. I would like to hear an announcement from the Minister
                that adequately addresses the Committee’s concerns.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I apologise to the Member for calling him as
                Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel,
                when it is the Public Accounts Committee of which he has
                recently become Deputy Chairperson.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like Mr Murphy, I commend Mr Dallat for
                tabling the motion. It comes at a particularly opportune time,
                as reports are being prepared that highlight what can only be
                referred to as &quot;dubious practices&quot;. As elected
                representatives, Members have a duty to taxpayers. At Budget
                time, Members vote to allocate taxpayers’ money to various
                Departments, to be spent on legitimate purposes agreed by the
                Assembly. It is, therefore, incumbent on Members to ensure that
                taxpayers’ money is properly accounted for in all cases.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Earlier today, the Assembly agreed the Second
                Stage of the Audit and Accountability Bill, which will help to
                open up more accounts to the scrutiny of the Comptroller and
                Auditor General, enable him to better follow taxpayers’ money,
                and demonstrate transparency and accountability. This debate
                highlights the potential abuse of credit cards. Today,
                therefore, the Assembly is sending out a strong message that
                abuse of taxpayers’ money will not be tolerated. Indeed, zero
                tolerance will be the benchmark.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Credit cards are, undoubtedly, a convenient
                and less painful way of spending money — even one’s own
                money. However, a piece of plastic can make some people feel
                like millionaires. They can be tempted to dispense largesse as
                if there is no tomorrow, with the foolish belief that the end of
                the month is merely a mirage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As guardians of the public purse, the
                Assembly must make certain that meaningful controls are in place
                to ensure, as far as possible, that abuse or careless
                expenditure cannot take place. It is equally important, should
                careless or inappropriate expenditure take place, to take strong
                action against any transgression. Those who have credit cards
                issued to them by Departments, or by the Assembly, need to
                remember that it is not their money. They should therefore think
                at least twice before using such a card. They must be in no
                doubt that they will be held accountable for its use and,
                certainly, for any abuse.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regrettably, my experience on the Public
                Accounts Committee has shown me that, at times, a distinct lack
                of control seems to exist in the minds not only of those who
                have use of a card, but, more alarmingly, in the minds of those
                who have a financial control function. At times, they appear to
                have been remiss in exercising control and authority. A crazy
                situation arose in the Public Accounts Committee where attempts
                were made to convince the Committee that expenditure on a
                certain credit card was totally justified even though thousands
                of pounds worth of receipts were missing.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A credit card can fuel a bad attitude towards
                taxpayers’ money, and we need to change that. We must put the
                brakes on and rein in the big spenders by ensuring that proper
                controls are in place. A duty of care exists not only on those
                who have a credit card, but on those who issue them. They too
                are accountable, and they must realise that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Credit cards can be and, at times, are a
                temptation. Those entrusted with them should learn the lesson
                from the Lord’s Prayer:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Lead us not into temptation&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They should be assured that they will never
                be delivered from having to account for their expenditure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I regret that the Minister of Enterprise,
                Trade and Investment is not in the Chamber. Yesterday, I asked a
                pretty innocuous question about credit card use for hospitality
                in New York. I want to make it abundantly clear to all Members
                that the reason so many questions have been asked of the
                Northern Ireland Tourist Board (NITB) is, unequivocally, the
                reluctance of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment
                to answer fully questions posed by the Public Accounts
                Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a lesson therein. When an accounting
                officer appears before the Public Accounts Committee, he has a
                duty to answer questions clearly and unequivocally, and to get
                directly to the point. There must be no attempt to avoid the
                issue, because that leads to many questions. That is why many
                questions have been asked about credit cards, and of the NITB in
                particular.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McClarty raised the cost of such
                questions. The cost of those questions pales into total and
                absolute insignificance when compared to the damage the public’s
                confidence suffers when they realise that Departments have
                failed to exercise control over how taxpayers’ money is spent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us examine some of the Public Accounts
                Committee’s reports. The ‘Report on Internal Fraud in the
                Local Enterprise Development Unit’ uncovered £200,000 of
                fraud. The ‘Report on the Brucellosis Outbreak’ at the
                Agricultural Research Institute found that more than £1 million
                had been wasted. A report on the community regeneration schemes
                has found some £8 million of loans. In the ‘Report on The
                Rural Development Programme’, the sum of money was some £50
                million. The common thread that runs through those situations
                was a lack of control. The motion is about trying to impress
                &quot;control&quot; as the watchword and about emphasising that
                there is no moving away from the need to follow clear guidance
                and controls.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s comment yesterday
                that credit cards</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;are a perfectly legitimate means of
                dealing with public expenditure provided the procedures are in
                place to ensure accountability.&quot; <i>[Official Report, Bound

                </i></font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The core issue, as the Minister said, is to
                ensure that the people who use credit cards are accountable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given that the Tourist Board did not even
                know that its New York manager was using the card and that the
                Minister’s Department did not know whether instructions to
                stop using it had been issued or whether there had merely been
                discussion on the matter, I fail to understand how Sir Reg Empey
                can be satisfied that proper procedures were in place and that
                the manager was accountable. Control, control, control will lead
                to accountability. As elected representatives, we should settle
                for nothing less. I know and trust that the Minister will treat
                the issue with the importance that it deserves, and will
                introduce the necessary controls on the use of credit cards and
                the spending of public money.</p>

                seemed to pre-empt the Public Accounts Committee’s report.
                That report will eventually make its way to the House where it

                The Public Accounts Committee has already dealt with the issues
                to which I referred. The reports are in the public domain, and
                if the Member doubts that, I shall gladly provide him with

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Kennedy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At least Mr Dallat showed some caution when
                discussing the matter in the absence of the appropriate
                Minister. It might have been more reasonable for Mr Close to
                have waited until the Minister at whose Department his
                criticisms were aimed had the opportunity to respond in the
                Chamber. However, I understand that Dr Farren is the Minister
                who takes the lead on those issues, and he is in the Chamber
                today. I look forward to his response.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On behalf of the Ulster Unionist Party, I
                stress that the abuse of credit cards is inexcusable and
                indefensible. It cannot be justified in any circumstance, and
                any impropriety must be investigated and dealt with
                appropriately. We should allow the systems and procedures that
                have been put in place by the House, and by Ministers who are
                accountable to the House, to be followed before we establish
                ourselves as judge, jury and, perhaps, executioner. To ensure
                accountability, staff who are responsible for carrying a credit
                card should be given appropriate training and should take care
                to provide receipts for transactions whenever possible. I hope
                that the Minister will include such measures in any proposed new
                scheme or approach.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When commenting on this, people have a
                tendency to make allegations without producing evidence to back
                them up. There has been much public comment on the matter, and
                it cheapens the debate when Members resort to making such
                allegations in public. Members should not use the issue to
                promote themselves or to start a political vendetta.
                Unfortunately, the evidence suggests that some Members are
                intent on doing just that. I hope that such behaviour will be
                avoided in future. I look forward to the Minister’s response.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. Mr
                Kennedy referred to political vendettas and possible motives.
                Has he ever declared an interest when Northern Ireland Tourist
                Board issues have been discussed and allegations made in the
                Assembly? He has frequently attacked some Members and defended
                others who have questioned those matters; however, I have yet to
                hear him declare an interest, in that he was a member of the
                Northern Ireland Tourist Board.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Madam Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member knows, as a former Chairperson of
                the Committee on Procedures, that Members’ interests are
                declared in advance in the Register of Members’ Interests. I
                am assuming that Mr Kennedy has done that.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Kennedy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. It
                is important that I establish the fact that, as far as I know, I
                have registered that interest with the appropriate body.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Carrick:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my circumstances, I can honestly claim not
                to be publicly or politically profiling myself for any
                forthcoming elections. Anything I say, therefore, is in the
                interests of the voter, the general public and — as Mr Close
                indicated — accountability. That is how it should be when it
                comes to the use or misuse of public funds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In some ways, it should not have been
                necessary to table the motion. The vast majority of Government
                officials and agency staff observe the highest standards of
                financial propriety and are fully compliant with the guidelines
                for the use of credit cards. However, the issue has come to the
                attention of the Public Accounts Committee, and I want to
                emphasise to Mr Kennedy that there is ample evidence of credit
                card misuse in the public sector. It is clear from the
                Comptroller and Auditor General’s reports that the public
                sector’s use of credit cards is a growing problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other Members referred to specific cases that
                have come to the Public Accounts Committee’s attention. Those
                cases reveal two weaknesses about the way in which some public
                bodies have handled the growing number of credit cards in use.
                First, cards appear to be issued without proper guidance for
                staff on their use. That is surprising. In those circumstances,
                it is little wonder that some staff have abused cards and
                attempted to circumvent the public sector’s normally strong
                controls for ensuring that payments and refunds of expenses are
                incurred properly and accounted for fully. That is strange. The
                evidence suggests, however, that in some cases there was a lack
                of knowledge about policy. It might be thought unnecessary to
                spell out to public servants that office credit cards should not
                be used for cash withdrawals or for personal expenses. However,
                as Mr Dallat said, experience shows that that does happen.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moreover, credit cards are often issued to
                senior management, and it is especially regrettable that people
                in management positions were responsible for several of the
                recent lapses — not the tea maker or the canteen lady. They
                have no excuse for their actions. Their personal standards
                should have told them that they should not misuse or abuse
                public funds. Senior management should set an example in how to
                account for expenditure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned about a second issue.
                Departments must realise that it is not good enough merely to
                issue guidance on the use of cards. It seems that, although
                comprehensive guidance was issued, procedures were not in place
                to ensure that staff were familiar with it and that they
                followed it. To monitor guidance and policy is insufficient.
                Action would have ensured that problems were identified earlier.
                Indeed, it might have prevented problems from escalating to a
                point at which they were so worrying as to threaten to discredit
                the use of credit cards altogether.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not want it to become necessary to ban
                or severely restrict the use of credit cards in the public
                sector. There is a good case for using credit cards for some
                transactions, so long as the normal trail of accountability for
                public money is not undermined. That must be emphasised.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sustaining accountability is a challenge for
                Departments, and, by drawing attention to the problem today, it
                is to be hoped that Members will ensure that the Minister acts
                promptly to put the use of credit cards in the public sector on
                a sound footing and so prevent the escalation of the worrying
                problems that we have seen in the past two years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It should not have been necessary to have
                this debate. However, the Public Accounts Committee has
                accumulated sufficient evidence on credit card abuse to support
                its call for a comprehensive review of how Departments and their
                agencies settle their accounts.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Finance and Personnel (Dr
                Farren): </b>On behalf of the Executive, I welcome the
                opportunity to respond to the motion. I listened carefully to
                the Members who spoke. In the past few months, I have noted the
                concerns of the Northern Ireland Audit Office (NIAO) and the
                Public Accounts Committee about the use of credit cards by
                public bodies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I emphasise that propriety and proper
                standards in public life are vital for those who are involved in
                the work of Government. The Audit and Accountability Bill, which
                Members discussed this morning, demonstrates clearly the
                Executive’s intent to strengthen mechanisms for effective and
                stringent forms of accountability. The general welcome that the
                Bill received confirms that that intent is widely shared in the
                House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The integrity of the processes of the
                institutions in Northern Ireland must be supported by the proper
                control by officials of the handling of public money, and that
                applies equally to the use of credit cards.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members acknowledged that there are
                certain significant benefits in using credit cards for some
                types of transaction. Their use can be more cost-effective and
                efficient than other methods of payment, and it is important to
                remind Members of that. Therefore, in principle, I have no
                objection to their use, and I am not necessarily concerned about
                the number in circulation. However, the controls that are
                associated with their use are key, whatever their number.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are potential problems with credit
                cards if they are used inappropriately or if there are
                inadequate internal controls. I agree with Mr Dallat’s
                comments about the need to properly control the use of the
                credit cards. It is important to have rigorous safeguards,
                because the nature of credit cards means that those controls
                must be watertight. The Department of Finance and Personnel has
                issued guidance that makes that abundantly clear.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dallat referred to the procurement card
                scheme that my Department’s Procurement Service operates; I
                encourage its use. The Government procurement card provides all
                the benefits and facilities of the more traditional corporate
                credit card, but, importantly, it can provide more security and
                more controls. Those include enhanced indemnities and
                restrictions on the monthly accounts and categories of spend. It
                is for those reasons that the use of the Government procurement
                card is recommended for all public bodies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dallat mentioned the case of credit card
                misuse in the Fire Authority for Northern Ireland. In that case,
                the Chief Fire Officer incurred personal expenses. That was
                wrong, which he has acknowledged. Subsequent to the publication
                of the Public Accounts Committee’s report, my Department wrote
                to all Departments and advised them that personal expenses must
                not be charged to credit cards.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">More recently, concerns about the use of a
                credit card by the Northern Ireland Tourist Board’s New York
                office manager were highlighted in a Public Accounts Committee
                evidence session. The report on that case will be published
                shortly, and I await it with interest. I trust that it will be a
                further spur to addressing issues that are in the public domain,
                and my Department will follow up on relevant matters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the Tourist Board evidence session, my
                Department gave a commitment that it would revisit the guidance
                on the use of credit cards to ascertain whether it could be
                further strengthened and developed. My Department has now
                prepared revised guidelines on the use of credit cards, and
                those will be issued shortly to all Departments and public
                bodies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Training courses already exist in matters
                regarding financial recording and control, and those will also
                be reviewed to ensure that they meet the needs of proper
                accountability for, and the recording of, all public
                expenditure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I assure Mr Dallat and other Members that the
                Executive are committed to high standards in the handling of
                public money in Northern Ireland. Important lessons have been
                drawn from the cases to which I referred, and those are being
                taken on board in Departments by accounting officers. My
                Department is supporting the Public Accounts Committee in its
                work on the matter. Problems have been identified, action has
                been taken, and there will be other follow-up measures.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me make it clear that I welcome the work
                and the reports of the Public Accounts Committee in that area,
                and I commend the Committee for drawing our attention to several
                important issues.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dallat:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank everyone who participated in the
                debate, and I especially thank the Minister for his positive
                response. The misuse of credit cards to date, together with the
                potential for further abuse, must be dealt with head-on — we
                have received that assurance. The incidences of credit card
                abuse that were described have been extremely embarrassing to
                the Departments involved and have greatly undermined public
                confidence in the Administration.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Key questions were raised today, which the
                Minister addressed. Are the cards required? A question that has
                been emphasised repeatedly is: are adequate controls in place?
                More importantly, have the controls been implemented? Are the
                cards being used only when appropriate? Where cards have been
                misused, have lessons been learnt? Have controls been introduced
                to prevent further abuse? The Minister has taken appropriate
                action to ensure that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The only downside to the debate was Mr
                Kennedy’s negative attitude — I am extremely disappointed
                that he has not stayed for the summing-up — and his use of
                words and phrases like &quot;vendetta&quot; and &quot;judge,
                jury and, perhaps, executioner&quot;, although the language is
                more moderate than that used yesterday. I am sure that I speak
                for every member of the Public Accounts Committee and for every
                Member of the Assembly when I say — and if Billy Bell were
                present today, I am sure he, too, would agree — that we do not
                want these issues to become a political or sectarian football.
                Accountability to the taxpayer is too great an issue to become
                embroiled in petty point-scoring and name-calling. I thought
                that the Assembly was mature enough to deal with such matters in
                a reasonable and pragmatic manner. Unfortunately, some Members
                still have to climb out of entrenched positions. They fail to
                recognise that the Assembly has a prime responsibility to
                safeguard the taxpayers’ money.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It may surprise Mr Kennedy to know that I
                listened carefully to Sir Reg Empey’s response to questions
                yesterday on the credit card issued to the Tourist Board’s New
                York manager, and, believe it or not, I agree with most of what
                he said. I welcome particularly the Minister’s comment on
                credit cards that</p>

                properly control credit card expenditure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not, however, want to end on a negative
                note. I thank again those Members who made a valuable and
                positive contribution to the debate, and I welcome the Minister’s

                is tied around each tree. There are 719 trees, each one
                representing a British soldier murdered in Northern Ireland.
                However, the Government said that they had a policy of not

                Government face when dealing with the many requests for
                assistance. However, there is a clear lack of consistency in
                their actions, and they seem to have disregarded their policy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 13 August 2002, Tessa Jowell, the
                Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, announced plans
                for a memorial garden to commemorate the victims of the 11
                September attacks in the United States. The Government are
                contributing £1 million to the memorial at Grosvenor Square
                Garden in London. It is important to say that the victims of
                those terrorist attacks have a right to remember their loved
                ones that should not be denied. However, we should also be
                sensitive to the hearts of the victims of terrorism in Northern
                Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Essentially, the motion calls for equality of
                treatment: we wish to see parity of esteem. The families of the
                victims of 11 September should be able to remember their loved
                ones through a Government-financed memorial, and so too should
                the families of the victims of terrorism in Northern Ireland.
                Security personnel and civilians who died as a result of
                terrorism should be recognised.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What have our Government done to remember the
                two people killed in the London docklands bomb in February 1996?
                In April 1993, an IRA bomb in Bishopsgate in London killed one
                person and injured 44. Just one year before that, three people
                were killed by an IRA bomb outside the Baltic Exchange in
                London. As far as I am aware, the Government have not directly
                funded any memorial for military personnel or civilians killed
                during the troubles.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There may be some confusion about whether we
                are calling for a separate memorial garden for civilians killed
                as a result of terrorism. The primary reason for the motion is
                to call on the Government to consistently adhere to their
                policy. For example, they should fund the plaques that Rita
                Restorick has been calling for. However, there is an argument
                that a memorial garden should be set up for civilian victims,
                funded by the Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While I was drafting this speech, I was
                amazed to find that the Government had consulted the families of
                victims of 11 September. What consultation have the Government
                undertaken recently with the families of the victims that I
                mentioned? The Government should not add to the pain and
                suffering of those families; they should be proud of those who,
                despite what some may suggest, lost their lives protecting
                everyone in Northern Ireland, regardless of which community they
                belonged to. I have a duty to those who were murdered because
                they paid the price for protecting me and you in this Province.
                Ironically, those soldiers protected the lives of people who
                will undoubtedly be opposed to the motion for political reasons.
                I hope that we will be able to have a sensible debate, and that
                we will not be dragged into the sectarian gutter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is vital to point out that, for the 719
                British soldiers murdered, few murderers have been convicted.
                Families find it hard to deal with that pain, and our Government’s
                hypocrisy and double standards are only another kick in the
                teeth. While Her Majesty’s Government marked time, and, in
                doing so, offended many good and broken-hearted citizens, an
                event took place that was most offensive to those who had lost
                loved ones in the terrorist campaign. A gala dinner, held in
                Dublin some months ago, was organised by the IRA and graced —
                wait for it — by Sinn Féin’s Gerry Adams and Martin
                McGuinness. Relatives were presented with a gold Easter lily for
                each of their dead.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That shows that an illegal army grouping is
                admired and recognised. Those terrorists who destroyed so many
                and so much over the past 30 years are seen as heroes because
                they destroyed so many people and broke so many hearts and
                homes. Meanwhile, all those innocents who suffer and sorrow over
                their loved ones wait in vain for some official recognition of
                the ash grove. That is due to an entrenched Ministry of Defence
                culture that says that when in the slightest doubt, it is best
                to do absolutely nothing. Nobody would ever say so publicly, but
                some officials, officers and politicians are bending over
                backwards not to offend the paramilitary groups in Northern
                Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I think specifically of the many innocent
                victims who went out to do their daily chores and never returned
                to their loved ones. They had no intent to murder and maim. They
                did not go out in a premeditated fashion to murder anyone,
                whereas terrorists go out to destroy by whatever means.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I think deeply about the atrocities at La Mon
                House; Teebane; Greysteel; my home town of Enniskillen some 15
                years ago; Kingsmills; Claudy, currently in the news due to the
                allegations coming to the fore; and Omagh, the worst atrocity in
                size. Those were terrible acts and inhumane deeds against a
                community. Are they ever pardonable? They are but a few of the
                brutal acts of aggression perpetrated against this community.
                Concentrate your mind on the blood, broken bodies and broken
                hearts in the aftermath. Those hearts and minds were torn
                asunder, never to be the same again. What a horrible thought.
                What an affliction upon so many innocents, yet recognition of
                those victims is begrudged.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All compassionate people will support the
                motion. Innocent victims are those who suffered at the hands of
                terrorists. Innocents do not go out in a premeditated fashion to
                murder and to destroy. It was not because of any commission or
                lack of commission on their part that they became victims.</p>

                </b>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I beg to move the following amendment: In
                line 6, after &quot;respect to the&quot;, insert:
                &quot;innocent&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend our Colleagues for tabling the
                motion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is right and proper that we discuss this
                sensitive issue. The events of September 11 have drawn worldwide
                attention to terrorism as a gross and wicked evil that must be
                eradicated. When bin Laden and his cohorts blew up the twin
                towers on September 11, he also blew up the polite fiction of
                romantic terrorism, which was widespread in New York regarding
                the ferocious, murderous and bloodthirsty campaign of Sinn
                Féin/IRA. We had to suffer that murder campaign for 30 years,
                but, sadly, many turned a blind eye to those activities. It
                seems that the innocent who were made to suffer so much are at
                last getting some deserved recognition. However, even in this,
                we must tread carefully.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amendment in the name of my Colleague
                Maurice Morrow and me seeks to make clear precisely who the
                victims are, and there is a need to do so. As one writer put it:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;this is in part because the
                mind-twisting of the terrorist feeds the moral confusion of the
                West’s&quot; — the UK’s — &quot;corrupted liberal
                orthodoxy. This sees a moral equivalence between terror and
                measures to protect against it. Believing there is no such thing
                as truth, it embraces lies instead and cannot distinguish
                victims from their victimisers.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a moral imperative to distinguish
                between those who perpetrate crime and those who are the
                innocent victims of that crime. Failure to do so leads to, and
                creates, injustice and moral confusion. The current vogue for
                making everyone a victim is a direct result of the denial of
                moral absolutes, which is the key feature of our post-modern
                age.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a difference between those who were
                murdered at Greysteel, Kingsmills, Narrow Water Castle, Claudy,
                Omagh and, regrettably, a host of other atrocities, and those
                who committed such crimes. Those murdered were people going
                about their normal activities, whether at the shops, at work, in
                their church or in a pub socialising. Those are the kinds of
                people who were hated by terrorists no matter what side of the
                community they came from. They were considered as legitimate
                targets and were thus killed or maimed. They deserve our tears,
                and they deserve to be remembered.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People who set out to kill, maim and destroy
                deserve no tears. Whatever political logic led them to such acts
                did not, and does not, justify the murder, death and destruction
                of our innocent people. Their names should be held in contempt,
                as they are by decent and honourable people. They committed
                atrocities and heinous crimes against innocent people, and their
                names should not be recorded on any memorial bearing victims’
                names. Many people find it sickening that those who have been
                active in terrorism, or who have supported it, try to excuse
                themselves by claiming an affinity with, and to be included in,
                the concept of a victim.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no moral equivalence between a
                bomber and a victim. We hear the sentimental nonsense that we
                are all victims. That is nothing but an attempt to excuse the
                perpetrators and to shift the blame to the innocent victims —
                as if they were partly responsible for the crime. It is to say
                that victims were responsible for their own deaths or injuries
                at the hands of terrorists. That does a double disservice to the
                victim and is morally repugnant to all right-thinking people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is imperative that a distinction be made
                clearly today. If it is not, the Assembly will demonstrate that
                it lacks the moral principles to distinguish between right and
                wrong. Are we to say that there is a similarity between the
                terrorists and the workmen murdered at Teebane, or those
                murdered in the bookie’s shop on the Ormeau Road? I do not
                think so. So long as the command not to murder remains, the
                distinction between the victim and the perpetrator will also
                remain.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have spoken to victims’ groups on many
                occasions. It always came across clearly that they did not want
                to be remembered alongside those who claimed to be victims but
                were really perpetrators of heinous crimes. It was also clear
                that terrorists, from whatever side of the community, had a
                choice. People in Greysteel, enjoying a pint with their
                neighbours and friends, did not have a choice about being
                murdered: it was placed on them, and crime and murder prevailed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Terrorists do not understand exactly what has
                happened. They had the choice to go out and kill, or to not go
                out and kill. Sadly they went out and killed innocent people.
                Victims — from whatever side of the community — did not have
                a choice, whether they were worshipping God in Darkley Gospel
                Hall, or having a pint in Greysteel or anywhere else across the
                country. Gunmen came in and murdered them in front of everyone.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Hendron:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On Friday 28 June I held my last surgery in
                primary care — I had been in practice for around 40 years. I
                could go on for hours, as could many Members, about the victims
                who were slaughtered and about the families who are still trying
                to pick up the pieces.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like other Members, I attended the funerals
                and looked into the graves — some of the people had been my
                patients. I remember attending to a young soldier on the Falls
                Road as he breathed his last breath. Everything that I have been
                taught and every feeling that I have makes me deeply resentful
                of taking human life, no matter whose life it is. No person has
                a right to take anyone else’s life — whether inside or
                outside the womb — and I feel very strongly about that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In all my years in primary care I had much
                experience of dealing with families who have had someone taken
                away. It was usually the father who was taken, although
                occasionally it was the mother. We had the case of Jean
                McConville, the mother of 10, who has been mentioned again
                recently.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also deeply resent the fact that young
                families are reared without their fathers every day of the week
                and every week of the year. It is not surprising that some of
                those young children, partly because of what happened to their
                fathers, become involved in the wrong activities, even
                paramilitary activities. I could go on for hours about that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have talked about those who have died; but
                there are also the injured bodies. I have known several
                policemen who have suffered horrific injuries. One or two of
                them are in wheelchairs, and their suffering continues. Children
                who are now adults still carry scars. However, it is not only
                about the scars on people’s bodies, but about the scars on
                people’s hearts and on the two communities in Northern
                Ireland. I think it was Churchill who said that the alternative
                to peace was war. However, the reverse is also true: the
                alternative to war is peace.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly has no control over demands made
                of the Government in Britain. The idea of a memorial garden for
                all the victims of the troubles is a good one in principle, but
                it must be achieved through a broad political consensus. The
                location of such a garden, its nature and style, and whom it
                should commemorate are important considerations. That consensus
                should involve Nationalists, Republicans, Unionists and
                Loyalists; otherwise it becomes a points-scoring exercise. We
                have only to think of Loyalist and Republican memorials and the
                strife, division and hatred that they cause. Consensus has not
                been reached, because the community has not come to terms with
                its history. Therefore, the question is premature.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All victims of the troubles should be
                acknowledged, both individually and collectively. We have
                supported the Executive’s extensive proposals for assisting
                victims. We have advocated the establishment, from public funds,
                of a centre for reconciliation, which would contain a
                state-of-the-art audio-visual archive in a central public
                building. Such a centre would allow visitors to hear testimonies
                from victims or their families. That has happened in South
                Africa. Moreover we would see what was happening in the process
                of cross-community reconciliation, and we approve of an annual
                day of reconciliation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I often wonder what we can do for those who
                have died. My party has made proposals in that regard. However,
                some people would say that the mightiest voice of all is the
                voice of God, and I accept that. As a Christian, I remember the
                words of the old song:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;If those lips could only speak</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If those eyes could only see&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If only those who have been killed could
                speak to us. I have no monopoly on what they might say, but I
                feel in my heart that they would not want revenge or war. They
                would want peace for their families and a future for their
                children. It is important to remember the dead, but let us help
                those who have suffered. I know that many are trying to do that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Above all, the biggest tribute that we could
                pay to the dead of Northern Ireland — whether soldiers, police

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
                Tá cúpla focal le rá agam. While the institutions of the Good
                Friday Agreement head for collapse, we have yet another
                selective motion on victims from the Ulster Unionist Party.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are two parts to the motion. The first
                part deals with the events of 11 September. I have no difficulty
                in recognising the heartache, suffering, loss and grief of the
                families of all the victims of the attack on the twin towers.
                That part of the motion makes no distinction between any of the
                victims of that terrible event. It equally recognises Irish
                Americans, English Americans, other nationalities and ethnic
                groups; it makes no distinction between blacks, whites and
                people from other ethnic backgrounds; and it gives equal
                recognition to the manual workers who were carrying out
                maintenance work on the building and to the company executives
                who worked there — all of whom perished.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Member accept that the point about
                the memorial in London is that it does draw a distinction? It
                draws a distinction between those who died in the twin towers as
                a result of terrorism and those who were sadly responsible for
                flying the aircraft into the towers — the terrorists. That is
                the crucial distinction. What the Member says, therefore, is not
                relevant.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McNamee:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not accept that my remarks are not
                relevant. All the victims of the events of 11 September are
                equally recognised in the terms of this motion. There should be
                no distinction between the victims. All the victims and their
                families should receive equal recognition.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the second part of the motion calls
                for the finance to create a memorial garden</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;to the victims who died as a result of
                terrorism in this part of the United Kingdom&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Who will define terrorism? Members know what
                the Ulster Unionist Party and others mean by the
                &quot;victims&quot; of terrorism. They focus first on the
                victims of IRA and Republican actions and then, selectively, on
                the victims of other paramilitary groups. In doing so, they
                exclude the victims of British state forces and the victims of
                British collusion in this part of Ireland and in the rest of
                Ireland. The motion refers to victims in this part of Ireland
                and, in doing so, excludes victims in the rest of Ireland and in
                Britain.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion excludes the families of the
                victims of the Monaghan and Dublin bombings. That exclusive
                approach to victims is part of a wider and deeper problem in
                Unionism. We are eight years into the peace process, yet
                Unionists seem not to be prepared to accept that conflict
                resolution means a recognition of all victims of the conflict
                equally. There can be no hierarchy of victims.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The section of the Good Friday Agreement
                titled &quot;Reconciliation and Victims of Violence&quot; states

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Please bear with me, Mr McNamee. Yesterday,
                during the debate on the Belfast Rape Crisis and Sexual Abuse
                Centre, which I thought was a crucial issue, I was disappointed
                that some Members were indulging in private conversations while
                Members spoke. This debate is also on a serious issue and,
                again, I am disappointed to find some Members carrying on
                private conversations.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McNamee:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker, I assure you that I am not
                engaging in a private conversation. What I have to say is for
                the public to hear. The Good Friday Agreement states that it is
                essential to &quot;acknowledge&quot; and &quot;address&quot; the
                issues of all victims. Republicans have publicly acknowledged
                the suffering of all victims, but I do not hear anything from
                Unionists thus far that recognises or acknowledges all the
                victims of the conflict.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my constituency of Newry and Armagh, Peter
                Cleary was abducted and shot dead. He was unarmed and had been
                searched, and he was shot dead by members of the British Army.
                Majella O’Hare was a schoolgirl when she was shot dead by
                members of the Parachute Regiment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion seeks to exclude the families of
                those victims and to deny their loss and suffering. Many people
                are observing the current situation, the Ulster Unionist Party
                and the political institutions that arose from the Good Friday
                Agreement. There is a belief that Ulster Unionism is walking
                away from the agreement before it walks away from the
                institutions in January. Another paragraph in the Good Friday
                Agreement says that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;It is recognised that victims have a
                right to remember as well as to contribute to a changed society.
                The achievement of a peaceful and just society would be the true
                memorial to the victims of violence.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The DUP has tabled an amendment that seeks to
                exclude victims’ families further. It wishes to reduce the
                recognition of victims to &quot;innocent&quot; victims. Who will
                determine whether victims were innocent? Will the DUP decide?
                The DUP seeks to label some victims as innocent and, by
                implication, others as guilty. We have heard a great deal about
                the victims of Republican violence, and I acknowledge and accept
                the suffering that the actions of Republicans and the IRA have
                caused to the victims and their families. However, in recent
                months, Loyalist violence has been responsible for taking people’s
                lives, and for making women widows and children parentless. That
                violence represents the greatest threat to the peace process and
                the process of reconciliation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support a call for the British Government
                to finance a memorial garden to acknowledge all the victims of
                the conflict here over the past 30 years. Sinn Féin is willing
                to acknowledge the suffering of all victims, including those to
                whom Mr Foster and Mr Berry referred. However, it will not
                support a motion that seeks to remember some victims and exclude
                others.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is right and proper that Her Majesty’s
                Government provide and fund a memorial garden to commemorate the
                victims of the 11 September attacks. They were victims of
                appalling acts of terrorism against democracy and freedom. On 13
                August, Tessa Jowell, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media
                and Sport at Westminster, referred to the memorial garden for
                the 11 September victims. She stated:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Our intention is to provide a garden
                that will be simple, dignified and designed to the highest
                quality. It will also allow for privacy and seclusion for
                visitors. The families affected have, of course, been consulted
                and the design draws on their suggestions.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the same rights should apply to the
                innocent victims who died as a result of terrorism in Northern
                Ireland. It is essential that Her Majesty’s Government treat
                them equally. Regrettably, instead of the victims being treated
                with dignity and respect, Her Majesty’s Government are
                treating them in a disgraceful way for political expediency. It
                is a scandal that relatives of servicemen who were murdered in
                Northern Ireland must pay £100 each if they want a permanent
                memorial plaque erected in memory of their loved ones. A date
                has not even been arranged for the dedication of a memorial
                garden at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire. Some
                regiments have agreed to pay for plaques, but others have said
                that the cost is prohibitive, as they have lost so many men.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is appalling that the victims’ families
                have been left to pay for memorial plaques for their loved ones
                who made the supreme sacrifice for their country against the
                evils of terrorism. A special dedication service for the
                innocent victims of terrorism in Northern Ireland was due to
                have taken place in September 2001 at the Ulster Ash Grove
                Memorial, but Her Majesty’s Government have yet to arrange it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">According to the ‘Daily Express’ of 29
                April 2002, an Army source claimed that Ministry of Defence
                officials are worried about sending out the wrong signals by
                holding an official ceremony while the peace process is at a
                delicate stage. The Army source added that no one would ever say
                so publicly, but there are officials, officers and politicians
                who are bending over backwards not to offend the paramilitary
                groups in Northern Ireland. That is a scandal. It is essential
                that the innocent victims who were murdered as a result of
                terrorism here receive the same respect from Her Majesty’s
                Government as the victims of 11 September.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the amended motion. A distinction
                must be made between the innocent victims murdered by the evils
                of terrorism and the terrorists who perpetrated such atrocities.
                All decent, law-abiding people know the difference. However, the
                tablers of the motion displayed grave hypocrisy. They compounded
                the hurt of the victims of terrorists and their families by
                placing the political wing of the Provisional IRA in the
                Government of Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The families of those murdered by terrorists
                are justifiably angry that their loved ones have died in vain.
                The tablers of the motion and their party must recognise that we
                have a duty as democrats to uphold the principles of democracy
                and the rule of law. It would therefore be a fitting tribute to
                the memory of the innocent victims and a fundamental requirement
                of democracy to exclude terrorists from the Government of
                Northern Ireland with immediate effect.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the amendment proposed by my
                Colleague Paul Berry. It gives me an opportunity to highlight
                the issue on behalf of the innocent victims. There has been a
                shortfall in the Government’s attitude towards the victims of
                terrorist attacks in Northern Ireland. I wonder what the reasons
                are for not acknowledging people here; perhaps we are too far
                away. Many people think that the Government feel that they do
                not need to bother with us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The catalogue of callous disregard for the
                innocent victims of terrorist activity in the Province is
                highlighted by the compensation procedure. Widows and parents of
                police officers were offered a few hundred pounds in
                compensation for the loss of their spouses or children. We
                recently heard how surviving victims who tried to obtain
                compensation have been treated for years. It should, therefore,
                come as no surprise that the Government have never offered to
                build a memorial garden for the innocent victims of terrorism in
                Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no sign to future generations of the
                hurt and pain that this country has felt for the past 30 years,
                except the feelings in the hearts of those who have lost loved
                ones. There is no monument to the people who were butchered for
                someone else’s cause, some by people associated with this
                Chamber, according to the headlines in yesterday’s papers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I, and many Members, have lost friends at the
                hands of people who stated that the deaths and carnage were
                acceptable war losses in their fight for patriotism. What is
                sickening is that I can see the faces and names of my friends
                and many others. I have an RUC poster on the wall of my office
                — Members may have similar pictures in their advice centres
                — that has the pictures and names of all the police officers
                who gave their lives in the service of Queen and country, the
                people and their families. Each picture tells a story of
                sacrifice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Neither outsiders who visit this country nor
                future generations will be able to recall the names or faces of
                the victims. That situation must be rectified now. We must have
                a more significant memorial than the poster in my office.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no Christian way to deal with the
                pain other than to respect those who lost their lives in this
                country by establishing a lasting memorial of some kind. The
                bombs and bullets used against the people of this country
                shattered not only lives and families, they fractured
                communities. Every gramme of Semtex and every ounce of lead used
                against the people of the Province deepened the polarisation of
                the country.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Labour Government have not aided the
                healing process; they have snubbed the hurt, the bereaved and
                the angry. Many people are angry about their treatment of
                victims. The Labour Government recognise Her Majesty’s
                subjects who died in America — as do we — or those who died
                in other war-torn parts of the world. However, they have never
                proposed such recognition of the people from all parts of the
                United Kingdom and Europe who were murdered right on their
                doorstep. There is no difference between the victims of
                al-Qaeda, ETA or the IRA. We must ask why the Government have
                never proposed a memorial to the victims of terrorism in
                Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Words alone cannot explain to others the pain
                and hurt experienced when a loved one has been brutally snatched
                from a loving home. However, a place of reflection and sanctity
                that honours the victims gives families a focus for their
                healing, or their anger at what has taken place. It is a
                permanent reminder of those who have been killed, so that their
                sacrifice is not forgotten and the abhorrent actions of those
                who work for a mythical cause are not brushed under the carpet
                and overlooked in all the rhetoric of the peace process.</p>

                them here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In January 1970, during the Vietnam War,
                Major Michael Davis O’Donnell illustrated succinctly the
                thoughts of the ordinary citizens of this country when they are
                asked whether there should be a memorial to the victims of the
                troubles. His troubles were in a different place, and yet he
                opposed a faceless danger that was similar to that which the
                security forces and the innocent victims of this country have
                faced here over the years. The danger that he faced was similar
                to that faced by the ordinary people of Northern Ireland who
                died on our streets and thus became our heroes, and who remain
                in our past as a testimony to how much we have all suffered and
                how much we have lost. Major O’Donnell wrote:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The veterans of the Vietnam War had to fight
                hard for many years — and I draw the comparison with Northern
                Ireland — before their memorial was built, 20 years ago this
                year. I do not want the families or the innocent victims of
                terrorism in this country to have to fight for long years to get
                an appropriate and lasting memorial to their loved ones.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Memorial gardens in different towns have been
                subject to the horrors of the troubles, and some of those
                memorials, especially those of soldiers, have been vandalised.
                That has happened to a memorial to four UDR men from the
                Strangford constituency who were murdered by the IRA some years
                ago outside Downpatrick. The IRA — scum that they are —
                destroyed and desecrated that memorial, which the families had
                visited regularly and at which they had laid flowers. For a
                short time it was a memorial to their loved ones in that part of
                the country. The IRA destroyed that; they are the sort of people
                who have no respect for the memories of those who have given
                everything for this country.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We seek a place that is dedicated to those
                whom we have lost along the way — one place to which anyone
                can go to learn about the horror visited upon us for more than
                30 years on the pretext of patriotism but which showed us how
                palpable evil really is. It is only right that the Labour
                Government afford the people of Northern Ireland the same
                respect that the victims of 11 September have been afforded in
                England, Wales, Scotland and elsewhere. After all, those victims
                have all been killed at the hands of terrorists, just as they
                have in this country. I support the amendment.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am honoured to support the motion. It is an
                important issue for the thousands of victims of 30 years of
                terrorist murder and mayhem, which blighted the landscape of
                Northern Ireland and which left many without a father, mother,
                brother, sister or other relative. As a former member of the
                security forces, I have long recognised the work being carried
                out to protect everyone in Northern Ireland. Today, memories of
                past atrocities are still vivid in the minds of many people,
                despite the imperfect peace. Although people can move forward,
                they can never forget their loved ones who died as a result of
                cowards and terrorists; nor should they.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have not had the opportunity to visit the
                Ulster Ash Grove at the National Memorial Arboretum in
                Staffordshire — established by private funds and largely the
                work of David Childs — but one day I would like to make the
                trip. However, I have been reading some comments about its
                appearance and the effect that it has had on some people who
                visited it. Rita Restorick commented that a figure or statistic
                on a piece of paper, which represents the number of military
                killed, does not hit the mind hard enough. She said that when
                one sees the small forest of trees, the loss and murder hits
                home much more.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our Government’s policy on the matter of a
                permanent memorial to honour those who gave their lives is
                shameful. In Northern Ireland, more than 700 military personnel
                gave their lives on behalf of their country. However, our
                Government — the Government of their country — does not fund
                a memorial. That is hurtful and disingenuous to their memory.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Her Majesty’s Government recently announced
                their intention to create a permanent memorial to commemorate
                those who died as a result of the 11 September terrorist
                attacks. Although I do not object to that decision, the
                Government should look closer to home and seek to honour our own
                who lost their lives because of terrorists. We heard recently
                how the Ministry of Defence failed to fund permanent plaques on
                memorial trees in the National Memorial Arboretum.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In March, I was disgusted to hear that the
                families of IRA terrorists had been treated to a gala dinner in
                honour of members of the Provisional IRA. Imagine how the
                families of those brutally murdered by the same IRA men reacted
                when they heard those reports. They would have felt betrayed and
                disgusted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In a recent newspaper article, SDLP Member
                Patricia Lewsley said that a traditional memorial would be too
                controversial. I refute that argument unreservedly. What is
                controversial about honouring those who died for the sake of
                their country in the war against terrorism? Certain officials
                have been quoted as saying that an official memorial would send
                out the wrong signals. It is time that our Government stood up
                for what is right and stopped courting paramilitaries.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1998 the Bloomfield Report, titled ‘We
                Will Remember Them’, recommended a memorial to victims in the
                form of a beautiful building with a peaceful garden. I reiterate
                that call and demand that our Westminster Government honour all
                those who have honoured us. They have let the law-abiding people
                of Northern Ireland down yet again. It is time to create a
                memorial garden.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Campbell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is always a privilege to follow the vivid
                and lucid arguments of Mr Armstrong. I thank the proposers of
                the motion and the amendment, and I add my support.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The critical words of the motion are
                &quot;heartache and suffering&quot;; there has been much of that
                over the past 34 years, and it continues. Another important word
                is contained in the amendment, and that is &quot;innocent&quot;.
                That word is a crucial part of the motion. Earlier in the debate
                we heard an attempted defence — if there could be one — of
                the spurious argument to equate those who plant bombs with those
                who suffer because of them. That argument attempts to say that
                he who pulls the trigger is as much a victim as the person who
                receives the bullet, which is nonsensical. If we took that to
                its logical conclusion, we should ask the American Government to
                pay tribute to the suicide bombers in the planes, as well as to
                the innocent victims who suffered in the World Trade Centre.
                That is utter and total nonsense.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, there is, of course, political
                reasoning behind that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is one by which they try to ensure that
                people will eventually be persuaded that this was a conflict of
                equals — that the farmer who farmed the fields was as guilty
                as the person who hid in the hedgerow to kill him. They try to
                say that the bus driver in Londonderry was as guilty as the mob
                from the Provisional IRA — not the Continuity IRA, or the Real
                IRA — who stepped on-board his bus and attempted to kill him a
                few days ago. Their guns were anything but silent on that
                occasion.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The crucial word is &quot;innocent&quot;. The
                community demands that the Assembly distinguish between people
                who suffer as a result of violence and those who perpetrate
                violence. There cannot be any equivocation in the moral argument
                between perpetrator and victim. I, therefore, heartily endorse
                the motion. I hope that the House will endorse it and that Her
                Majesty’s Government will fund such a memorial garden.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Morrow:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The tenor of the motion and the amendment was
                never to be that all victims were on one side. I recognise that
                there were innocent victims on both sides of the religious
                divide in the community. Many people from the Roman Catholic
                tradition were murdered. I condemn those killings with the same
                ferocity as I condemn the killing of those who are perceived to
                come from my community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During my time in public life — around 29
                years in Dungannon District Council — I have never sought to
                take the easy path of only condemning the killing of members of
                my own community. I condemned all killings. I live in what was
                then deemed to be the &quot;murder triangle&quot;, where many
                innocent people were killed simply because of who they were.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I never differentiated in my condemnation.
                When I condemned killings, I did not insert any &quot;ifs&quot;,
                &quot;ands&quot; or &quot;buts&quot;. I was clear and
                unequivocal in my condemnation of the killing of people whom I
                believed to be innocent and who were killed simply because of
                who they were.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the fact that the proposers of the
                motion have agreed to include the one-word amendment —
                &quot;innocent&quot; — because Members on this side of the
                House make a difference between innocent victims and those who
                perpetrate terror. I want to make it clear that there is a
                distinct difference. There must be a clear demarcation line
                between people who perpetrate such crimes and those who are on
                the receiving end of them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I listened with interest to what Mr Armstrong
                said, although, I confess, I did not pick up everything.
                However, one point struck me. He said that the Government must
                stop pandering to terrorists. I agree. However, was it not his
                party that went arm in arm into the talks with those have been
                fully engaged in terrorism during the past 30 years to hammer
                out the Belfast Agreement? The Belfast Agreement brought about
                the Assembly. Therefore, those who were engaged in acts of
                terrorism have helped to keep Mr Armstrong’s party leader in
                Government. Had those two supporters, who would be aligned to a
                particular organisation, withdrawn their support, then Mr
                Armstrong’s party leader would not be in place today. I see
                that Mr Armstrong is telling me that he supports emphatically
                his party leader. Therefore, he is part of that pandering to
                terrorists.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my estimation, 11 September 2001 was the
                defining moment for the free world. On that dreadful day, the
                world saw the awfulness of terrorism at first hand. Was it not
                ironic that terrorism should hit a country that has, to say the
                least, been ambivalent in its condemnation of terrorism in
                Northern Ireland? We have repeatedly seen television coverage of
                that awful event. Hardly a month goes past without its being
                reshown to remind us. As we watch the footage of those planes
                crashing into the high-rise buildings, the awfulness, rawness
                and dreadfulness of terrorism, whether in America or Northern
                Ireland, is brought home vividly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have had to endure 30 years of terrorism.
                I do not remember many presidents getting worked up about what
                was happening here. Indeed, I hold the previous President,
                Clinton, more accountable than any other world leader for giving
                encouragement, succour and support to terrorists in Northern
                Ireland. He helped to build them up, and they are now recognised
                as statesmen. They have been elevated to the same level as those
                of us who passionately believe in the ballot box — and the
                ballot box alone — to put people into power.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some people sit in the Assembly and in the
                Government by virtue of the barrel of a gun. The rest of us do
                not have any private armies. Until those private armies are
                destroyed, we cannot hold out much hope for the future peace in
                this country.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will be delighted when steps are taken to
                recognise the innocent victims. Not all victims are dead: many
                are still alive. The town of Claudy is back in the news
                headlines this morning. We have heard about a young
                nine-year-old lassie who was blown to pieces while cleaning the
                window of her father’s shop. If anyone was an innocent victim,
                it was that wee lassie. She epitomises what we are trying to say
                through the motion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I urge everyone to support the amended
                motion, without any ifs, ands or buts. I say to those on the
                opposite Benches that we have no hidden agenda in bringing the
                amendment. We do not isolate victims and say that they all came
                from our side of the community, for that was not the case. There
                were victims on both sides of the community. All innocent
                victims should be recognised equally.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, we draw a clear distinction between
                perpetrators and sufferers. It is imperative that the two are
                not mixed up, because to do so would be to be highly offensive.
                It would be an insult for the real victims if those who
                perpetrated crimes were remembered by the same memorial as those
                who are now in their graves because of those crimes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I use but one illustration; I could use
                hundreds of others. For instance, how would the families of
                those killed in the fish shop on Shankill Road feel if the
                person who planted the bomb and the victims of that bomb were
                all classed as victims? It is not acceptable. We want to
                recognise the real victims, irrespective of which section of the
                community they came from, and I urge the Assembly to follow
                suit.</p>

                involves providing a memorial to the British victims murdered in
                that atrocity. I was pleased that many Members agreed that such
                a memorial should be provided to commemorate that dreadful
                event.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion is also intended to encourage and
                persuade Her Majesty’s Government to recognise the great
                sacrifices made by the people of Northern Ireland and by all
                those who died as a result of terrorism, in whatever form, in
                the conflict here. As was mentioned in the debate,
                recommendations were included in a report by Sir Kenneth
                Bloomfield, but action has yet to be taken on some of them. I
                thank my Colleague Sam Foster, who has already said that the
                amendment should be included in the motion. The amendment helps
                to convey the intended message to the Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many victims’ groups are exploring ways to
                create lasting memorials to reflect the pain and great suffering
                that has been endured in the past generation, and many of those
                plans are advanced. Given the importance of this issue, it might
                be practical to build several memorial gardens in Northern
                Ireland so that relatives could access them easily. Memorial
                centres would complement any national or regional memorial
                dedicated to the innocent victims who were caught up in the
                conflict here. I trust that, as groups advance their local
                proposals, they will receive practical and financial support to
                construct those memorial gardens.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is essential that soldiers from regiments
                based in the UK mainland and Commonwealth countries who died
                defending the law-abiding people of Northern Ireland be
                remembered in memorials created here. I represent a constituency
                in which many members of the security forces lost their lives,
                and I recognise that the memory of everyone who died should be
                cherished.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some have questioned the purpose of memorial
                gardens. I see them as a place for quiet reflection, where
                relatives could express their grief, but also gain comfort,
                great support and encouragement as they seek to rebuild their
                lives. They would be seen as symbols of renewal and
                reconciliation and would generate hope and inspire people to
                look to the future. They could provide opportunities for
                training and employment, as well as allowing others to share the
                great deep emotions that the victims have unfortunately
                experienced.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In his opening remarks, Mr Foster referred to
                Mrs Rita Restorick’s campaign for a memorial in the Ulster Ash
                Grove. Bessbrook Mill is the main base for the security forces
                in south Armagh, and in its inner courtyard, memorial trees have
                been planted and named, and plaques have been erected to
                commemorate the past generation of soldiers who lost their
                lives. Unfortunately, given the nature of that installation,
                public access is restricted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr Berry, whose moral distinctions
                were correct. He outlined that there was a choice between right
                and wrong.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Joe Hendron for his almost lone
                presence on behalf of the SDLP, and acknowledge his well-known
                opposition to all levels of violence, especially in the
                constituency that he represents here, and that he has
                represented in Westminster. I should like, at the very least, to
                acknowledge his presence and his contribution.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In respect of the comments of the Sinn Féin
                Member, Mr McNamee, if these institutions are heading for
                collapse, the fault clearly lies with the Republican movement.
                There is a very great difference between innocent victims and
                the victims of self-inflicted violence, which has been the
                pattern of Northern Ireland’s history in recent years.
                Furthermore, Mr McNamee referred to the Dublin and Monaghan
                bombings. I remind him that the text of the motion leaves that
                area outside this jurisdiction.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr Boyd, and agree that it is
                scandalous that the Ministry of Defence does not move forward,
                even in respect of memorial payments in other parts of the
                United Kingdom.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I acknowledge the support of Jim Shannon, and
                I share his concern that the recognition of this issue is, in
                some places, highly selective, especially at Westminster.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Colleagues Billy Armstrong and Sam Foster
                condemned the recent jamboree organised by the IRA, at which,
                apparently, medals were handed out. It remains to be seen
                whether that is the clearest sign so far that the war is over,
                but it seriously offended the law-abiding people from both of
                Northern Ireland’s main traditions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr Campbell and Mr Morrow for their
                clear support for the motion and for the amendment. Mr Morrow
                reminded the House that the Ulster Unionist Party had
                co-operated to some extent with what might be termed the
                Loyalist parties in the House, and he criticised the party for
                that. I remind him that when the Loyalist paramilitaries
                announced their ceasefire they expressed abject remorse to the
                victims of their violence. Rather unfortunately, Mr Morrow
                criticised my Colleague Billy Armstrong. Mr Armstrong wore the
                uniform of the security forces — something that cannot be said
                by every Member of the House — and helped — <i>[Interruption].</p>

                was an implied criticism of Mr Morrow. Mr Morrow was a member of
                Her Majesty’s security forces; therefore, I do not want to
                hear any snide remarks from Mr Kennedy. He ought to have given

                service in the security forces but I do, at least, recognise
                that Mr Armstrong made a contribution, as did other Members.

                this spirit to create a lasting memorial to the innocent victims

                During the debate on credit card abuse, Conor Murphy questioned
                whether I had registered an interest as a member of the Northern
                Ireland Tourist Board between 1996 and 1998. The relevant Clerk
                has advised me that there is no need for former members of the
