		  <td><p class="H1DocumentHeading">NORTHERN    IRELAND ASSEMBLY</p>
		    <p class="H2DocumentDate">Tuesday 12 June 2007</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 10.30 am (Mr Speaker in the  Chair).</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
		    <p class="H3SectionHeading">Executive Committee Business</p>
		    <p class="H4StageHeading">Welfare Reform Bill<br>
		      Second Stage</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong><span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">The Minister for Social Development (Ms Ritchie)</span></strong>: I beg to move</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Second Stage of the Welfare Reform Bill [NIA 1/07]  be agreed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Welfare Reform Bill makes provision corresponding to  the Welfare Reform Act 2007 and is therefore a parity measure. Following the  Bill&rsquo;s First Stage, I outlined the policy of parity and social security and the  arguments for maintaining this long-standing policy, not least of which is  financial reality. I trust that all Members accept the benefits of parity.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As a society, we cannot afford to be denied the skills and  talents of many people who want to work but who, in the past, found themselves  excluded from the workplace due to disability or incapacity. More importantly,  we cannot deny such people the right to work if we can help them to do so. We  are all too well aware of the corrosive effect of economic inactivity, not just  for individuals but for entire communities.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill aims to break, once and for all, the idea that  people should be consigned to a life on benefit simply because of a health  condition or a disability. Although the aim is to help everyone play an active  role in society, there is no question of moving away from the firm foundation of a sound medical assessment of each  person&rsquo;s individual capabilities and limitations. The Bill has, as its guiding  principle, the development of a welfare system that tackles poverty and social  exclusion and that matches rights and responsibilities.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Part I of the Bill provides for the employment and support  allowance, which will replace incapacity benefit and income support on grounds  of incapacity. <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">The replacement benefit will  incorporate the contributory</span> allowance and an income-related allowance.  It is estimated that eight out of 10 people who apply for incapacity benefit  want, and expect, to get back to work. However, the stark reality is that if  they are on incapacity benefit for more than two years, they are more likely to  retire or die than to get another job.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Little is expected of claimants and, outside the Pathways  to Work pilot schemes, almost no support is offered to them. The Bill seeks to  change that. The new benefit is founded on the concept of measuring and  building the capability of individuals rather than writing them off as  incapable. It offers a radical extension of the support available, which will  be underpinned by the roll-out of Pathways to Work by April 2008.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The new personal capability assessment will identify those  who are capable of undertaking work-related activity, and the support and  interventions that will be necessary to help them prepare to get back to <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">work. As is the case with the current personal  capability</span> assessment, the scores from the physical assessment and the  mental-health assessment will be combined. Following the assessment phase, the  majority of claimants would become entitled to additional benefit in the form  of the work-related activity component.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The personal capability assessment will identify separately  people who are so limited by their illness or disability that it would be  unreasonable to require them to undertake any form of work-related activity.  Those people will be entitled to additional benefit in the form of a support  component. They will, however, be able to volunteer to participate in  work-related activity and access all the appropriate support available.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">For the vast majority &mdash; those who are not in the support  group &mdash; the new benefit will have a clear framework of rights and  responsibilities. In return for the additional support provided by the roll-out  of the Pathways to Work programme, claimants will be required to attend regular  interviews and to complete action plans. There are no plans at present to  introduce mandatory work-related activity. However, the Bill contains a  provision that would allow the work-related activity component of the  employment and support allowance to be reduced if a claimant fails, without  good cause, to undertake such assessments, interviews or activity if required  to do so.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">All claimants will be treated sensitively. However, people  with mental-health problems will be treated with particular sensitivity and  sympathy. Additionally, there will be safeguards geared to people with  mental-health problems. The current gateway to benefit, the personal capability  assessment, is known to deal less well with mental-health conditions, not least  because, in the years since the assessment was created, there have been many  changes to the types of conditions being presented and the available treatment  options.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The personal capability assessment is being transformed  into a more positive assessment that focuses on what a person remains capable  of doing and identifies the help that they need to overcome their problems and  return to work. Specifically, the mental-health component of the assessment is  being reviewed to ensure that it is up to date, evidence-based and deals  effectively with the problems and needs of those with mental-health problems.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The revised assessment will ensure that people with  mental-health conditions are better identified and that their problems, needs  and the support that they require are correctly assessed. We do not want to  write people off; we want to ensure that they get all the help that they need  to fulfil their potential. The personal adviser is at the centre of the team,  which also draws on the expertise in mental health and other disabilities in  the Department for Employment and  Learning&rsquo;s disablement advisory service and the healthcare professionals  who deliver the condition-management programme.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Local experience of the  Pathways to Work programme suggests that people with mental-health  conditions welcome the support and opportunities offered to them and are  usually very willing to commit wholeheartedly to the process.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Since 2006, some 260 people have volunteered for  the support available, including those with  mental ill-health and people with learning disabilities who heard about  the Pathways to Work programme from organisations such as Action Mental Health  and Mencap.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We believe that engagement with the community and some form  of work-related activity will benefit most  people. We do not expect that the power to reduce benefits for people  who refuse to engage with the help and support on offer will need to be widely  used. Experience of the current Pathways to Work areas in which extra  conditions have been imposed shows that less than 0&middot;5% of claimants have been  sanctioned. Our aim is to encourage and to assist, but it is vital for the  fallback position of this sanction to be available where it is absolutely  necessary.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill amends existing  social security law to ensure that the rights of appeal to an independent  appeals tribunal apply to the employment  and support allowance. Over time, existing claimants will migrate to the  new <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">employment and support allowance.  However, the curren</span>t benefits of existing claimants will be fully  protected.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I stress again that the  Bill is not about forcing people off benefit and into work. It is about  offering people help and support to get ready to return to work, and, in  return, expecting claimants to engage with that help and support.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Part 2 of the Bill concerns housing benefit. In particular,  it makes provision to simplify the existing housing benefit system; to improve  work incentives and encourage personal responsibility for housing choices; and  for the introduction of a local housing allowance across the private-rented sector.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The local housing allowance is designed to ensure that the  same amount of benefit is paid to tenants in similar circumstances residing in  the same area. The intention is to provide  a better, quicker service based on simpler  rules, while ensuring that people on low incomes can afford a decent  home that meets their needs.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill provides a regulation-making power to allow  payment to be made directly to the tenant. As I made clear to the Social  Development Committee, and during the  debate last week to grant the Bill accelerated passage, I will not seek  to exercise that power until I have considered the matter further and fully  discussed the issues with the Committee.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill also provides for a reduction in housing benefit  where someone has been evicted from their home on grounds of antisocial  behaviour and who then refuses to co-operate with the support that is offered  by the Housing Executive to help them improve their behaviour. Members are all  aware of the problems caused by antisocial  behaviour. No one wants people to move  from one property to another and continuing their antisocial behaviour. Equally, we need to ensure  that our efforts to tackle antisocial behaviour get things right.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">For that reason, I will only consider bringing that  provision of the Bill into force once pilots in 10 local authority areas in England and Wales have been evaluated. The  evaluation will cover all relevant areas, including  effectiveness, the effect on antisocial behaviour and the impact on  housing and homelessness. Further&shy;more, the provision will cease to have  effect on 30 December 2010 unless a further Bill, which provides for it to  continue after that date, is introduced.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Part 3 of the Bill contains several measures to improve the  administration of social security, including powers  to allow greater sharing of information to improve the take-up and  delivery of benefits &mdash; something I particularly want to happen. For example,  where pensioners are entitled to both pension credit and housing benefit,  common information on personal and financial  circumstances will need to be given only once.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Part 3 also provides more power to tackle benefit fraud by  strengthening the rules in relation to the loss of benefit for commission of  benefit offences by extending from three to five years the length of time over which previous benefit fraud offences can be  taken into account. It will also  provide the Housing Executive with clear powers to investigate and  prosecute offences relating to other social  security benefits where it already has powers to prosecute fraud against  housing benefit.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, Part 4 of the Bill contains a number of smaller,  but important, measures to correct anomalies in the current benefits system.  Those measures include ensuring that recipients of disability living allowance  who are around 16 years old do not lose up to three months&rsquo; benefit  entitlement; and continuing the simplification of the budgeting loans scheme,  which enables the social fund to play a  crucial role in providing interest-free  loans or grants to assist the most vulnerable people &mdash; those with no  recourse to mainstream credit. Part 4 also contains technical measures on the  payment of benefit for bereaved persons,  and clarifies the law on payment of disability living allowance and  attendance allowance to care-home residents.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill also eases the relevant employer condition, making it simpler for a person who suffers from  certain dust-related diseases, including mesothelioma and other asbestos-related conditions, to claim  compensation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The legislation will allow us to harness the power of  modern advances in health and employment support, and to foster a society in  which there are genuine equal rights and opportunities for all. The Bill is a  parity measure, and an important step in the ongoing process of welfare reform. It encourages people into work,  while supporting those who cannot work.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development (Mr Campbell)</strong>: I understand that it  is the intention of the Welfare Reform Bill to break the link between welfare  and dependency. That is to be welcomed. The Bill provides practical measures to  support that aspiration as part of the ongoing process of welfare reform and  modernisation of the benefits system.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister and her officials have appeared before the  Committee. They briefed us on the Bill&rsquo;s principles and details, for which the  Committee is grateful. As the Minister has outlined, the Bill will introduce a  new employment and support allowance to replace the current incapacity benefit.  That new allowance will help to support individuals who wish to remain in, or  return to, work. The Committee welcomes any efforts to help such individuals  and encourages the Minister to consult with  the Minister for Employment and Learning on the resources that may be required in order to provide that  allowance.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The legislation will also introduce a local housing <span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt; ">allowance across the private-rented sector. The  Committe</span>e welcomes that local element and hopes that it will go some way  to alleviating the current difficulties that those  who must top up their housing benefit experience.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">An associated change, however, will allow local housing  allowance to be paid directly to tenants. The Committee is glad that the  Minister agreed with its strong reservations  on that issue. At our specific request, she gave an unequivocal  undertaking to consider the matter further and consult with the Committee  before taking any action.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee will pay close attention to how the Housing  Executive uses its wider powers to investigate and prosecute benefit fraud. We hope that the introduction of  those powers will increase the scope for effective joint working between the  Housing Executive and the Department.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee supports measures that will make it simpler  for people who suffer from certain dust-related diseases to claim compensation,  and indeed, it supports the other provisions in the Bill that clarify existing  legislation, thus making it simpler and easier to understand.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although the Committee will not be able to conduct a  detailed examination of the Bill due to its receiving accelerated passage, it  will consider the practical implications of welfare reform in the course of its  scrutiny of the Department&rsquo;s work.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Before we continue, I remind Members that we are debating the  Bill&rsquo;s principles, not its substance.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I welcome the opportunity to  participate in this debate. Although the Committee for Social Development  agreed to its being given accelerated passage, the Bill by no means had the  Committee&rsquo;s full support. In fact, accelerated passage was only ensured when Committee members were informed that  people&rsquo;s benefits would cease should passage of the Bill be delayed, and  after we received a commitment from the Minister that certain clauses would be  brought back to the Committee for discussion.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is my understanding that on 23 January 2007 the Minister voted against the Bill, in that she  voted against the wording of a motion that was moved by my colleague  from Upper Bann, John O&rsquo;Dowd, and voted in support of an amendment that was  proposed by her colleague from Upper Bann, Mrs  Dolores Kelly. The wording of the motion, as amended, read:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;That this  Assembly expresses deep concern about the implications of the Welfare Reform Bill, particularly the  introduction of a new coercive regime into benefit administration, and  its impact on a number of vulnerable groups, especially those people with  mental ill health.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official Report, Vol 21, No 14, p421, col 2].</span></span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We now have the strange  situation where the Minister is putting her reputation on the line by  supporting that same legislation, which has reached its Second Stage today.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps the Minister  could explain to the House what has  changed in the Bill to warrant her road to Damascus conversion. Although I  welcome her commitment to come back to the Committee for Social Development to  deal with the issue of housing benefit, I ask her if the clauses relating to  housing benefit in the Bill have changed? If the Bill were to be passed in its  present form it could lead to many people falling into debt and finding  themselves on the street for deciding to feed their families rather than pay  their rent.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Has the Minister reviewed the clause on sanctions, which  could have a detrimental impact on people&rsquo;s health and mental well-being if  threats to reduce or take away benefits are followed through? Can she guarantee  that personal advisers have been given the training needed to assess, and have  the experience to evaluate, those suffering with mental-health problems? Will  she stand over the opinions of a personal adviser or a GP in relation to a  mental-health assessment? Have staff been trained to understand the needs and  capabilities of disabled people?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Can the Minister guarantee that clients who attend  work-focused interviews, if classed as fit for work, will move into employment,  and into jobs that fit their requirements and capabilities? Has she seen recent  statistics, which state that fewer than 40%  of employers would employ a person  with a mental illness? In addition, 75% of employers stated that  employing someone with schizophrenia would be very difficult or impossible. Can  the Minister say if there would be any way that she could guarantee that those  who most need our protection from discrimination and prejudice would be better  off were some clauses in the Bill to be passed? Alternatively, is the House  setting people up for a fall?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The information that the Minister is relying on in relation to housing benefit was collated through  surveys carried out in 18 or 19 towns and cities in England that are  completely different from those here. People here are on lower pay, and the  cost of living here is greater. Some years ago, it was the norm, in this state,  that housing benefit was paid directly to  people. The situation was changed to one in which direct payments were  made to landlords because people were getting into debt. They found it  difficult to control their finances, especially people who were paid at the  poverty level, such as those on income support or low earners who struggled to  pay their bills.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Rushing to pass all clauses in the Bill would be a mistake.  The Department&rsquo;s insistence that people will lose benefits if the Assembly does  not complete the passage of the Bill quickly  is an attempt to get it through without any real debate. Members have  the power to ensure that people&rsquo;s benefits are not delayed. However, we also  have a responsibility to ensure that, in the rush to get the Bill through, we  do not trample over the rights of people who expect us to do right by them &mdash;  those with disabilities, those who suffer from mental illness and those who  live in poverty.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister say whether there will be jobs available  for all those who attend work-focused interviews? Many people believe that the  Bill has little to do with benefits and more  to do with forcing thousands of individuals off benefits completely. Let  us not be hasty. Let us make sure that we get the Bill right. Too much depends  on this, especially as regards the vulnerable  groups who rely on Members to make things right for them. Go raibh maith  agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  This is a very sensitive issue. Welfare reform is something that one can get  badly wrong; therefore, it is important to strike a balance in matters such as  this.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I understand why the Bill is being taken forward under the  accelerated passage provisions. However, that rings a few alarm bells with me.  I start from the position that there seem to  be many more economically inactive  people in Northern Ireland  than in the rest of the United Kingdom &mdash; roughly 30% as compared with 20%.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We must ask ourselves why the difference exists. A very  informative report by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation concluded that there are  two significant issues.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The first factor is that elected representatives in Northern Ireland  are much more aware of the situation and are therefore able to provide the  necessary support to people who deserve to receive disability living allowance  (DLA). Indeed, many people in other parts of the UK who deserve DLA do not claim it.  The issue is therefore not simply one of people in Northern Ireland claiming more than  they are due.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The second, and more interesting, point comes from the  report&rsquo;s examination of the various subsections that make up DLA. The report  concluded that in every single quota bar one, Northern   Ireland is identical to the rest of the United Kingdom  as regards perception. The one area where Northern Ireland is different is  that of mental illness. The report explored why that was the case. As might be  expected, 30 to 40 years of civil war has had an effect. The report found that  it is not unreasonable that our society as a whole should suffer considerable  mental stress and that a way must be found to deal with that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I was interested in the Minister&rsquo;s point about encouraging those with mental illness into the  workplace. Prejudice is undoubtedly a problem. Many employers must be  encouraged to take on people with a mental illness. Members should note that in  New Zealand,  for example, 25 times more per capita is paid to tackle such prejudice.  However, we must also be careful that people are not pressurised into work for  which they are not capable. The reality is that people with a mental illness or  a mental disadvantage have different issues than those of us who are more fortunate.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased to report that the Pathways to Work initiative  has been piloted in 14 out of the 35 jobs and benefit  offices across Northern    Ireland. The Department for  Employment and Learning has an interest in that scheme. The initial response in  Northern Ireland  has been relatively positive. However, there is always a danger of getting  excited. In reviewing the work of the Department for Work and Pensions,  Rethink, a major mental-illness charity in the UK, recognised that, as yet, no  statistical evidence exists to show that the Pathways to Work initiative  supports those with a mental illness in returning to work. The situation must  be tackled and kept under review. How we treat those with mental illness is a  very important part of a civilised society.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are a number of issues to consider. I shall say what everyone is thinking: many people think that  DLA and housing benefit are abused. That perception is not helpful to society, and I welcome the  Bill&rsquo;s moves to address such issues, whether they concern antisocial  behaviour or people with recurrent problems who live in Housing Executive  homes. Evicting someone from a Housing Executive home can take years. That is  absolutely unsatisfactory. It is not that we want to penalise anyone, but a way must be found to reduce the amount of  overheads required to manage the systems, because all money must be focused on  the front line.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionist Party is very supportive of the  Minister&rsquo;s proposed reforms in the Bill. We promise to keep the matter under  review. In the years to come, we will, no doubt, return to this important  issue.The ethos of providing a more positive and individual approach to  claimants is also to be welcomed.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">11.00 am</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">People want to work, and the reforms have the potential to  help many individuals, while also losing the stigma of being perceived as not  wanting to work. The proviso is that people who are genuinely not able to work  should not be forced into it. I also welcome any help for people currently  moving from benefits into the job market, as there is inadequate support at  present to help people move into employment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, Government needs to be cautious that the reform is  not just a means to move people off benefits into work. It should be borne in  mind that Northern Ireland has  higher levels of poverty, health problems and unemployment than the rest of the  UK.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Incapacity benefit is claimed by 15% of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  population. People who are on incapacity benefit are generally the most  vulnerable in our society in terms of ill health, educational levels, housing  status and employability. Quite often they are the people who are least able to come off benefits to get into  employment. Government needs to provide meaningful support to them to  make the transition into employment a real incentive in economic and  self-development terms. The aim should not be to merely remove them from our  benefit statistics. To do this there is a need for joined-up services to be put  in place right across the benefit, employment and health sectors.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The independent advice sector should be resourced and  trained to give effective advice and information to enable recipients to make informed choices about moving from  benefits to work. Measures should be put in place to protect people and  encourage them to come off benefits rather than to penalise them. An adequate  infrastructure needs to be established before a new system comes on stream to  support people to move into employment. That infrastructure should include  affordable childcare and meaningful job opportunities rather than mere token  job placements.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is fine to say that  we need to get people off benefits in order to move them into work, but  we must have a safety net to ensure that people have sufficient income to live  on in order not to fall into poverty. It is essential that the new system and forms be simplified. Sometimes even elected representatives struggle to help  constituents, due to the complexities of the process.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">For claimants whose first language is not English, Members  can imagine the difficulties in completing such forms. In addition to benefit  simplification, the Social Security Agency  (SSA) needs to address the issue of  bureaucracy to ensure that the transition from benefits to employment runs smoothly, without causing  hardship.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hilditch</strong>:  I support the Bill at its Second Stage. The Bill has received accelerated  passage, and I thank the Minister for Social Development, Ms Ritchie, for  coming before the Committee for Social Development to seek support for that process, and to answer questions on the  concerns raised by the Committee.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The majority of the  Bill is concerned with maintaining parity with the rest of the United Kingdom,  which I welcome. There are several broad areas of principle that deserve a  mention. The employment and support allowance will replace incapacity benefit  and income support on the grounds of incapacity benefit for work on disability.  The underlying principle across the entire benefits  system should be to target those who are in most need, and to ensure  that those who should not be in receipt of benefits are removed from the  system. Every Member finds that to be a sore  point in their constituency.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The proposed 13-week assessment phase means that claimants  will be required to provide medical evidence of their inability to work.  Although that may concern some people, the majority of claimants have nothing  to fear from any measures that are designed to reduce fraud. Those who cannot  provide the required medical evidence  within the 13 weeks will have benefit back-paid on receipt of that  evidence. I welcome that provision in principle.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Once those who cannot work have proven that incapability,  the focus can move on to those who can be helped back to the world of work.  That is what the benefit system should be designed to do: it must ensure that  people do not become stuck in the benefit trap by showing how they can move back towards employment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am glad that the Minister has recognised the Committee&rsquo;s  concerns about housing benefit payment; indeed, several times she mentioned  that she shared those concerns. I welcome her assurance that no moves will be made on housing benefit without full  discussions taking place and evidence being produced to support any  decision. I look forward to the Minister returning to the Committee to discuss  the matter.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The proposed amendment to the regulations on certain  dust-related diseases will benefit many people. The proposed provision will  widen the group of dependants who may make a claim. I am particularly pleased  with that proposal; some of my colleagues may remember that part of the  campaign for sufferers of such diseases and their families began in my  constituency several years ago. Many people suffer from diseases that were  contracted as a result of their employment. As well as ensuring that not only  can relatives make a claim, making it easier to make a claim against an  employer or an insurance company will be a great relief to those who suffer as  a result of those terrible conditions.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although accelerated passage means that the Bill will not  be subject to the scrutiny that Committee Stage affords, Members have  highlighted several issues. I hope that there will be support across the House to ensure that, as well as parity being  maintained, those aspects of the Bill that benefit the community across Northern Ireland  will be implemented. I support the Bill.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Although the Welfare Reform Bill is an  important piece of legislation, it is merely a rehash of what has been tried  previously. It proposes to change housing  benefit with the introduction of a local housing allowance rate. That is  calculated according to the number and range of occupiers as well as the  locality of the claimant.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members &mdash; and the Committee for Social Development &mdash;  were concerned about the proposal to introduce regulations to allow direct  payment of housing benefit to claimants instead of to landlords. That raises an  obvious problem in that more money may go into a weekly budget but may not  necessarily be used to pay rent. However, the Minister has given an undertaking  that until that has been discussed further with the Committee for Social  Development, she will not introduce any regulations that will change the  current method of payment of housing benefit.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Is the Member aware that the Housing Executive, as I understand, has already  notified landlords and, possibly, tenants about a possible change in the  payment method? Will the Member accept that if that is the case, the Minister&rsquo;s  undertaking may not be realistic?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>:  That may be the case, although it is our understanding that the Committee for  Social Development will consider that matter further. If the Minister decides  not to implement that change, the Housing Executive will presumably be  informed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Tenants will have their housing benefit removed if a  possession order has been made against them on the grounds of antisocial or  criminal behaviour. Other sanctions can be applied. The Minister has said that  those sanctions will not be imposed until pilot schemes have been studied and  their results are in the public domain.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Benefit fraud was also  mentioned, and it is a recurring theme  in social security legislation. Out of &pound;150 million that was lost by the  Social Security Agency last year, less than &pound;30 million was lost in fraud.  Presumably, the other &pound;120 million was lost through error.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It has been mentioned that the Bill proposes changes to the  age conditions regarding entitlement to the care and mobility components of disability living allowance. The  proposal is to alter the age conditions from those who are 16 years old to  people who are around the age of 16. The  Bill also makes welcome proposals to amend the Pneumoconiosis etc.,  (Workers&rsquo; Compensation) (Northern    Ireland) Order 1979, to ease the &ldquo;relevant employer&rdquo; condition and widen the group of  dependants who could make a claim to include, in particular, civil  partners.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The main principle behind the Bill is to support and  encourage more people in receipt of incapacity benefit to move into employment  when they are able to do so. Although some of the reforms are welcome, other  provisions in the Bill may create particular problems for people with  mental-health issues, who make up approximately 40% of all incapacity benefit  claimants. One in six people here will suffer from a medically identified  mental-health illness at some time in their life, and recent research has found  that almost a tenth of our working population claim benefits for mental health.  Those figures are worrying and raise major questions about how the area of  mental health should be dealt with.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A large amount of responsibility is to be placed on  personal advisers. The Bill obliges a claimant who fails to attend a  work-related interview to provide a good reason for that failure within five  days. That timescale is too short and must allow for the unpredictable nature  of some mental-health problems. Presumably, the Minister will reconsider the  timescale.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">When the personal capability assessment was introduced in  the 1990s, 50% of people were supposed to be taken off benefits &mdash; that simply  did not happen. A more holistic approach to  that assessment is required. Examining doctors must be fully trained and  have a thorough understanding of  mental-health issues to ensure that  the test is applied fairly and effectively. It is essential that proper  resources be allocated for that purpose.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although the move to encourage and support more people to return to work is welcome, many on  incapacity benefit will face practical issues. People with mental-health  problems still face prejudice and discrimination in the workplace. Recent  statistics confirm that less than 40% of employers would employ someone with a  mental illness and 75% would not employ someone with schizophrenia. Urgent  action must be taken to reduce the stigma and discrimination faced by people  with mental-health problems.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, a Cheann Comhairle, parts of the Bill are welcome,  but many aspects must be properly resourced and dealt with in a humane and  sensitive way. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  I welcome the passing of this important  piece of legislation: it is imperative that there is parity between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom  in such areas. As a member of the Committee for Social Development, I found it  of great assistance that the Minister attended the Committee to brief us on the  Bill.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Particular aspects of the Bill should be highlighted to the  Assembly. The Housing Executive will be given clear powers beyond its current  perceived remit to investigate and prosecute benefit fraud. That will provide  an effective tool with which to tackle fraud and  free up funds that can be distributed to their rightful recipients &mdash; the  Province&rsquo;s needy. Fraudsters are a blight on society; they steal from the  poorest and embezzle the taxpayer. Therefore, I welcome the provision in clause 45, which extends the period  during which time someone convicted of benefit fraud will lose the right  to benefit for five years as opposed to three years.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, I note the provisions contained in the Bill at  clause 31 and, although it is not intended that the measure will be introduced  until the pilot scheme in England has been evaluated, it must be introduced  without delay if such sanctions are shown to be successful. The public purse  should not be used to facilitate thuggery, bullying and antisocial behaviour.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Recipients of housing benefit should be mindful that being  part of a society that has at its heart the support and protection of the  vulnerable by the payments of benefits means that those receiving the benefits  have been assessed as vulnerable. People who have been shown to be thugs and  bullies are not vulnerable.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Along with the members  of the Committee for Social Development, I happily note the provisions  contained in clause 52, which makes important changes to the Pneumoconiosis,  etc., (Workers&rsquo; Compensation) (Northern Ireland)  Order 1979. Any means of supporting those who are suffering from such  horrific industrial diseases is to be wholeheartedly endorsed. The introduction  of measures to simplify the means by which sufferers can be compensated is  laudable.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have my reservations regarding the payment of a local  housing allowance directly to the tenant rather than to private landlords, as  outlined in the Bill. Like the Chairperson of the Committee, I welcome the  Minister&rsquo;s undertaking to the Committee on this matter. The introduction of  such a measure may have the opposite effect  of its intention: instead of encouraging budget management and the  paying of bills, it could place pressures on an individual who has fallen into  debt and is tempted to pay off that debt rather than pay for his accommodation.  The landlord will suffer, and there is the possibility that private landlords  will be disinclined to offer accommodation to those eligible for local housing  allowance.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is only the skeleton to which the flesh of ministerial regulations will be attached, and, as  a member of the Committee, I look forward to scrutinising the practical  effect of the legislation. However, I remind the Minister that some of the main  concerns regarding the legislation in Great Britain have been about the  impact on those suffering with mental-health problems and the willingness of  employers to absorb them into their workforce. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s earlier  remarks on that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We must be mindful that regulations will have to be  sensitively drafted, so that the most vulnerable in society are not cast adrift  from the benefits system. I am happy to support the general principles of the  Bill.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>: I  support the Welfare Reform Bill. As Members of the Assembly, we have a  responsibility to do our best for our constituents and for Northern Ireland.  There is also a strong need to maintain parity. In relation to the employment  and support allowance that will replace incapacity benefit, it is positive that  there are work-related conditions that build on the Pathways to Work programme.  Will the Minister outline how Pathways to Work has worked so far in Northern Ireland,  and will she confirm that her Department is working with the Department for  Employment and Learning on that programme?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has expressed concern about the proposal to  pay the local housing allowance directly to tenants, and I share the Minister&rsquo;s  concerns. Increasing the sense of responsibility of tenants might be a good  idea, but we must ensure that any possible increase in debt or evictions does  not happen.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My primary interest in the Bill is in the provision for  dust-related diseases such as asbestosis. The Bill provides for an easement of  the &ldquo;relevant employer&rdquo; condition, making it easier for people suffering from  asbestosis and mesothelioma to claim compensation. We must ensure that people  suffering from those diseases do not have any further delays in making their  compensation claims. It is encouraging that the group of people eligible to claim compensation will be widened. Those  who have found it difficult to identify their former  employers will now find it easier to make claims.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are many reasons to maintain parity. Social security is an area with a long-standing policy  of parity, as provided for in the Northern Ireland Act 1998. I support  the Bill.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.  The Social Development Committee agreed to this Bill&rsquo;s receiving  accelerated passage because it was told by officials, and by Minister Ritchie,  that claimants would suffer if the Bill were delayed, and that there needed to  be parity with England,  where the counterpart Bill was passed in May. However, there was very strong  resistance to the Bill in England.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The irony of that is  that there was so much resistance precisely because of the suffering  that the Westminster Welfare Reform Bill would cause if passed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Coalition Against the Welfare Reform Bill (CAWRB)  protested against that Bill at the Labour Party conference in September. It  demanded that the British Government rethink their welfare reform policies and  recognise that the poor, the vulnerable, the disabled and the genuinely  unemployed would be seriously disadvantaged and punished if the Bill were  passed. The Bill was variously described as unjust, draconian and unworkable.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I know that we are debating the general principles of the  Assembly&rsquo;s Welfare Reform Bill, but clause 31 deals  with the loss of housing benefit following eviction for antisocial  behaviour. We all accept that antisocial behaviour is a scourge; therefore,  Governments must tackle its root causes. However, instead of doing so, they  rely on reactive punitive measures; indeed, Basil McCrea referred to penalties.  I agree: every single case does not warrant penalty.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 31 proposes that the Housing Executive be given the  power to reduce housing benefit by 10% for the first four weeks, 20% for a  further four weeks, and eventually by 100% for a period of up to five years  from the repossession of the accommodation. Will that encourage someone who has  been evicted to behave positively? I do not think that it will. Where will the  evicted person live?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 31 proposes that the sanction be withdrawn or  reduced depending on the Housing Executive&rsquo;s assessment of whether the evicted  person has co-operated with rehabilitation, and I accept that that has been  addressed. A lower rate of benefit reduction will apply if families are deemed to be in hardship. However, does  that make the sanction all right? A household may experience hardship if, for example, someone is seriously ill,  pregnant, has caring responsibilities or there are children. Despite the lower  rate, however, a reduction would still apply.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Housing Executive can act with flexibility: sanctions  can be stopped or restarted. That must be a bureaucratic nightmare. I note that  the removal of housing benefit for antisocial behaviour will not be introduced  until the piloting of the sanction in England has been evaluated. Indeed,  the Minister referred to that pilot.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister for giving the DSD Committee the commitment that there will be no changes to  housing benefit or the method through which it is delivered. However,  given Kieran McCarthy&rsquo;s contribution, I wonder whether that commitment still  stands. I am sure that we will hear from the Minister about that at a later  stage.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Accelerated passage has denied the Committee the  opportunity to discuss fully the implications of the proposed changes. That is  not good for democracy, and in this case, it would have helped if the Committee  had been able to discuss the Bill.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We need a Minister who is not only a Minister for Social  Development but who has a social conscience. The Minister gives the impression  that she has a social conscience; however, parts of the Bill do not reflect a  social conscience. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: I  welcome the Welfare Reform Bill. I note with great interest that there is more  enthusiasm from some quarters of the House today than there was when the  original Bill was debated in the Transitional Assembly.  Perhaps some of those parties have managed to make a leap between  grandstanding in opposition under direct  rule and the realities of life under devolution.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcomed the Minister&rsquo;s attendance at the Committee for  Social Development to provide more details on the issues that are contained in  the Bill. Parity between Northern Ireland  and the rest of the United    Kingdom is crucial. I welcome the fact that  other Members seem to be thinking along the same lines. I support the fact that  the Bill ensures that Northern Ireland  is kept in line with Great    Britain.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The issue that received most attention in the Committee was  the possible introduction of a local housing allowance. Although the Minister  gave a welcome assurance that it would not be introduced without further  consultation with the Committee, it is worth a mention in the debate. There is  great concern about a change in the direct payment of housing benefit away from  the landlord to the tenant. Tenants can experience great pressure when deciding  how best to spend their benefits, particularly when at their most vulnerable.  The direct payment of housing benefit to tenants would put those people under  further pressure. Recipients of housing benefit are among those with the lowest incomes, and there are many competing  pressures on their limited budgets.  Although there is the argument that people should be able to budget for  and pay their rent when in work, the direct payment of housing benefit to  tenants will only put increased pressure on those recipients, who may have to  choose whether to use that money to pay their rent or to heat their homes in  order to keep their children warm. At times, that may put them in an almost  impossible position.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My hon Friend, the Chairman of the Committee for Social  Development, stressed the importance of that issue to the Minister and ensured  that the Committee was given her commitment that further consideration would be  given to it. I hope that she will stand by that commitment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Measures to reduce benefit fraud will be welcomed by the  many honest benefit claimants in Northern Ireland. The Bill will encourage those who are in receipt  of benefits to go back to work, which can only be good for the economy. Northern Ireland  receives taxable income contributions of &pound;2&middot;3 billion. As a Committee member, I  was shocked to learn that &pound;2&middot;25 billion of that money is spent on benefits. The  long-term effects of that must be examined. Northern Ireland&rsquo;s economy cannot  sustain itself under the present circumstances. To enable the economy to grow,  the Assembly must assist people to get back to work while ensuring that those  who cannot go back to work are looked after.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I caution the Minister against the introduction of direct  payment of housing benefit to tenants without detailed examination of its  effects. However, I support the broad thrust of the Bill, and I urge the rest  of the House to do likewise.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Northern Ireland is in the  most curious situation of having one of the highest levels of people who are  economically inactive throughout these islands: its level is certainly higher  than that of any region of the UK  and possibly of the Republic as well.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">At the same time Northern Ireland  has a serious skills shortage. The problem of economic dislocation in  the workforce and the high numbers who are economically inactive must be  addressed thoroughly and seriously. Part of the Bill is intended to do that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">People have become economically inactive, are in a benefit  trap, dependent on benefits and unlikely to get out of that situation. We  cannot sit back and allow that to continue indefinitely. It is not good for  those people, for society in general or for the local economy. All of us in the  Assembly want to see the economy reshaped and reformed, so that it responds to  the needs of the community at large.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Welfare Reform Bill is part and parcel of an attempt to  address that situation. Others have pointed out that it is a parity measure,  and it is important that the Assembly supports it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Most of us in the Chamber would prefer to legislate for social welfare ourselves, and we might make a  better job of it, going by the interesting ideas that have been  introduced this morning. However, that is not possible because the need for  parity has been accepted, and that will continue indefinitely.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP accepts the financial realities. A figure of &pound;2&middot;5  billion was quoted as being spent on benefits in Northern Ireland. That is a huge  amount of money; however, as we must maintain parity, we have little option but  to accept the legislation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As with most legislation, there are good things and bad;  however, the main thrust is good. If we are going to make economically active  those who are inactive &mdash; and not all of them are benefit recipients, though  they are a goodly number &mdash; then we have to employ new means of encouraging  people to work. The main vehicle for that is similar to the Pathways to Work  approach, which is a good thing.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague Fra  McCann, who spoke this morning, and I sit on the Employment Services  Board (ESB) in Belfast.  That is a community-based organisation, financed  partly by the Department for Social Development &mdash; and I am grateful to the Minister for continuing that  finance. I am sure that Mr McCann agrees with me. Essentially, what the ESB  does is precisely what Pathways to Work does, but on a community level. People who are disconnected from the statutory  agencies are brought into to a community context where, by talking to  them, advising them and interviewing them, they are encouraged back to work. In  fact, I used the wrong phrase &mdash; some of those people have never been in work in  the first place. The ESB aims to encourage them to think differently, about  working instead of being on welfare benefits, and about getting out of that  culture of dependency. Mr McCann would agree with me that that approach is  working in West Belfast.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  I agree with Mr Maginness, with whom I sit on the West Belfast Employment  Services Board (ESB), which is trying to make a difference. However, the difference between the ESB and  Pathways to Work is that the board&rsquo;s work has been done in a stronger  community setting and in a more community-friendly manner. For many people, the  barriers that have been mentioned exist in  the benefits offices, which seem intimidatory. That dissuades people  from going to benefits offices and leaves them on the back foot.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Those arguments will continue after the passage of the Bill. Many will say that  they want a more innovative and friendly way of dealing with people who are out  of work. I am sure that the Department for Social Development will take those points on board, deal with that matter and become  much more friendly in dealing with people in that situation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The differences among Members are not about the substance of what is intended by the Bill, but the  methods by which some of the delivery will take place. We must be  constructive in debating the ways and means of proceeding. Unfortunately, we  cannot have an Employment Services Board in every part of Northern Ireland.  We all would love that to be the case, which would lead to a much friendlier,  more community-based approach. However, the realities of life are such that  that measure cannot be translated to a wider scale.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McCann and others  have said that the Department must be sensitive to people&rsquo;s needs,  including those who have real &mdash; particularly mental &mdash; disabilities. I accept the Minister&rsquo;s assurance that a sensitive  approach will be taken when dealing with people with those difficulties.  It is important that DSD works out ways and means to engage with people, over  and above the normal, more bureaucratic methods. I would welcome that, and I  hope that the Minister could offer assurance on that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We have had the experience of the Pathways to Work  programme, which was offered by 14 benefits offices. The outcome of those  experiments and that experience will be important in informing this debate, and  I look forward to that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not wish to get into the detail of clause 31, but I  understand why people say that they object to punitive measures and do not wish  to see people, effectively, left without any support in the community. However,  antisocial behaviour is an appalling problem in many housing estates and neighbourhoods throughout Northern<span style="letter-spacing:0pt; "> Ireland</span>. It may be only one family that is causing the problem, but that has a  ripple effect. It is not just the immediate neighbours who suffer; it is the  whole neighbourhood. If we do  not hold some type of sanction on people, over and beyond what exists at  the moment, how are we going to control  effectively such situations?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Such measures as sanctions are possible with the Bill;  however, the Minister has assured us that she will examine the pilot schemes  that have taken place in Britain.  That should inform our debate and it would be useful to see exactly what  happens in Britain.  If there is no threat of sanction, will  people listen? Will behaviour improve? We are all human beings and there  must be some sanctions at the stage when  behaviour is completely out of hand.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That provision is not intended to deal with people who are  simply negligent; rather, it is to cope with a hard core of completely  antisocial people who defy the normal rules of society.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that the Department will seriously consider the  provisions relating to the mentally ill, and that the Minister will assure the  House that that issue will be dealt with in a sensitive manner.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the provisions relating to those suffering from  asbestosis and other diseases. I know, from professional experience, that that  will assist people to bring claims for compensation by helping to overcome the  evidential difficulties in establishing claims related to events of 20, 30 or,  in some cases, 40 years ago.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I have two brief points. I ask the  Minister to clarify her position on the increasing tendency for the Department,  in establishing the personal capability assessment (PCA) and eligibility for  disability living allowance, to require proof of professional psychiatric  intervention in order to establish that a person suffers mental ill health.  That appears to be a growing issue; and I am concerned at that trend. I am  anxious that provision of that proof should  not become a prerequisite. In many cases, a social worker or a general  practitioner is the person who is best apprised of the mental-health difficulties  that an individual suffers.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is a misnomer to call the programme a pathway to work,  since, for many, it does not lead to work. People want to know whether it will  be financially disadvantageous for them to return to work, even under the  present inadequate benefit system. We must grapple with that issue, which  impinges on education, job skills acquisition, further education and benefit  entitlements. We must take a longer-term view on that matter. For many, the  economic calculation does not stack up. In the longer term, a  cross-departmental approach must be taken to develop a better means of bringing  people back to work, rather than tackling social security aspects in isolation.  Members have no wish to rubber-stamp policies that will, in practice, exacerbate  poverty, rather than tackle its root causes.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>: I have listened carefully to all the points made by Members  during the debate. I will address their concerns. At the outset, however, I  stress that the Bill, and its accelerated  passage, was supported by all members of the Executive.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I must also address the issue of parity with the rest of United Kingdom.  I acknowledge that that principle is, to some extent, frustrating to an  Assembly that is keen to pass its own laws and form its own policies. Both as a  Minister and as a Member of the Assembly, I would like to be able to do that.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, I caution Members that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s social security  system is not self-financing. The cost of paying  benefits in Northern Ireland  is heavily subsidised by Great    Britain. During the debate on accelerated  passage for the Welfare Reform Bill on Monday 4 June, I said:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;For example, in  2005-06, to meet its benefit obligations, the Northern   Ireland National Insurance fund needed a transfer of &pound;185  million from the Great    Britain National Insurance fund. In the same  period, expenditure on non-contributory benefits, which are demand led and  financed from taxation revenue, was more than &pound;2&middot;26 billion. The funding  depends on parity. Therefore, when Members ask what reason we have for  maintaining parity, the answer is that there is approximately &pound;2&middot;4 billion  worth of reasons.&rdquo; <span style="font-style:normal; ">&mdash;  [Official Report, Vol 22, No 8, pp261-2]</span>.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Those points must be made. Some Members have used their  misconceptions about the Welfare Reform Bill for party political coat-trailing  purposes.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have a social conscience, and I firmly believe in the  principles of social justice. I come from a family that worked extensively with  people who suffered from mental illness, so I have always been aware of the  principle that people come first.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I now move on to the concerns that Members  expressed. I am grateful to the members of the Committee for Social Development and its Chairperson, Mr  Campbell, for their support of the Welfare Reform Bill, and I look forward to  working with them over the coming months.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Fra McCann mentioned my  &ldquo;Damascene conversion&rdquo;, but it  appears that the road to Damascus  is very crowded now. <em>[Laughter.]</em> However, having explored the  issues thoroughly with my officials, I am reassured about the implementation of the Bill&rsquo;s provisions. My  Department&rsquo;s aim is to support and encourage people with mental-health conditions,  and to treat them sensitively, not to impose sanctions on them.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Full account of the fluctuating nature of certain mental-health conditions will be taken, because we  must respect the fact that people  may be well at certain times and less  well at others. We must be particularly sensitive to that. I fully  empathise and sympathise with people in that situation. For example, more than  20% of interviews with people suffering from a mental-health difficulty are  deferred due to the fluctuating nature of their illnesses. Personal advisers  will be fully trained to assist and support people with mental-health problems.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have already assured  the members of the Committee for Social Development that I will discuss  the issues associated with direct payment with them before we move ahead. I  thought that I had made my position clear, but some people may have chosen &mdash;  again for party political reasons &mdash; not to listen.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive Committee, including Fra McCann&rsquo;s colleagues,  endorsed the Bill. I did not hear any dissent on that day. Likewise, the  members of the Committee for Social Development, including Fra McCann,  unanimously supported accelerated passage for the Bill. Furthermore, since the introduction of the Pathways to  Work programme &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  May I make a point of information in order to clarify the position?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I wish to continue.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  The Committee for Social Development was told &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Please address your remarks through the Chair.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  I apologise, Mr Deputy Speaker. The Committee for Social Development was told &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  The Committee for Social Development was told that accelerated passage was  required; otherwise the payment of benefits would be affected. That was why I,  and my colleagues on the Committee, went along with it.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>: I thank Mr McCann for his intervention. However, I had already  explained the principle of parity and the financial reasons for driving the  Bill through by way of accelerated passage. As the Minister for Social  Development, I want to ensure that nobody will be worse off financially as a  result of the Bill. That was the point that the members of the Committee for  Social Development wanted me to take on board.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  Will the Minister confirm that, when she  spoke to the Committee for Social Development, the circumstances and  rationale for seeking accelerated passage for the Welfare Reform Bill were  exactly the same as the circumstances and  rationale in the Assembly today?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I thank the Member for making that point. I agree fully with him. The  conditions remain the same. Therefore granting accelerated passage was vital,  as is the Bill&rsquo;s content. That is why, because of the principle of parity, we  must move forward.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Since the introduction of the Pathways to Work programme in  October 2005, more than 790 employers have recruited those in receipt of  incapacity benefit.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Dr McCrea referred to mental health. I am well aware of the  mental-health issues. Indeed, they happen to be one of the legacies of the  Troubles. There is no intention to force  people, particularly those with mental-health problems, into work if  they are not ready to do so. I agree fully that we must focus our energies on  front-line services.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Anna Lo referred to language difficulties. My Department is  aware of such difficulties and will take them into account as we implement the  employment-support allowance and the work-related activity requirements. I can also assure Ms Lo and the  Assembly that the Bill is not about benefit statistics but about genuinely wanting to help people to realise their  potential.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Brady referred to mental-health problems and the role of  personal advisers. I emphasise once more that, since the Pathways to Work  programme was launched, more than 790 employers have provided work to those on  incapacity benefit. Departmental disablement-employment advisers and Health  Service professionals support my personal  advisers in assessing needs. GP  advice is sought if necessary. Personal advisers are trained in how to  recognise the impact of mental-health  conditions. I assure the Assembly that they receive a high level of  training.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank David Hilditch and Michelle McIlveen for their  broad support of the Bill&rsquo;s principles. Once again, I have noted the concerns  expressed about the proposal to pay housing benefit directly to tenants, and I  hope that my reassurances during this Second Stage debate will go some way  towards allaying those concerns. I have made it clear that, until I have  discussed the issue with the Committee, I will not invoke regulations or  introduce commencement Orders. To do so, I must be absolutely satisfied, and,  at present, I have grave reservations and concerns.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  This point returns to my earlier intervention. Over the weekend, I had in my  hand a letter from the Housing Executive  that advised landlords that, come 1 April 2008, housing benefit would be  paid directly to tenants. Will the Minister confirm or deny what is going on?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I will make the position clear again. I sought advice from the Housing  Executive on direct payments. In its advice to me, the Housing Executive said  that it wanted housing benefit to be paid directly to landlords.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  In light of Mr McCarthy&rsquo;s intervention and other related comments, I will raise  those issues with the Housing Executive. As Minister, I will not invoke the  regulations for direct payments or introduce commence&shy;ment Orders until I have  gone back to the Committee. Like members of the Committee, I must be satisfied  that such a system would be a success. At present, I have no reason to believe  that it would be a success.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Thomas Burns referred to the Pathways to Work pro&shy;gramme. I  hope that I have reassured him of its success.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Claire McGill referred to anti-social behaviour orders  (ASBOs). Her concerns about tenants&rsquo; being evicted for antisocial behaviour  encapsulate my reasons for wanting to study the outcome of the pilots being run  in England.  Those have to take place first. Nor will the sanctions be introduced until a  further Bill is brought before the Assembly. I thought that I had made that  clear this morning.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am grateful for the support of Mr Craig, and I hope that  my reassurances on housing benefit have allayed his concerns.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Alban Maginness gave  some statistics and supporting arguments.  I can also provide some statistics: in Northern Ireland, 10&middot;7% of the  working-age population is economically inactive due to ill health and  disability, compared with the UK average of 7%. Everyone must move forward to  help people reach their potential. We cannot consign so many people to a life  of benefit dependency. The Department is  asking people to engage in some work-related activity, but it is not  forcing them into work, because I am mindful of people with severe disabilities  and mental ill health, and of the periodic impact that that poor mental health  can have on their lives and situations.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I guarantee Patsy McGlone that no one who moves from incapacity benefit to employment support  allowance will be worse off. There will be provision for any individual  who tries to go out to work but is prevented from so doing due to disability or  illness &mdash; which can happen, as Members know &mdash; to return to the higher benefit rate, rather than having to start again.  All evidence will be taken into account, but the personal capability  assessment is an objective assessment that is carried out by specially trained  healthcare professionals. Mr McGlone asked  about disability living allowance; I will have that investigated and  respond to him in writing.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that there are also concerns about people leaving  care and the need for a joined-up response across different sectors to  facilitate their successful reintegration into society. I will draw to the  attention of the Health Minister the comments that were made today. Gregory  Campbell, the Chairman of the Committee for  Social Development, and other Members mentioned the need for discussions  with the Minister for Employment and Learning about the requirement for resources to be invested in employment and  training. I am fully aware of that,  and I will be having discussions with the Minister. I have informed him  of my concerns on that matter, and we have talked about them and hope to make  progress.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that I have addressed all the points raised today. I will read Hansard carefully, and if any  Member has raised a matter that I have failed to address or that needs  to be dealt with in more detail, I will respond to him or her in writing. I  commend the Bill to the Assembly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Second Stage of the  Welfare Reform Bill [NIA 1/07] be agreed.</p>
		    <p class="H4StageHeading">Budget Bill <br>
		      Second Stage</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I remind Members, though reluctantly, that there is no time limit on speeches.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr P Robinson)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Second Stage of the  Budget Bill [NIA 3/07] be agreed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">This debate follows the Bill&rsquo;s First Stage, which took  place yesterday, and the Supply resolution for the 2007-08 Main Estimates,  which was also considered and approved yesterday.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">12.00 noon</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill can be given accelerated passage because the Committee for Finance and Personnel has  confirmed that, in line with Standing Order 40(2), it is satisfied that  there has been appropriate consultation on the public expenditure proposals contained in the Bill. That  condition has been met and confirmation was given  in a letter, dated 23 May 2007, from the Chairman of the Committee for  Finance and Personnel to the Speaker. I welcome the Committee&rsquo;s assistance in  this matter.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The purpose of the Bill is to give legislative effect to  the resource Estimates approved through the Supply resolution passed yesterday. Copies of the Main Estimates volume,  the Budget Bill and the explanatory and financial memorandum have been made  available to Members. However, for the benefit of Members, I wish to summarise  briefly the main features of the Bill in accordance with the nature of the  Second Stage debate envisaged under Standing Order 30. The principle of the  Bill is to authorise the use of resources totalling &pound;7,922,535,000 by Departments and certain other bodies and the  issue of &pound;7,079,776,000 from the Northern Ireland  Consolidated Fund in respect of the Main Estimates for 2007-08. Those  amounts are additional to the Vote on Account passed at Westminster in February 2007.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I emphasise again that the Executive have adopted the  financial allocations for 2007-08, as originally set by the Secretary of State  for Northern Ireland  prior to the restoration of devolution. As I said yesterday, although this is  not ideal, and the Executive will wish to review the plans in the longer term  in the context of their own priorities, it  represents the most pragmatic and sensible  way of ensuring the continued and uninterrupted provision of public  services.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive will also have an opportunity to review  spending plans, particularly in the context of any emerging flexibility,  through the normal in-year monitoring  process. Any and all reallocations of funding will be made in accordance with the Executive&rsquo;s  own priorities, rather than those used by the previous direct rule ministerial  team.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly has important responsibilities in this area,  and I was most interested to hear the views of Members during yesterday&rsquo;s  useful debate. The nature of those debates means that they are wide-ranging &mdash;  that is important because financial provision is fundamental to each of our  public services. I welcome the interest that  was demonstrated by Members on those issues yesterday. I recognise that,  as Members had a full opportunity to speak on those matters yesterday, there is  unlikely to be a long debate today. However, I will be happy to deal with any of the points of principle that  may arise.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel (Mr McLaughlin)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. In writing to the  Speaker on 23 May 2007 to confirm the Committee for Finance and Personnel&rsquo;s decision to support accelerated  passage, I also addressed the context in which the Committee made this  decision. At its meetings on 16 May 2007 and 23 May 2007, the Committee was  briefed by senior officials from the Department of Finance and Personnel on the  Budget Bill and on the related Main Estimates, which contain the Department&rsquo;s  detailed spending plans for the financial year 2007-08.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee was informed that, because of the timing of  restoration, the Assembly and the Executive are, in effect, inheriting a direct  rule Budget, which requires Assembly approval. This approval provides the legal  authority for the balance of resources and associated cash requirements, as  detailed in the Main Estimates, which were debated and voted on yesterday.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill would normally mark the end of a process, lasting  approximately 18 months, during which the Assembly &mdash; and especially its  Statutory Committees &mdash; would be extensively consulted by Departments and the Executive on the preparation of the annual  spending plans.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although the opportunities for the levels of consultation  that would normally have occurred in the annual Budget cycle did not exist  under direct rule, the Committee received  clarification on a range of issues in respect of the 2007-08 Budget and  on the arrangements for consultation with the Assembly Committees to be  included in the annual Budget process in the future.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is aware of the consequences for departmental  spending and the potential effect on front-line services should the Bill not  reach its Final Stage by 3 July 2007. It was in that context that the Committee  declared that it was satisfied that there had been  appropriate consultation on the public expenditure proposals in the Bill, in accordance with Standing  Order 40(2). At its meeting on 23 May, the Committee agreed that the  Bill should proceed with accelerated passage. I support the motion. Go raibh  m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I look to my left at the crew of the DUP&rsquo;s starship Enterprise &mdash; and a fine-looking bunch they  are too. Surely even the DUP&rsquo;s most travelled voyagers will admit that going  where no unionist has gone before takes a lot of fuel. Indeed, the DUP leader  was quoted in the &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo; on 14 March this year as saying: </p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;There is no use  putting a beautiful engine on the road and saying, &lsquo;Here is devolution,  here is a wonderful form of Government&rsquo; if there is not the money to pay for the fuel, the fuel to run that engine.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That was only a few  months ago, and the cost of fuel has  fluctuated, as have the DUP&rsquo;s promises and pledges.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Here we are, debating  the Second Stage of the Budget Bill. To put that in context, let us  return to 2004 when Ensign Storey and Chief Engineer McCrea were just getting  used to party statements that moved along at warp 3. How they will greet the  Budget Bill remains to be seen. No doubt, we will hear.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, in September 2004, the now Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment, Mr Doods, told the &lsquo;News Letter&rsquo; &mdash; and this is good stuff:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;To underpin  stability we are proposing an economic package, a peace dividend, to give Northern Ireland  a good start to any return of devolution.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Dodds was soon followed in the &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo; in  December 2004 by the now Minister of Finance and Personnel, who was speaking  after a party delegation had met the then Secretary of State, Paul Murphy. Mr  Robinson said:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The whole idea of a financial package for  Northern Ireland in the event of a  comprehensive settlement was initiated by the Democratic Unionist Party  and first publicly mooted by myself in a speech to the Small Business  Association in Dublin back in September.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">What he said in Dublin, he  failed to say when presenting his Budget Bill to this House in Belfast.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Way back, the DUP&rsquo;s party policy compass was set in the  direction of going where unionists had never gone before and taking the crew of  the DUP starship Enterprise  on a journey that it might never get over, let alone recover from. By 2006, the  great negotiators &mdash; the strong men whom members of the party could trust with  their money &mdash; had moved from warp three and were  hurtling along at a roller-coaster speed of warp six.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">&ldquo;We are star trekking across the Province,&rdquo; was the DUP  cry. &ldquo;There are Klingons in the east wing now, Ian. Yes, they are Klingons,  Ian, but not as we know them. They are republican Klingons, and they are  everywhere. Commander Worf McGuinness is on the bridge with his hands on the  controls, Ian. Our own Mr Spock has taken  over the ship&rsquo;s arts and culture activities, and Lieutenant Uhura, God  bless her, is in charge of the environment. The fellow we need to build new  roads is a right trekker. He is not sure whether he is here or there, and the rest of us are not sure either, Ian.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Let us hold fast at warp six &mdash; let us not get ahead of  ourselves. Let us stop for a while in 2006, when the DUP declared that it would  take the finance portfolio. The DUP declared that it would prepare for a Budget  Bill in June 2007 and that it had over a year to show London  who the bosses were in Ulster.  Who would have thought, after what the DUP said about financial and fiscal  imperatives throughout 2006 &mdash; indeed, right up to only a few weeks ago &mdash; that  we would be witnessing a DUP Minister of Finance and Personnel delivering the  Second Stage of a direct rule Budget Bill today?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Direct rule is still laying down the terms and conditions.  That is no inheritance. That is how Gordon rolled  over Peter &mdash; not once, not twice, but three times.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Who encouraged the bravado  behind crowd-pleasing spending? Who  delivered such rashly arrogant assurances that only served to raise the  expectations of the people; and who  disappointed them and retreated from stargazing election promises? The  DUP junior Minister &mdash; one of the &ldquo;I am no pushover&rdquo; financial negotiators &mdash; in  September 2006, when he was speaking at a meeting of the Subgroup on the  Economic Challenges facing Northern Ireland, said:</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;Before the rubber hits the  road, we need to get a signed-up deal on finance with the Government. What  would be on the blank page of that deal? We must identify the critical issues  so that, when we do put our foot on the pedal, the car goes in the direction  that we want it to go&rdquo;. &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Official Report, Bound Volume 20, pSG125, col 1].</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If one attempts to  factor that statement into the Budget Bill, it simply will not go.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On 30 October 2006, Mr  P Robinson, when speaking to the Preparation for Government Committee  about the financial package, said:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;If the package is zero, there will not be a deal. The  package is an essential ingredient as far as we are concerned. We are not going  to the Chancellor to give us something to keep us happy. If we do not have a  decent package, we are not going forward.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official Report, Bound  Volume 20, pCPG494, col 1].</span></span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Where are we going with this Budget Bill?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On 1 November, speaking  before the political parties met  with the Chancellor at Downing Street, Mr  Robinson said very publicly that the financial package was:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;a necessary precondition for any restoration of  devolution. Unless the financial  package is satisfactory, then there is little benefit in any return of  devolution.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Where is the benefit in this Budget Bill?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On 15 February 2007, while we were still at warp six, the  &lsquo;News Letter&rsquo; told its readers that DUP sources said that the financial package  was a &ldquo;deal-breaker&rdquo;, and that if the money for devolution was not enough,  there would be no Government. They also said that there was no point in setting  up a Government to fail because the Government need the tools and resources to  succeed. Which deal did it break &mdash; are we  not in a devolution situation now?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">What is this Budget  wizardry about? How did the DUP go into Government when it is clear that  its members have even broken promises that  they made to themselves? How can they present this Bill today when they  said in their manifesto:</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;If a satisfactory financial package is not secured now, it is unlikely  to be obtained after devolution returns when the pressure is off the  Government?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">When did you take the  foot off the pedal, Ian Junior? When did the pressure stop?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP stated: </p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;If a satisfactory package is not secured now&rdquo;. </p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My oh my &mdash; are we to believe that a satisfactory package  has been secured? Does the DUP believe it,  or is it unable to admit that it has been knocked over, and that there  is no package, satisfactory or otherwise, to be delivered?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP&rsquo;s own words in its own manifesto &mdash; in its  commitment to the electorate &mdash; stated that without a package before devolution:</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;it is unlikely to be  obtained after devolution&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Does the DUP stand by that statement, and would its Members  tell the House that that is their view?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Devolution has returned, and yet there is no sign of a  satisfactory financial package in this Budget. Indeed, judging by this Bill  there is little prospect of it, and as far as Gordon Brown is concerned, he  will move into 10 Downing Street  in two weeks time, giving these great negotiators nothing.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Do not get me wrong, the UUP knows all about roller  coasters. Whereas Klingon ships have cloaking devices, I am afraid to say that the Klingons that we met did  not know when to remove their cloaks of deceit and sleight-of-hand  tactics. As for broken or shattered promises, we have experiences of Government that say little for those whom we encountered. It is not enough of an  explanation for Dr Paisley to say, as he was reported to have done, on 6  May, that:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;he was disappointed  with the negotiations and that Mr Brown should not take the local parties for  granted.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The script was added to  on 7 May &mdash; as Members might recall &mdash; when the &lsquo;News Letter&rsquo; quoted Dr  Paisley taunting democrats by saying:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;All we have to say  is, &lsquo;all right have your little pantomime on Tuesday but we&rsquo;ll not be there&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Well, he was there. The very next day, on that Tuesday, the pantomime curtain was rolled up and the  pantomime performed, with both Mr  Paisley and his deputy playing leading roles in that &ldquo;Come into the  parlour&rdquo; scene, in which Tony, Bertie and Martin were treated to tea and cakes.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">This House is no pantomime set, nor should we ever allow  the impression to be given that we do not mean business; so let us be  businesslike. Let us be open and transparent  by admitting &mdash; more than people have been prepared to admit &mdash; that, in 2007-08,  all Departments will struggle to live up to  expectations; cuts will be made; water  charges will not be resolved; many improvements will not be made; and expectations will be lowered. That is what  the Budget will deliver.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Much has been made of some people&rsquo;s superior negotiating  skills &mdash; the point was rammed down our throats &mdash; but they have been found out.  Those who claimed that a financial package was an imperative and a  deal-breaking condition for going into or staying out of Government have singularly  failed to deliver. That has been exposed today. However, we need to tell the people not about the failures, but how we intend  to make headway despite those failures. That is what we expect to hear  today about the foundations that we hope will be  laid in the Budget Bill. The next time that a devolved Minister of  Finance presents Budget proposals to the House, he or she should also come with  their position on the line.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Last October, like all  my colleagues on the economic challenges  subgroup, I agreed with Mitchel McLaughlin when he stated:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;A clear demand is emerging for the Government to put  their money where their mouth is and create a level playing field for us, the  upcoming Assembly, and a future Executive. They should give us a chance to  deliver a Programme for Government and not destroy us before we start.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official  Report, Bound Volume 20, pSG 172, col 1].</span></span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent"><span style="letter-spacing:.05pt; ">That was the  challenge that was laid down for any Minister</span> introducing a Budget Bill.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In October, Edwin Poots &mdash; who is now Minister of Culture,  Arts and Leisure &mdash; made sense when he rebuked a member of the Preparation for  Government Committee by saying that the Member in question</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;seems to have a defeatist attitude before we go  to the Chancellor. I am quite hopeful that we will get a package. If we  get zero, all the parties should withdraw, including those who were sent  forward to negotiate in the appropriate manner.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official Report, Bound  Volume 20, pCPG 494, col 1].</span></span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">However, we got  zero, and some parties were withdrawn. That was another way of excluding  people to make way for Peter Robinson alone, or for Ian Paisley and Martin  McGuinness together, to conclude the negotiations. The truth is that not once  or twice but three times they failed to negotiate successfully a financial  package, without which this Budget Bill has little relevance to our people.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Having begun with a comment from Nigel Dodds from September  2004, let me finish with another of his comments &mdash; taken from the DUP website &mdash;  from no later than 23 May this year, when reality was perhaps finally dawning.  He said:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;It is absolutely  essential that the right economic and financial package, which was promised to  the people of NI, is put in place so as stability can be achieved in Northern Ireland.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I agree. That is Mr Dodds&rsquo;s most realistic statement for a long time. That statement means that his  colleagues surely need no longer be in denial and can move on from the blame game that they want to continue  playing. This situation is not  Gordon&rsquo;s fault; this is the devolved Minister of Finance and Personnel&rsquo;s  first Budget Bill. A financial package was indeed promised, but it was not promised by the &ldquo;giver&rdquo;. The package was  promised by the &ldquo;askers&rdquo;, who became the &ldquo;demanders&rdquo;, then the  &ldquo;negotiators&rdquo;. Ultimately, however, they have become the losers, and we have  all lost as a result.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  Members will be glad to hear that the duration of my speech will not emulate  that of Mr McNarry. Its content may also differ somewhat. As the Minister of  Finance and Personnel said, most of the issues were thrashed out yesterday.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to take this opportunity to wish Ministers well. I  know that they will all approach the task of discharging important public  functions seriously. Everyone will benefit from that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department for Social Development&rsquo;s budget will be over &pound;1&middot;8 billion, and the Department of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety&rsquo;s budget will be &pound;1&middot;9 billion.  Those are large sums of money.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not want to pre-empt this afternoon&rsquo;s debate on  industrial rating, but I wish to comment briefly on the issue. This year has seen a lower income from industrial rating  than had been planned, and I have no doubt that provisions have been made to  allow for that. All parties will have to  consider the effects of the future controlling of industrial rates.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The budget for the Northern Ireland Authority for Utility  Regulation is &pound;272,000. I was struck by that figure. That office is crucial,  and we could all learn a lesson from its relatively small budget. Consumers and  citizens are seriously under-represented in the public process. That situation  ought to be redressed, and the Minister and Members should think hard about the  development of that issue. Recently, the Consumer Council has made huge  achievements, which, in the context of the Budget, were done at a very small  cost.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The important health, education and social security sectors  need more, rather than less, consumer and citizen representation. An  independent person to deal with complaints should also be factored in; elected  representatives should not see that as an arrogation of their democratic prerogative &mdash; quite the opposite, in fact. Such a position would benefit citizens and assist  Members as we make policy, legislate and allocate resources.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">During yesterday&rsquo;s debate on the Main Estimates, my party  leader referred to a revenue regulator. The Minister responded, if not lightly  then briefly, that he exercises the role of a revenue regulator. However, there  is more to it than that. Independent bodies, as well as elected  representatives, play a significant role in representing the consumer.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">They are not a threat to our position, but rather an  assistance. Considering the myriad measures that have financial implications for the public, it would benefit us for an independent body to consider the issue.  That small cost would be of benefit to us. I urge Members and parties not to dismiss that idea but to consider  it further.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Yesterday, the Alliance Party supported the Supply resolution, albeit with a  heavy heart; we will do so again today with the Second Stage of the Budget  Bill. There is a need to ensure the continuation of services in Northern Ireland,  but my party accepts that it is an inherited Budget from direct rule Ministers.  That said, however, it is also a flawed Budget. No Member in this Chamber  should be under any illusions about that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In line with the general principles of the Bill and the amount that is being drawn down from the  Consolidated Fund, we must be conscious of the interaction between the size of our Budget and the Northern Ireland  economy. The subvention from the UK Exchequer is almost &pound;7 billion. That is almost half the Budget, which  highlights the relatively small size  of the tax base and the very large public sector share of GDP.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I was pleased that the Minister acknowledged yesterday that  that issue must be addressed, and that the answer is to grow the private sector  as rapidly as possible to ensure that local resources are in place to deal with  the demands for public services that the people  of Northern Ireland  are rightly putting before us.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although, in many respects, our economy may be converging  with that of the Republic of Ireland, and there  is much more scope for North/South co-operation, in fiscal terms we are  not converging with the Republic   of Ireland. Judging by  the long-term aspirations of some Members, that issue will have to be  considered. Although it is relatively easy for a population of 60 million  people across the United Kingdom  to maintain that level of subsidy for Northern   Ireland, sustaining such a subsidy would be a much bigger  challenge for the Republic   of Ireland&rsquo;s population  of four million. That factor must be taken into account.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party and I are here to raise issues in a constructive manner. As the opposition in the  Assembly, we are here to hold the Executive to account, to scrutinise,  to challenge and to put issues on the agenda. However, we are not here to  engage in &ldquo;yah-boo&rdquo; politics about who did what or who promised what and has  not delivered it. The people of Northern    Ireland expect a proper discussion on the  serious issues that they face.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although Mr McNarry is not in the Chamber at the moment, it  is worth pointing out that if the Assembly had addressed the issue of a  financial package in 1999, or even as part of the Good Friday Agreement,  perhaps so many opportunities would not have been wasted over the past number  of years. The issue is on the agenda at the moment, and the Alliance Party  wishes the Executive well in trying to reach a positive result.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That said, we on these Benches take a different perspective  on what a financial package for Northern    Ireland should be. We should not simply try  to get more money out of the Chancellor solely in order to distribute those  funds to public services in the existing way. Frankly, that would be a huge  missed opportunity. Short-term relief would be gained from taking tough  decisions for two or three years, but, two or three years after that, the same  problems would remain.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Any financial package must be linked to a serious package  of reforms. The Alliance Party has stressed time  after time that any financial package must be linked to the concept of  investment to save. We should ask the Chancellor for additional funds because we <span style="letter-spacing:-.35pt; ">need</span> to spend money in the short term in  order to change the way in which we conduct business in Northern Ireland.  In the long run, we will be able to generate more local taxes in order to sustain our own economy rather than  having to depend on the British people to the extent that we have done  over the past 35 years.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That message would find much more favour with the UK Treasury. As part of that, we need to be  realistic about setting targets for how the Assembly will seek to  address the financial and economic challenges facing Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">We should be held to account for our ability to  achieve those targets, or not, as the case may be.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">One of the key demands from the local business sector is  for the differential rate of corporation tax to be part of any financial  package. The Alliance Party is very keen on that, as are many other Members.  Under the Azores ruling, we must be conscious  that we need to address the issue of lost revenue as a result of those  financial arrangements. That cost may run into several hundreds of millions of  pounds. That should not be a reason not to pursue that measure, but we need to  be aware of the fiscal implications. According to the economic model, it might  be 2013 before the revenues raised from a  larger economy through lower corporation tax would allow us to break  even, and that is a major challenge.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Budget is flawed because it contains many  inefficiencies and distortions, and it does not address certain challenges. The  Alliance Party has focused on the cost of segregation. Approximately &pound;1 billion  is wasted every year in Northern Ireland  by trying to manage a divided society. That is a huge missed-opportunity  cost. By investing in division we forgo the opportunity to reinvest in quality  shared public services for the entire community. It was welcome that yesterday  the First Minister and the Minister of Finance recognised that at least it was  a genuine issue. The Institute of Directors, and others, such as Mitchell Reiss the  former US special envoy to Northern Ireland,  have also recognised the issue and reflected on it. Division presents the  Assembly with a serious challenge, which it must recognise and try to address.  The Alliance Party is under no illusion  that it can be addressed in one, two, three or five years; it requires a  long-term programme of radical reform of the way that we do business. It is  important that the Assembly starts now, during the comprehensive spending review. Even in the short term, we should be able to realise some funds for  reinvestment elsewhere in the system.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I also want to focus on education. One of the major  challenges we face is the segregated system we are currently running.  Yesterday, my party leader referred to the fact that more is spent on education  per capita in Northern Ireland  than in any other part of the United    Kingdom, but, bizarrely, we spend less per  pupil. A lot of money is wasted and diverted  elsewhere in the system. No one should run away from the challenge of  50,000 empty school places. There must be rationalisation, and we must be  straight with people that the education system  will have to change. The Bain Report provides a structure for change, and I look forward to the Assembly debating  it soon.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party will  advocate integrated education as being the most viable model not only  academically and socially but economically and financially. We are concerned  that the Department of Education sees integrated educated as a further break-up  of an already fragmented system rather than  a solution. If schools come together  or transform, they can create a more sustainable model for preserving  education in local communities.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Education will need to change and schools must be  considered as part of the overall framework. Tough decisions will have to be  taken. We are not essentially talking about moving to an integrated model for  all of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s schools, but it is important that we look for  opportunities to promote integrated education whenever and wherever they arise.  Other systems will, inevitably, survive alongside that, but all sectors are  aware of the need for sharing and collaboration. I welcome that as another approach to addressing the issue.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As regards transport, the Assembly must be aware that not  enough is spent on public transport relative to our competitors elsewhere in  these islands. About 65% of the local  transport budget is spent on roads, and only 35% on public transport. That is almost the mirror image of the  spending pattern in Great Britain, where there are also large rural areas.  There is scope for changing the balance of the transport budget over time. That  does not necessarily mean that it requires additional funds; it means that we  must prioritise our resources as best as possible.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Budget Bill is essentially a precursor to the big  discussion that must follow on the comprehensive spending review for the next  three financial years. That is the  opportunity for the Executive and the Assembly to re-examine everything  in the detail of our expenditure plans in order to see where we can make  additional investments to meet the demands of the people of Northern Ireland  for, for example, free personal care. However, we also need to revise budgets,  and that will mean cutting budgets in some areas in order to reinvest  elsewhere. Our Budget process must be a constant process of change. Sometimes  budgets will go up; sometimes they will go down. Circumstances change. Circumstances are never fixed, so budgets can  never be fixed either. In the  meantime, my party supports the Bill.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Before I come to the thrust of what I want  to say, I cannot allow the spaced-out contribution of the sole Ulster  Unionist representative from Strangford to pass without comment. I notice that  he is not in his place; perhaps he has been  beamed back up to his mother ship along with Elvis and the former Ulster  Unionist representatives who have vanished without trace in recent times. Elvis is more likely to be spotted  than some of those characters.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It ill behoves any Ulster Unionist to belittle the attempts  to obtain a financial package for Northern Ireland &mdash; attempts in which the  Ulster Unionist Party has been intimately involved. Mr McNarry himself attended  several key meetings, both here and across the water, on the issue. His rather  infantile contribution in the Chamber today exhibited his complete lack of knowledge  of what is happening. He said that &ldquo;zero&rdquo; has been achieved. Anyone who looks  at what actually has been achieved will see that it is far from zero.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We have had reform of the reinvestment and reform  initiative, undoing the damage that was done by the Ulster Unionist Party,  whereby we could only borrow in so far as we closed the gap on  expenditure-raising with the mainland &mdash; something that led to huge rises in the  regional rate, and for which the Ulster Unionist Party was responsible. To  date, we have had an additional &pound;2 billion of capital expenditure; at least  &pound;100 million in guarantees for the CSR period; a review of tax policy in this  part of the kingdom; and guarantees on end-year flexibility and on where the  proceeds from asset sales will go. Compared to UUP standards, that is certainly  a sizeable package for Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McNarry&rsquo;s contribution also raises the question of what  the Ulster Unionist Party did in 1998. The answer  to that is &ldquo;zero&rdquo;. His party did absolutely nothing and allowed the  issue to go without mention.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Does the Member not agree that that is a little bit unfair on the Ulster  Unionists? After all, although they did not achieve a single penny for the  Northern Ireland exchequer, they did manage to negotiate a couple of knighthoods.<strong></strong><span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I welcome that contribution, which shows where the UUP&rsquo;s priorities lay at that  time. The party was feathering its own nest rather than assisting Northern  Ireland to develop a better economy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">What would the UUP have done in 2007? Having read its election manifesto, everyone knows that  it would again have done nothing. The Ulster Unionists would have  entered Government on 26 March irrespective of the addressing of any issue.  That analysis was roundly rejected by the  electorate. Were he here, I would remind the Member for Strangford of  the result in his own constituency, where he is now the only representative of  the Ulster Unionist Party, compared with four from my own party.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">He talked frequently  about Klingons &mdash; <em>[Interruption.]</em></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am sorry; I will acknowledge the Member from the Alliance  Party who was also elected in Strangford.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  How could you forget him?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Indeed, how could I forget him? In many boxes that we saw being emptied, he was  beating the Ulster Unionist Party.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Absolutely.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I am sure that he is glad to hear that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There were plenty of  references to Klingons. The Ulster  Unionist Party has been clinging on to my  party&rsquo;s coat-tails. There was talk of pantomimes taking place in this  Building. If any pantomime is taking place, the Ulster Unionist Party is  certainly participating in it, and that must mean that the Minister of Health  and the Minister for Employment and Learning are the ugly sisters.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Does the Member agree that it is ironic that we have sustained a tirade of  criticism from the Ulster Unionists this  morning? Having had the opportunity to stay outside the tent, the Ulster  Unionists decided to take their places in  the Executive. Therefore it ill becomes them to attack the Minister of Finance and the proposals before  the House today.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  The Member makes a valid point. I am not sure what the Ulster Unionist Party&rsquo;s  position is on that matter. I hear one thing from some Members and something  else from others &mdash; surely not a divided Ulster Unionist Party?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Unlike the Member for Strangford David McNarry, I will give way.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  am fascinated by the Member&rsquo;s comments about the Ulster Unionist Party&rsquo;s  deciding to take its places on the Executive. Is that not exactly what the Member&rsquo;s party did in the previous  Executive? Why is he criticising the UUP for doing the same?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  The Member knows well that DUP Ministers did not take their seats around the  Executive table. His party leader and others lambasted the DUP and said that  Members of my party were outside the Executive. The Member cannot have it all  ways.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Now that I have got that off my chest, I wish to turn to  the issues that I want to raise. With the exception perhaps of Mr McNarry,  Members are aware that this Budget has been inherited by the Minister of  Finance and Personnel. It is not to every Member&rsquo;s satisfaction, but, sadly, we  do not start with a blank piece of paper. However, this debate provides a good  opportunity to look forward to future Budgets.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members have and will use today&rsquo;s debate to make a special  case for increased expenditure in particular Departments or on pet projects in  which they are interested. I wish to make the case for a greater concentration  in future Budgets on the economy. That is an area of public policy that has  been sidelined and ignored for far too long in Northern Ireland. Many public services have been so underfunded in the  decades of direct rule that it is understandable that the issues of hospitals, schools and housing dominate political  debate. I fully sympathise with and support those views. However, I  believe that the new Executive&rsquo;s principal focus should be on economic  development, and I sincerely hope that,  when published, the new Programme for Government will centre upon that  matter.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In recent times, Members have grown accustomed to good news  stories about the local economy &mdash; high employment, high manufacturing output  relative to other UK regions and a growing tourism sector. Unfortunately,  Members are also well aware of the many structural weaknesses that the economy  suffers from: the highest proportion of economically inactive people in the UK;  an over-dependence on the public sector for growth and jobs; a small private  sector; the decline of the manufacturing base, which, I am sure, will be touched  upon in the debate later today; an over-representation of the service sector;  low levels of research and development; and the difficulties inherent in  evolving from some 30 years of civil strife, during which time the economy was  often a target and bore the brunt of terrorist violence.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The challenges that  must be overcome were summed up in a report in &lsquo;The Economist&rsquo; from June  2006. It found that, in Northern Ireland,  the public sector accounts for 61% of GDP, only 65 private sector firms  employ more than 500 people and 10 firms account for half of all exports.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not ask that the  Executive prioritise local economic growth  simply to put more pounds into people&rsquo;s pockets &mdash; although that would be  nice. All Members wish citizens to be  prosperous and working in well-paid jobs and for Northern Ireland to be  the best that it can be. The main focus of the Assembly, its Executive and its expenditure ought to be the enhancement of the  economy because a transformed economy, through sustainable wealth  creation, can be the key to unlocking better public services.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier, Members took  part in the debate on the Welfare Reform Bill, and we all want to see as  many people as possible ceasing to be economically inactive, coming off welfare  and getting into work. The transformation of the economy can assist in the  achievement of that noble aim.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not argue simply for increased budgetary allocations  for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI), although I am  sure that my hon Friend the Minister would not mind if I did. What I am  suggesting is a genuinely cross-departmental approach to economic development.  Members have heard that all policy should  be rural proofed, or equality and human rights tested. It is time,  however, for the Executive to insist that  economic development is the primary emphasis of Departments, legislation  and spending.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is an assumption that economic development is the domain of DETI. That assumption is wrong.  DETI has a co-ordinating role, and I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments on  how he intends to perform that role.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">12.45 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Hardly any Government Department is without an important  part to play in rebuilding our economy, whether  it is the Department for Regional Development in improving our  infrastructure; the Department for Education and Learning in retooling our  workforce; the Department of the Environment in reform of our planning process;  the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in overseeing our number  one industry; or even the Department of Education in laying the foundations for  an educationally<strong>-</strong>equipped workforce. Every aspect of the work of  Government is paramount in rebuilding our economy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Finance and Personnel has an important  overseeing role in respect of our economy. I welcome  the comments of the Minister who, on his first day in office, stated that helping to create a competitive  economy for Northern Ireland was a priority of his tenure. Furthermore, I  welcome the work that the Minister has already engaged in with the European  Commission, which will help the Executive and the local business community to  identify opportunities in Brussels to develop our economy and create jobs. That  is a much better use of the EU than we have  made in the past. We have watched other European regions use the  benefits of Brussels to develop their economies, while we have wasted millions on abstract and woolly notions.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is a gross understatement to say that the economy and its development have been a secondary matter  during the decades of direct rule. To pick up on a theme, discussed by  Dr Farry yesterday, government policy has made us, at times, and in many  respects, nothing better than a Soviet-style satellite state, dependent on central handouts to survive. We must end that  dependency culture at every level and  begin to stand on our own two feet.  The best way to do this is to grow our own economy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We have a proud economic history in this part of the world. Reclaiming it for a new generation, and  those that will follow, should be at  the top of the Assembly&rsquo;s agenda.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I support the Bill &mdash; which may  surprise Members, coming from my party&rsquo;s  position. However, we are where we are. The Finance Minister and the  Executive have inherited the Budget from direct rule Ministers and the British  Government. It is a British Labour Party  Budget. In the Transitional Assembly, I brought my single transferable  speech to every debate and stated that we needed to be in power and to make  decisions. Thankfully, we have reached the stage where we are in power, and we  continue to work through a process in which we make the decisions.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Undoubtedly, if I speak in a Budget debate this time next  year, I may have to &mdash; and if I need to, I will &mdash; attack the Department of  Finance and Personnel on its Budget. At this stage, that would not be a  worthwhile use of energy or time in this place.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It will come as no surprise that, as republicans, we want  to develop an all-Ireland economy. We want an all-Ireland economic development  plan, and we want the amalgamation of Invest Northern Ireland and the  Industrial Development Agency, Ireland (IDA), with a remit to support  indigenous industries. However, we do not  want that out of some ideological stance because we are who we are.  Rather, we believe that it is a practical way forward in developing the economy  in all parts of the island of Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: Given the fact that the Member advocates an all-Ireland economic plan, how much of a  disappoint&shy;ment and a setback was the Republic of Ireland&rsquo;s rejection of  that economic plan? Effectively, the people of the Republic of Ireland have  said that the reason that Sinn F&eacute;in was not fit for Government there was  because its economic policies were not fit for purpose.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I thank the Member for his intervention, and his interest in  all-Ireland politics: that is welcome. Before the elections we were told that  we were economically illiterate, and  Fianna F&aacute;il told the electorate that the economy was doing well. However, the  day after the election results were announced the Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, told  the electorate that the economy was going to slow down and that they may be in  for a difficult ride. So, who is economically illiterate &mdash; Sinn F&eacute;in or Bertie  Ahern? Perhaps he was not as truthful as Sinn F&eacute;in was about the economic  situation. I do not wish to digress too much. Sinn F&eacute;in had a bad day at the  elections, but it was not rejected and it will return. The party will dust  itself down and it will be back again &mdash; something of which I am sure Members  are well aware.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The all-Ireland economy &mdash; something that was discussed in the Programme for Government  Committee during the Transitional Assembly &mdash; is a benefit to all of  society. Unionism says that it will get involved in any all-Ireland activity  only if it is practical, and not if it is political. Members will get no  arguments from Sinn F&eacute;in on that matter.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  The Member indicates that he wants only things that are practical. Does he  accept that the rest of the United Kingdom  is, by far, the biggest region to which Northern Ireland exports? The  last figures that I saw showed 45%, whereas only approximately 15% of our  exports go to the Republic of Ireland. It is surely  not practical to be linked to an economy to which most of our exports do  not go.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Northern Ireland, being within the United Kingdom, is part  of the sterling currency regime. It would not be practical to move into the  euro zone as that would add huge costs to our exporters and lead to a whole  host of other complications. Does the Member accept that his proposal is not  practical?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: No one in Sinn F&eacute;in seeks an isolationist policy, where an  all-Ireland economy is formed and we sit out in the Atlantic on our own. The  party wants to work with all its neighbours, and it would be crazy not to develop  stronger economic links with Britain as a whole. Sinn F&eacute;in is not about  isolationism; rather it is about creating a vibrant new beginning &mdash; part of  that involves an all-Ireland economy, but we can also work towards it in a  transitional period, too.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I certainly do not wish to turn this debate into a  question-and-answer session on Sinn F&eacute;in party policy. I am more than happy to  hold one-to-one sessions or to participate in party sessions on the matter.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are a number of  issues, some of which have already been raised today. The Department of  Finance and Personnel and the Executive must deal with the Budget and the  financial package before them. I commend all the  political parties for strongly lobbying Gordon Brown and Tony Blair to  increase the financial package to the North. In very difficult circumstances,  they did what they could do. Those  negotiations must continue. There is  no need for the Ulster Unionist Party&rsquo;s short-termism, or for it to  attack any political party in this Chamber or to break away from that work at  this point. We must remain united and  focused on continuing the negotiations.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Barnett formula is also part of the problem; it is not  beneficial to the people of the North. We must continue negotiations with the  Exchequer on that issue. Sinn F&eacute;in wants the Executive to have a borrowing  facility, as opposed to the reinvestment and reform initiative, and for the  Assembly to have tax-varying powers. If the DUP gave the UUP a bit of stick  about its involvement in that initiative, I may give the SDLP a bit of stick about its involvement too. We must  secure a financial contribution towards the peace dividend from not only  the British Government but the Irish Government as well.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Any Budget from this Administration must have at its core a  commitment to tackling disadvantage and discrimination  and creating a new beginning for people. In the previous debate, on the  Welfare Reform Bill, several Members pointed out that many people are economically inactive. We must ask why that is the  case, and why there are pockets of high unemployment and deprivation across the North. There are clearly  historical reasons for that, and the Executive have a duty to tackle  those issues in this Budget and particularly in the next Budget, which will be  their own.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We must create investment incentives in areas of high  unemployment. This week, the Committee for Public Accounts will consider the  Springvale project in north and west Belfast &mdash; an imaginative Government  intervention in an area of high unemployment and deprivation. We must, of  course, examine why that project went wrong.  However, the Executive must also be imaginative  and must consider how they can implement such schemes in other areas of  high unemployment and deprivation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We must press on with the decentralisation of Government  Departments. There is no need for the Government to be centred within a  one-mile radius of this Building. Areas such as west of the Bann could benefit  from the decentralisation of public-sector jobs.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There has understandably been much talk of the large number  of people employed by the public sector and the role of the public sector in  our economy. I will focus on the health sector. The power of procurement in  that sector alone is massive. Ensuring that that procurement is used to tackle  unemployment and deprivation would be a productive use of public moneys. Many  hospitals and health units are situated in  areas of high deprivation. Therefore, why not use that budget to ensure that  the services that are provided to hospitals  are situated in the localities of those hospitals?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Fermanagh and South  Tyrone, for example, comprises rural areas. Why should the new rural  hospital in Fermanagh not be used as an economic as well as a health unit in  order that its spending power can be used locally? That would be an imaginative  use of resources and would help to eliminate poverty.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We have a responsibility to ring-fence a meaningful  proportion of the Budget in order to tackle poverty and to ensure that  resources are targeted on the basis of objective need. We also need to tackle  ongoing employment discrimination and enhance the rights of workers, because,  after all, they create wealth. Not only are all our successful enterprises a  credit to the business sector, they are a credit to the people who work in  them. We need to do more for the rights of migrant workers, without whom our  economy could not survive. If our economy is to grow, we will need more migrant  workers. If we are to encourage migrant workers to come here, we must ensure  that their rights are protected.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I shall touch on several issues that the Minister of  Finance and Personnel discussed yesterday. I noted with interest his comments  on social housing and his challenge to the Minister for Social Development to  make him shout &ldquo;Give me the money&rdquo; at her. Although I agree that that is a good catchphrase that will no doubt get  headlines for a while, the Department for Social Development has a large land bank that should and could be used  to tackle the difficulties with social housing.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development made a  statement yesterday on rural regeneration. That is the responsibility of  several Departments; therefore, the Executive need to think in a more joined-up  way about how public moneys should be used  in rural areas.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Challenges ahead of us include the comprehensive spending  review, and we must ensure that that is not a mechanism to cut front-line  community services. Education and health will always be high priorities. I noted the Minister of Finance and Personnel&rsquo;s  comments on what the Chairperson of the Committee for Health, Social  Services and Public Safety said about the need for investment in the Health  Service. I hope that the Minister got his tea last night and that there will be  investment in the Health Service. I was previously Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s health  spokesperson, so I support any such investment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister of Finance and Personnel said that we need to  examine our own structures and that we have too many Departments and too many  MLAs. I hoped that at that stage he would have touched on the fact that we also  have too many local councils.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  He meant eight too many.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Perhaps that is what he meant. I hope that he realises that the present 26-council  structure cannot continue and that increasing the number of councils from the  proposed seven to 11 or 15 is not a financial option.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee of the Centre, which may soon have its new  name, the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First  Minster, agreed by the Assembly, was told that 11 or 15 councils &mdash; instead of  seven &mdash; would cost an extra &pound;35 million. Are the Members on the opposite Benches, who support having 11 to 15  councils, prepared to stand over that figure when other services in the  comprehensive spending review will face difficulties?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My party agrees that the number of MLAs and Departments  needs to be reviewed. In particular, we believe that it is not financially  viable to continue with councils&rsquo; current format. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. Members will know that the Business Committee has arranged to meet  immediately upon lunchtime suspension. I  propose, therefore, by leave of the Assembly to suspend the sitting  until 2.00 pm.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The sitting was suspended at 12.59 pm.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">On resuming (Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr McClarty] in the  Chair) &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="H4StageHeading"><span class="H4StageHeading">Budget Bill </span><br>
	        Second Stage</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm<span style="font-style:normal; "> </span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  welcome the opportunity to speak in the debate.  I will endeavour to avoid the pitfall of presenting a wish list for my  constituents in East Antrim, although I will highlight some important issues  that I hope will be kept in mind for future spending decisions. I am quite glad  &mdash; and proud &mdash; that I do not follow &lsquo;Star Trek&rsquo;. I will therefore avoid any anecdotes  about that programme in my speech, which will be based in reality rather than  the fantasy world of some Members who spoke earlier.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As we have heard, the Budget is not perhaps to the liking  of all Members. However, we should realise that we cannot get everything that  we want. It may be a catchy sound bite to  call on the Minister to throw millions of pounds at a particular  project, but Members must recognise that we cannot start spending huge sums of money that we simply do not have. Our task is to  spend the Budget wisely to ensure that Northern Ireland can grow economically and that the people living in  this part of the United Kingdom can  enjoy a better standard of life.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">With that in mind, I hope that the next part of my speech does not subject me to the wrath of the  Minister, as I recall his comments yesterday about individual Members  presenting a number of pet projects. I do not have a metaphorical begging bowl;  rather, I wish to highlight a few areas in East Antrim where investment in the future would see a return for the Northern  Ireland economy as a whole.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The first issue that I  wish to raise is more of a pet hate than a pet project, particularly  among my constituents in East Antrim. It  would be remiss of me not to mention it while I have the opportunity.  East Antrim is plagued by a second-rate train service and, from my experience  of working in Larne over the last number of years, I know of the frustration and anger with the train services that exists among my constituents. I will meet the  Larne Line Passenger Group tomorrow evening, and I hope that the new  trains that they are lobbying for can be procured for the Larne line to replace  the dilapidated trains that are currently used to enable the people of East Antrim to be finally able to enjoy more comfortable  and frequent journeys to Belfast.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Member for North  Down Mr Farry mentioned, improved public transport throughout Northern  Ireland would encourage more people to  leave their cars behind and use what some refer to as environmentally  friendly forms of travel. I am sure that that would please other Members. It  would also reduce the number of cars on the  road. On a recent visit to Carrickfergus train station, I witnessed first hand the success of the park-and  ride-scheme that operates there. Such schemes should be extended and given every encouragement. That can  only happen when people are confident  in the level of service that they will receive from bus and rail  services.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The promotion of tourism is another issue. Tourism is the fourth largest private-sector employer in  Northern Ireland. Although most of the focus will inevitably be on  Belfast, East Antrim, as a constituency that borders Belfast, is well placed to  avail itself of the tourism opportunities that exist. Sound investment in  tourism can see huge returns in the number of visitors who come to Northern  Ireland and the number of jobs created in the tourism sector, all of which can  boost the Northern Ireland economy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The area that I represent has been coined as the gateway to  the glens. As such, it is ideally placed to catch many of the tourists as they  make their way to the north coast. The entire region of the Antrim coast and  glens attracts many walkers, cyclists and those who enjoy the splendid natural  beauty of the area or the impressive built environment &mdash; none of which is more  impressive than Carrickfergus Castle. It is paramount that funding be made  available to assist the tourism sector in Northern Ireland, specifically in  East Antrim. It is also important that  smaller tourist ventures such as bed and breakfast establishments are  given every chance to promote their business.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Some 865,000 visitors came to Northern Ireland via the port  of Larne in 2006, a considerable number of whom are tourists or work in the  freight industry. I therefore draw attention to the importance of the port of  Larne and to the A8 road, which runs through my constituency. Small-scale  improvements on the A8 have already shortened journey times significantly and  improved road safety. However, investment per mile is still dramatically lower  than the investment per mile on the stretch of road towards the Irish border. I  hope that that disparity can be addressed in the future.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a 10-mile stretch of single carriageway on the A8  that carries a significant amount of rural machinery, which can in turn result  in long tailbacks. There are two negative effects from that. First, drivers  frustrated at hold-ups in traffic often attempt dangerous overtaking  manoeuvres. Secondly, the queues can act as a disincentive for roll-on roll-off  ferry commuters to use the Larne port who feel that it is too slow.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We must recognise that it is not only the economy of East  Antrim and Larne that will suffer unless we recognise the importance of  upgrading the A8, but also the economy of Northern Ireland. A sound transport  network is essential, given that Larne is the favoured route of much freight  from Scotland. We must ensure that that cultural, historical and business route  between Northern Ireland and Scotland is strengthened. My East Antrim colleague  Sammy Wilson has previously spoken to the former Scottish First Minister Jack  McConnell about the issue. That is perhaps an issue that our Executive and the  Scottish Executive could examine further.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am conscious that time is limited and I do not want to restrict the opportunities for other Members  to speak. I could go on to highlight the need for social housing in Newtownabbey and put forward the case for keeping  Inver House in Larne open but those issues have been addressed in the past and will be returned to in the House.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Finance Minister said, many of the issues raised  during the debates of the past two days require imaginative thinking. It is not simply a case of throwing money  at a problem; it is more a case of using the available money wisely.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I congratulate the Minister for the realistic and  responsible attitude that he has adopted to spending in Northern Ireland during  his first weeks in office. I support the Second Stage of the Budget Bill.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: As  I indicated during the consolidation debate, I accept that a new  Administration, which takes office  mid-year, has little choice but to accept the Budget plans of the  previous Administration. However, when examining  the detailed Budget proposals and Estimates, I could not identify any  new money allocated by the Chancellor. When I questioned departmental officials  at the Finance and Personnel Committee, they advised that the Chancellor&rsquo;s  package had not been included in the Budget proposals.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Where are the  additional financial announcements to reveal  how that money will be spent? The DFP officials also advised that  subsequent changes would be incorporated into additional announcements to  allocate the &pound;100 million. It is interesting that the figure of &pound;100 million  was used and not &pound;1 billion. It appears that &pound;100 million has been allocated by  the Chancellor.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In the current financial year, &pound;75 million of that &pound;100  million has been allocated to the deferment of water charges. That leaves  approximately &pound;25 million to be allocated. Interestingly, that concurs with the  views expressed by Nigel Smith in the First Trust Bank&rsquo;s &lsquo;Economic Outlook and  Business Review&rsquo;, when he stated:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Closer scrutiny of the UK Government&rsquo;s &lsquo;peace  dividend&rsquo; package of &pound;1bn shows that it contains &pound;400mn pledged by the Republic  of Ireland (RoI) Government, &pound;200mn of accelerated public asset disposals,  &pound;200mn of end-year flexibility (NI gets to roll over its own spending from one  fiscal year to the next!), some monies to defer the introduction of water  charges (which will be clawed back under the CSR). This leaves just &pound;20mn of  additional resources &mdash; hardly an ample dowry for the new administration.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, according to people who should know, &pound;100  million will be used for the deferment of water charges and the review process  and &pound;20-25 million will be left over.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have closely examined references to the review of public administration (RPA) in the Bill. RPA  expenditure is listed under several  headings: Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure; Department of the Environment;  Department for Regional Development; and  Department for Social Development. There are concerns that costs associated with reorganisation are often  underestimated, meaning that there could be a black hole in the  expenditure plans. It remains to be seen when that difficulty will be faced.  When I questioned the departmental officials, they indicated that unforeseen  RPA costs would be dealt with in end-year monitoring.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">RPA is an opportunity to reduce administrative costs and to  give a greater level of accountability in many areas. It is disappointing that  no significant new money is available to kick-start and front-load the RPA to  get over the initial cost burdens. That would have been a useful area had significant moneys been available  in the Chancellor&rsquo;s package. It  appears that RPA reorganisation is  largely being financed from the block grant allocations.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Finance Minister has indicated, the Budget will be  tight this year. Given that unforeseen RPA costs will be funded by end-year  monitoring, we should expect reduced opportunities at the Supplementary  Estimate stage to allocate moneys that may not have been allocated to other  useful purposes during the year. No pot of gold has been acquired by the incoming Executive, or by the Minister  of Finance and Personnel, who was leading the charge.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It has been mentioned  that the borrowing arrangements have changed. I understand that  borrowing is still maintained at the Bank of England base rate, and, as such,  it does not matter what amount is borrowed, because a similar amount of  interest will have to be paid. I am interested to know what is the great  benefit of changing the borrowing arrangements.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The previous levels of the regional rate were mentioned. It  is important that everyone acknowledge that the highest regional rate in memory  &mdash; certainly in my memory &mdash; occurred in Northern Ireland while the Democratic  Unionist Party was the lead unionist party. The DUP cannot blame the Ulster  Unionist Party for high regional rates that  happened under DUP leadership of the  unionist community, and it must be held to account for that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mention was made that the Budget represented a better  package. It has been omitted that, under the previous Administration, several  valuable properties were transferred to the devolved Administration, including  the Maze site, which is much in vogue at present. The military base at  Ebrington in County Londonderry had substantial land assets transferred to the  responsibility of the Northern Ireland Executive. I am interested to know the  valuation of those sites. It is also interesting to note that the Mahon Road  base in Portadown has been sold to the  private sector. How much of that sale has passed into the hands of the  Northern Ireland Executive? It is important that a balanced view is reached on  those matters.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I shall comment on a few issues relating to my own  constituency. Transport has been a theme that I have revisited on a number of  occasions since joining the Northern Ireland Assembly. As other Members have  said, East Antrim alone retains a third-rate rail service. New trains have been  allocated to other areas of Northern Ireland, but the east Antrim line retains  the old class-450 vehicles and carriages. They have been upgraded and are  better than they were, but they are still a poor second to what is available in  other parts of Northern Ireland. It is important that the rail users of East  Antrim have equality.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a dense urban area along the Larne line, and there  is a huge potential to significantly increase the number of rail users in that  area. There are a large number of stations along that line, and people could  take the opportunity of switching to rail travel, and, therefore, minimise  traffic congestion.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Road bottlenecks, particularly on the A2, should be  removed. That has been highlighted as a priority in the Belfast metropolitan area plan, and should be considered. I  appreciate that that project is still in the planning stage, but I hope that it  will soon be on the starting block for receipt of significant moneys to enable  that blockage to be removed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a four-lane  route on the Jordanstown side of Greenisland, and a four-lane route on  the Carrickfergus side of Greenisland, with  a two-mile stretch of a two-lane road in between, and anyone with common  sense can imagine what happens.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, the A8 from Belfast to Larne, with its  connecting road at Ballynure to the north-west of the Province, is a key  transport link. Plans for the develop&shy;ment of that road have not received the  priority that they should have. I responded to consultation on that issue, and I hope that that key transport link to  Scotland, which carries most of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s exports, will be  prioritised. The congestion that is caused in Larne when ferries offload a  large number of vehicles at one time would be alleviated if an appropriate road  to accommodate them existed. Such a road  would enable the safe and efficient distribution of imports throughout  Northern Ireland and the transport of exports that are bound for the United  Kingdom and Europe.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Indeed, that road is also an important route for tourism. I  hope that the recent Scottish exhibition at the Smithsonian Institution will  result in a significant increase in the number of tourists to Northern Ireland  and to the East Antrim constituency area in particular. Visitors to Northern  Ireland frequently comment on Antrim&rsquo;s coast  road. If a range of facilities were provided, visitors would be  encouraged to come not just for a one-day visit to the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway but for  a visit of several days or a week. They could then enjoy our wonderful  environment and scenery and the hospitality for which we are renowned.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that the Minister will take those comments into  account when he considers the current Budget and future expenditure.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  Members, myself included, will approve the Minister&rsquo;s plans. Several Members  have commented that the Budget is inherited, which, indeed, it is. However, the  public expects Departments and the Executive to be able to respond to future  events, some of which are unforeseen. My remarks, therefore, will be largely  about the Assembly&rsquo;s capacity to use this Budget to respond to certain events.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Private finance initiatives (PFI) for acute hospital  services are under way throughout Northern Ireland in Enniskillen, Omagh,  Antrim, Belfast and Dundonald. As those projects progress, the public is  becoming concerned about peculiar aspects  of them. For example, frozen food will be flown in to be served to  patients in a hospital in Enniskillen. That aspect of that project is complete  nonsense. It is bad for nutrition and health, and it certainly does not make  economic sense. Is the Department aware of any other peculiar aspects of PFI  contracts for acute hospitals? The Assembly needs to know about those  immediately.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Another concern is the so-called affordability gap, meaning  that the figures that have been agreed in a PFI contract to deliver the full  range of hospital services fall short of  current costs. In the Enniskillen and Omagh hospitals projects, it is  envisaged that there will be an affordability gap of &pound;20 million.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members know that the trusts are strapped for cash and that  the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety does not have sufficient  resources; so where will the money come  from? Can money be drawn down from the Department of Finance and  Personnel? If that is not the case then the Health Service is going to become a  complete shambles under its PFI projects.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A couple of points have come up in the course of the  debate. First, there is the reorganisation of councils under the review of  public administration. Decisions taken at Executive level mean that the initial  model envisaged, or at least that which was agreed by Sinn F&eacute;in when the  British Government proposed that Northern Ireland should have seven councils,  is unlikely to happen.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Soon, we will have to carry out further consultation on what the best model should be &mdash; and it will  certainly not be the 26-council model. That work is going to cost more  money. We have already had the Boundary Commission,  and its work may well be set aside. Has the Department of Finance and Personnel made allowances in the  Budget for further work to be done on selecting the model of local government  that will be adopted?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of the Environment is currently in possession of a report, which will be put into  the public domain next week, on whether Northern Ireland will have an  environment protection agency. If we are to have such an agency, it will not be  enough for it to be independent &mdash; it will need to be resourced in a much better  way than the Environment and Heritage Service, the body currently accountable for the care and protection of the  environment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, if Northern Ireland ends up with an independent  environment protection agency, which the vast majority of people would like to  see happen, will we be able to resource it properly?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McQuillan</strong>:  I support the Bill. Finance is a key building block of the Assembly, and  although the accelerated-passage provision is not the best way to deal with business, the DUP fully recognises the  reasons for using it. I welcome the assurance given by the Minister  yesterday that consultation will be materially enhanced in the future. The Programme for Government will be a  vitally important document. It is hoped that the document will have a  priority-driven agenda and not a political  wish list that would have more to do with enhancing the egos of the political parties than delivering real  and effective service for Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister also assure the House that lessons from PFI deals that have been highlighted in PAC  reports will be learned and will be reflected in the Workplace 2010  contracts soon to be awarded?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  support the Bill.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I was glad to hear the Member for Strangford Mr McNarry who  spoke earlier but who is not in the Chamber. I congratulate him because when he  spoke on a previous occasion &mdash; on the issue of fisheries &mdash; his speech borrowed  heavily from the Member of Parliament for Strangford. Today, one assumes that  Mr McNarry&rsquo;s speech was his own work, for I  am sure that no one else would own  up and take responsibility for it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McNarry seemed to get very enthused with &lsquo;Star Trek&rsquo; analogies. In case there is any doubt on  the subject, I should point out that &lsquo;Star Trek&rsquo;, like the content of Mr McNarry&rsquo;s speech, is a work of fiction. Mr  McNarry accused those of us on these Benches as being like the crew in  &lsquo;Star Trek&rsquo;, but I suspect that those on the Benches alongside him would be  more appropriately likened to the crew of the Titanic, sinking below the waves,  or perhaps to the Mary Celeste, the ghost ship that was deserted and left  lurching from side to side.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McNarry today presented Members with a great deal of  rhetoric. He was critical of the Budget Bill, and of the efforts of the DUP in  negotiations with the Government. All parties, including the UUP and Mr McNarry&rsquo;s party colleagues in the Executive,  supported yesterday&rsquo;s appropriation motion. Therefore, I am keen to see  whether the Member for Strangford will put his money where his mouth is. If he  has such strongly held objections to the Budget Bill, will he vote against it?  We will take that as the acid test.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As to the complaints of Mr McNarry and Mr Beggs &mdash; a Member  for East Antrim &mdash; that no new money is allocated in the Budget, it was made  clear yesterday that it reflects what was available after direct rule. My hon  colleague, the Minister of Finance and Personnel, will refer to changes that  have arisen out of the recent negotiations with the Chancellor of the  Exchequer. It would have been impractical to  include those in the Bill. Mr McNarry and others are keen for those  adjustments to be made to the Bill; perhaps they will tell us what front-line  services they will starve of funds during the consequent delay. The Department  of Finance and Personnel would require additional time to incorporate those  changes into the Bill.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  asked when we might expect the announcement of additional money. I am content  that this was the Budget as determined by  the previous direct rule Administration. I simply ask how the additional  money will be spent.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  commend the Member for remaining in the House after his speech, unlike his  colleague the Member for Strangford. If the Member is sufficiently patient to  wait until the end of the debate, he will hear the detail of some of the  changes.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We must move away from instant fix solutions. Some of the  changes to be announced will help the economy and assist in controlling public  spending in the long run. <em>[Interruption.]</em></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Those details will be referred to in the Minister&rsquo;s speech;  you will not have to wait long. However, I appreciate that waiting for that may  be beyond the patience of some Members.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am glad that most of the Members&rsquo; contributions yesterday  and today have been responsible and constructive.  The Committee for Finance and Personnel, of which I am a member,  accepted accelerated passage for the Budget  Bill; and it is important that those resources are delivered to the  front line as soon as possible.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We require increased appreciation of financial realities. Irrespective of how generous or tight  a Budget is, there will never be enough money to satisfy every potential  desire. Sooner or later, whatever the financial circumstances &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Does the Member accept that the general public expects a substantial peace  dividend, and that it is as yet unclear to what extent that has been achieved?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: The  UUP berated my party, saying that it had not produced a pot of gold. Since that  party did not even produce a pot, I take no lectures from it. Also, the UUP ran  on the manifesto commitment that, no matter what happened in negotiations with  the Chancellor of the Exchequer, it would be in there from day one: so neither  do I accept its lessons in negotiating strategy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Sooner or later, and this will be uncomfortable for many  Members, we will face the challenge of deciding between spending priorities. Any Member who believes otherwise is fooling himself. As indicated  yesterday and today, the key  challenge in rebalancing the economy is to create circumstances in which  we can boost the private sector. I welcome a debate on whether that is more  important than reducing the size of the public sector. As a society we are keen to obtain our rights, but we must also accept that there are certain financial  responsibilities and realities.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">2.30 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Budget Bill poses  challenges to the Departments and  opportunities that must be examined. The Department of Education must  look closely at the unfair treatment that was meted out to centres of education  in the South Eastern Education and Library Board (SEELB) area due to the  financial constraints that were placed upon the board. The high level of  special needs statementing of young people  in the South Eastern Board area, which was  clinically driven, required levels of expenditure that outstripped those of the other board areas, but  the South Eastern Board was not recompensed to the same level.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As a result, draconian cuts were forced on the South Eastern Board by the direct rule Minister with  responsi&shy;bility for education. I am glad to say that all parties were  united in opposition to those cuts. However, that situation ultimately led to  the imposition of commis&shy;sioners. Situations such as that must be addressed,  and we must examine the disparity of funding between the South Eastern Board  area and its Belfast counterpart. Falling demographics mean that pupils who  live in the South Eastern Board area, but  attend schools in Belfast, create a  net loss in the South Eastern Board area, which has to pick up the tab  for transport. Meanwhile, the Belfast Board receives funding for the places  taken up by pupils travelling to schools from the South Eastern Board area. The Department of Education must examine  that situation and also the extent to which primary schools in Northern Ireland suffer a disparity in funding compared  to other sectors.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although that scenario is particularly true of the  Department of Education, it applies equally to other Government Departments. We  must ensure that capital funding is spent swiftly and appropriately. At times,  that has been sadly lacking and has perhaps been a token of the disregard shown  by direct rule Ministers. At times, in large capital projects, particularly in  the education sector, the expectation of swift action is built up, only for  schools to be left hanging for years, waiting for action to be taken.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I note, for example, the effect on schools in my  constituency: the proposed move of Priory Integrated College seems to have been  held back on numerous occasions, and that has had a knock-on effect on the  proposed merger of Holywood Primary School and Redburn Primary School. It is  important, therefore, that when capital expenditure commitments are made by the  Department of Education &mdash;at times it has been the worst example &mdash; the money is  actually spent.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">When the time comes to re-examine the Budget we must give  greater priority to waste management, which is of great concern to my hon  Friend the Minister of the Environment, Mrs Foster. Waste management has been  underfunded for years, which does not help the Northern Ireland economy in the  long run. Unless swift action on waste management is taken in the next few  years, it will not simply be a question of the opportunity missed: if we do not  get this right, the Province will face potentially large fines from Europe.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Several Members made points about transport infrastructure and funding for the road networks  and the railways. If the Department for Regional Development is  providing that funding &mdash; and commitments were made  to deliver it &mdash; we must ensure that those moneys are well spent. The  Public Accounts Committee highlighted the  problems associated with the investment in the Belfast to Bangor railway  line, which led to the squandering of a great deal of money.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Those are some of the challenges that we face.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Budget because, given the available  timescales, it is the appropriate way forward. In the months and years ahead,  the great challenge for the Executive and the Assembly will be to ensure that  we use the budgetary process to add value to this society. I look forward to  the Minister&rsquo;s response and to further action&rsquo;s being taken. I support the  motion.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>:  During yesterday&rsquo;s lengthy debate on resource  allocation, I outlined my views on the economy and on the way forward.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Many Members have said, and it is a matter of record, that  this Budget was prepared by the direct rule Administration and is already in  operation. Therefore it would be pointless, at this stage, to discuss wish  lists or pet subjects. However, many Members  have indulged in speeches of that nature. Wish lists and pet subjects are really matters for discussion in the autumn  when we will prepare the Budget for 2008-09. That Budget will fall within the comprehensive spending review and  will be the real test for the Executive and the Assembly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Yesterday, I ended my contribution by emphasising the  importance of having adequate resources to meet the challenges in Northern  Ireland. That remains the main issue that is yet to be resolved between the  Assembly and HM Treasury.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am happy and satisfied that we approve the Budget Bill.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  The debate has been useful, and, for the most part, Members have taken it  seriously and have made valuable  contributions. There have, however, been exceptions, with which I will  deal in some detail. First, however, I should deal with the more informed and  intelligent comments, and &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  It will be a short speech, in that case. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>: I agree entirely with the Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel that the legal  necessity to pass the Bill is one of the encouraging factors for us to accept  it as the route forward. Unless we pass the Bill, we will run out of money in  early July. Clearly, that would have  devastating consequences. However, some people who lectured us about  taking on the direct rule Budget do not seem to understand those consequences.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Loan referred to  the importance of representation for citizens and consumers. In  particular, he mentioned the Utility  Regulator and the General Consumer Council. I am happy to join with Mr  O&rsquo;Loan in his warm appreciation of their contributions. They provide a valuable service and perform a positive role in  our society.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, I must point out that, contrary to Mr O&rsquo;Loan&rsquo;s  comments, and given that we are the representatives of citizens and consumers  in Northern Ireland, it can hardly be said that they are under-represented. In  fact, compared to those in any other part of the United Kingdom, perhaps  citizens and consumers here are over-represented, particularly in this Chamber. However, where there is a  requirement for a regulator, a voice, or a commissioner for a particular  sector, we must consider each case on its own merits. My colleagues and I  supported the case for a children&rsquo;s commissioner; we have argued for a  commissioner for older people; and we argued &mdash; and got &mdash; a commiss&shy;ioner for  victims. Therefore I accept very much Mr O&rsquo;Loan&rsquo;s argument. It is important  that someone who can focus on particular issues and help our consumers and  citizens be appointed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Dr Farry raised several issues. He said that the Budget is  flawed. As this is not my Budget, I am, perhaps, in the strange position where,  in moving it, I can, to some extent, agree with him. However, I must fulfil the  requirement to proceed with the Budget of the direct rule Ministers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Dr Farry mentioned the significant subvention that Northern Ireland receives, but, as I said  yesterday, we are an integral part of the United Kingdom and we are entitled  to enjoy its prosperity. We have an expenditure of more than &pound;17 billion,  comprising a resource departmental expenditure limit of approximately &pound;8&middot;5  billion, an annually managed expenditure of slightly more than &pound;7 billion, and  a capital departmental expenditure limit of almost &pound;1&middot;5 billion. That is a  significant budget for the Province, and, as I said yesterday, there are  several ways of building on that &mdash; if that is what we want to do.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have already mentioned my meetings with the European  Commissioner, the ongoing process with the Chancellor, the discussions with Sir  David Varney, and the need to look at the regional rate. However, I agree with  Dr Farry that if one is requesting more money from the Treasury, that request  is more convincing if one can show that one is dealing with issues of reform in  the public service and looking to new thinking. That will show that one is  serious, and it will make a favourable response more likely. We must  demonstrate that type of seriousness in facing the challenges ahead.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Dr Farry also mentioned corporation tax. I will not go into  that in too much detail at this stage, but suffice it to say that in our  meeting with President Barroso, he <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">argued  that it would be up to the European Com</span>mission to decide what to do, but  that a case for special circumstances for Northern Ireland had not been  presented to it by the United Kingdom Government. There are associated legal  complications, but in our discussions with those who show some expertise in <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">those matters, the complications are not  insurmountab</span>le, if the political will exists. We will wait for the  outcome of the Varney review before addressing corporation tax in any detail,  but it is an important issue with which the Executive must deal.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member for North Down Dr Farry also mentioned roads  funding. The Roads Service has been allocated almost &pound;200 million to deliver on  its regional transportation strategy, but I will return to the transportation  strategy later. The Roads Service has been given a considerable amount of  money, and a proper planning process is required to ensure that that is spent  wisely. One must remember that we can pick out any figure for capital spend  from the air, but it must be integrated with the ability of the construction industry to construct within the same period.  Therefore, there is a need for consultation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member for Strangford Mr Simon Hamilton mentioned the  European package. I met President Barroso, along with the First Minister, the  Deputy First Minister and the Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment. I was impressed by President Barroso&rsquo;s enthusiasm to  assist Northern Ireland.  He said that he wanted to set up a task force to look at the issues relating to  Northern Ireland.  He wants to look at such things as how best Northern   Ireland will compete for European funds since it has lost  its Objective 1 status, <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">and he wishes to  explore how expertise might be brought</span> in  from elsewhere in Europe to help us achieve  funding. <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">He also expressed  willingness for a study on the Norther<span style="letter-spacing:0pt; ">n Ireland</span> economy to be undertaken. He has asked his  colleague, Commissioner Danuta H&uuml;bner, to take forward that project, and we are  discussing with him how best to conduct a study that will not simply  duplicat</span>e the many studies that have  gone before on the Northern Ireland economy. We want the new study to  have some added value, and the Commissioner agrees that that is the best way  forward.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, there is benefit in further engagement with the  European Union. The First Minister and the Deputy First Minister intend to  visit Europe in the near future, and hopefully  there will be further discussions between officials from the Department of  Finance and Personnel and those involved in the task force that is to be set up  by President Barroso.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member for Upper Bann Mr O&rsquo;Dowd raised a number of points; it is unfortunate that he is  not present to hear my response. He indicated that, although he was  supporting the Budget this year, he would not be reluctant to attack next  year&rsquo;s Budget. The Member should be aware &mdash; so that he gets that notion out of  his head &mdash; that next year&rsquo;s Budget will not be the Department of Finance and  Personnel&rsquo;s Budget; it will not be Peter Robinson&rsquo;s Budget; it will, however, be  an Executive Budget, as it will have to be agreed by the Executive. I am sure  that he will want to give faithful support to his colleagues on the Executive,  rather than attacking their Budget and the Budget of the other Ministers in the  Executive.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I was concerned to hear Mr O&rsquo;Dowd refer to the opening up  of the Barnett formula. That issue has been dangled in front of Finance  Ministers and discussed in Finance Committees and in a wide variety of forums.  There are considerable dangers involved, and I am nervous about that prospect. If it were the responsibility of  the Assembly to evaluate the formula, then by all means, we could consider it.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, there  will be competing interests when the time comes to reconsider the  Barnett formula. I fear that the political interests of a new Prime Minister,  with his mind on an election, might skew the Barnett formula in a way that  would not be favourable to Northern    Ireland. Therefore, on some issues, we might  from time to time look for Barnett-plus. We will certainly be requiring Barnett  consequentials when a Chancellor gives a particular emphasis to an area of  expenditure. It is important to consider long and hard before we encourage the  Chancellor or the Treasury to open up the Barnett formula.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Dowd also mentioned the subject of the dispersal of  public sector jobs. However, as that matter will be debated this afternoon, I  am prepared to hold fire on that issue until then.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">He referred to the review of public administration and  asked if I had deliberately left it out of the list of savings that I mentioned  yesterday as a means of reducing bureaucracy. Had I thought of the issue  yesterday; I would not have been reluctant to mention it. It is necessary to  reduce from 26 the number of councils in Northern Ireland. There are  political issues that will determine what number is settled on, as there is a  balance to be gained between the economies involved and having a local  Government. The larger the areas are, the less local they become, so there is a  need to balance that equation. However, Mr O&rsquo;Dowd rightly stated that the more  councils that exist, the less savings will be made &mdash; that is obvious.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On the other side of the equation, there are areas of  activity, which are presently based on a unitary system, that are considered  suitable for transfer to the councils. If those areas were transferred to even  seven councils, they would cost more, yet I did not hear the Member suggest  that we should not give responsibility to local government for roads, planning and  so forth. Perhaps a balance can be struck on the number of additional councils  that should exist in Northern    Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps the councils  should not be given responsibility for roads. I am sure that by now, the  Member will have heard from his colleague the Minister for Regional Development  that there are considerable advantages in having the Roads Service continue in  its present form &mdash; a unitary roads authority. At various places around the  world, I have been commended by people on the set-up in Northern Ireland  and told how they envied it. Now we have proposals, albeit from direct rule  Ministers, that indicate that we should ruin a system that is the envy of the  rest of the world.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If there are seven, 11 or 15, that will add very  considerably to the cost of road functions and will lead to a considerable rise  in the rates, particularly west of the Bann. Members need to draw that to the  attention of their constituents.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Dowd also made some comments about procurement. I agree that the primary focus must remain  on efficient, effective purchasing. I am Chairman of the Procurement Board,  where all of the elements of the Civil Service, including the permanent  secretaries, meet. It shows that real, considerable savings are being made by  our procurement policies. We have not yet reached  Utopia, but considerable progress has been made.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague Mr Alastair Ross from East   Antrim &mdash; not unexpectedly &mdash; raised the matter of trains and, in  particular, the Larne line. I have reasonably clean hands, given that I signed  the cheque for 28 new trains when I was Minister for Regional Development. He  cannot blame me if they were dispersed in a way that did not suit. However, the  one lesson that I did learn in the Department for Regional Development (DRD) is  that if we want to take people off the roads and onto public transport &mdash; and,  given the massive congestion on our roads and its expected increase, that  should be our aim &mdash; we must have a  public-transport system that is attractive to consumers. It was for that  reason that the Regional Transportation Plan set out a programme that included  an upgrading of both railway lines and buses. It is essential that we have a  public-transport system that can be relied upon, one that is dependable,  comfortable and that comes at an acceptable cost.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member for East Antrim also told us of the tourist  delights in his constituency and of Larne port&rsquo;s great advantage as the gateway  to Northern Ireland.  This is very important to both business and tourism. The port of Larne  has an important role to play in DRD. I approved some schemes to improve the  A8. I believe that there are other proposals, but I will draw those matters to  the attention of the present Minister for Regional Development, who will, in  time, bring forward his own proposals.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Tommy Gallagher referred to PFI. I do not find myself  ideologically wedded to PFI. I am, however, wedded to value for money, and any  scheme must be tested for affordability and value for money, as well as by how  it delivers. The Executive and the scrutiny Committees will want to examine  those matters. However, just as I do not take an ideological position in favour  of it, neither do I do take one against it. We need to look at whatever  instruments are available, and see how best they can be used to the advantage  of the community that we all represent.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Tommy Gallagher also  referred to the RPA, and made some comments on its funding. That is  interesting, and I should like to remind people of something that seems to have  been forgotten: the genesis of the RPA was an Ulster  Unionist Party conference, where the then Minister Mr Sam Foster argued  that it would bring us savings. Yet it is very clear that, in several areas, it  will not bring us savings and that, in the areas where savings can be made,  those will not be made in the short term.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Clearly the Executive will also have to look at the rolling  out of the RPA programme in relation to budgetary issues.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As far as the environmental protection agency is concerned,  Mr Gallagher is aware that the decision to remove it from the Budget was made  by the direct rule ministers. The Minister of the Environment is looking into  this, and if she is to bring forward a proposal recommending an environmental  protection agency or any derivation of that she will also bring forward proposals  for the accompanying funding.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Peter Weir, a Member for North Down, referred to capital  funding issues and particularly the gap that occurs between an announcement  being made and construction actually taking place. The European tendency is to  announce things repeatedly, but that builds an expectation, and years pass  without anything happening. We need to look at the lead-in times for a number  of capital projects.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As a former Minister for Regional Development, we  recognised that there was a very long lead-in time, and the Member for East  Londonderry, who was also a Minister for Regional Development, will know that  it often takes much longer than two years from the decision to proceed with a  road to the point at which it can begin. We built up a roads pool and started  to prioritise issues so that as soon as the money was available, most of the  statutory work had been completed, and we could continue to the tendering  process and complete the job without having to wait for the legalities to be  finalised. Other Departments should follow this example and start looking at  the lead-in times to ensure that we can deliver.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will return to the Chancellor&rsquo;s package in more detail in a moment. The Chancellor repeatedly  questioned us on our ability to spend the money. He was not convinced,  presumably on the basis of the direct rule Ministers who had preceded us, that  we were capable of spending the over &pound;1 billion to &pound;2 billion in a year. We did  our utmost to convince him of our ability to spend money wisely, but we will  look at that in more detail shortly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member for North Down also referred to the regional  transportation plan. I suggest that the Minister for Regional Development lodge  a progress report on the regional transportation plan so that he is not blamed  for the dragging of feet in the period up until devolution commenced again. The  plan was laid out and approved unanimously by the Assembly; it had a programme  linked to spend, a programme that would have considerably improved our roads  and public transportation system. The plan is still sound, although from time  to time I am sure that the Regional Development Minister and the Regional  Development Committee will wish to examine aspects of it. A progress report  would be useful to see how much off course we have gone over the period of  direct rule.</p>
	      <p class="B3SpeakerinChair" style="margin-top:6.4pt;margin-right:11.35pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;margin-left:11.35pt;">(Mr Deputy Speaker  [Mr Dallat] in the Chair)</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member for Strangford Mr David McNarry demonstrated in  this afternoon&rsquo;s contribution why it would be better if we did not allow him to  speak on financial matters. He demonstrated at great length a painfully shallow  appreciation of the budgetary issues we face and revealed his own ignorance for  all to see.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Before he spoke, many of us suspected how little of the  subject he understood; after he sat down, we knew how little he did. Perhaps it  is not surprising given his own background and experience in business, and with  a track record like his, I doubt that anyone would wish to entrust him with a  credit card, let alone the public finances.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mind you, Mr McNarry&rsquo;s political record is no better than  his economic one &mdash; he has helped to transform Strangford, previously one of the  Ulster Unionist Party&rsquo;s strongest constituencies, into one that is reduced to a  solitary seat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Is that your best defence?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Peter Robinson</strong>:  He was elected on the tenth count. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> </p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I hear a sedentary intervention from &ldquo;tenth-count&rdquo; McNarry. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> He might be better to find out why the  electorate continues to reject the Ulster Unionist Party. If he would wait  until I have finished dealing with the issues, instead of interrupting, he  would find out exactly what the answers are to the issues that he raised.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Go to the people of East Belfast and see what  their response is.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I have been to the electorate of East Belfast  22 times, and on each occasion I have been elected. I am also delighted to say  that, in the same period when support for the Ulster Unionist Party in  Strangford has fallen, the Democratic Unionist Party has become the largest party  and has returned four Assembly Members and  the Member of Parliament for that constituency. Before making  unsubstantiated comments, Mr McNarry would do well to compare the record of the Ulster Unionist Party with that of  the DUP.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>: The DUP&rsquo;s record is on trial, not ours.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. It would be in the interest of all Assembly Members if we  could confine the debate to the subject under discussion, and leave the party  politics for elsewhere.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I am absolutely sure that you are right, Mr Deputy Speaker; it is unfortunate  that you were not in the Chair during Mr McNarry&rsquo;s speech. I think that, in  winding up the debate, I am entitled to respond to the issues that Mr McNarry  raised during it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The record of the Ulster Unionist Party is that it allowed Sinn F&eacute;in into an Executive without  decommiss&shy;ioning and while that organisation continued with paramilitary  and criminal activity, gave no support to the police, did not recognise our courts  and would not accept the rule of law. That is the record of the Ulster Unionist  Party. On all those issues, the Democratic Unionist  Party was able to reverse the bad record of the Ulster Unionist Party  and do a good deal for unionism. More than that, we transformed this Assembly  from being one in which there was no accountability &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Even the Minister must address his  remarks through the Chair.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  The Assembly previously had no accountability, either for the decisions of  Ministers or on North/South issues. The decisions taken by the Democratic  Unionist Party negotiators have ensured that there is accountability and  collectivity in the Executive. That is distinctly  to the advantage not just of the people of Northern Ireland but of democracy  itself.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Ulster Unionist Party Members have some cheek to talk to  anyone about their ability to negotiate. Mr McNarry  made some retorts about the financial package, so let us consider the  financial package issues &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  It was a deal-breaker.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  Is there a Speaker in the House?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Mrs Foster has asked a good question, which I now put to the  people who are causing the disturbance and ignoring the Speaker.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  The one thing that the Member did do accurately was to quote our position that,  if there were a zero financial package, there would be no deal. His lack of  knowledge about the financial package &mdash; and, indeed, of finances in general &mdash;  is what leads him to the view that there is a zero package. Nobody believes  that it is a zero package, except the dull heads in the Ulster Unionist Party.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Tell us about the deal.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I will tell the Assembly about the financial  package. First, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has agreed to increase  our capital spend allocation by &pound;2 billion. We have an extra &pound;100 million in  our annual resource budget for this year, with further increases in the  following three years guaranteed. Revenue from asset sales can now be retained for spending in Northern Ireland,  rather than being reclaimed by the Treasury, as was the case for certain large  projects in the past. We have guarantees on the use of end-of-year flexibility  on both the resource and the capital side. A review of tax policy in Northern Ireland  is being carried out by Sir David Varney.  Instead of attempting to undermine that review, it would be better if  the Ulster Unionist Party &mdash; an Executive party &mdash; would attempt to convince Sir  David to make some helpful recommendations. We have also been guaranteed an  investment conference for Northern    Ireland, which has received support from,  and will be led by, the Chancellor, who will be the new Prime Minister.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We have also managed to retrieve something from the  disastrous consequences of the 2002 reinvestment and reform initiative (RRI)  negotiations, for which the Ulster Unionist Party was responsible. The Member  for East Antrim Mr Beggs had the audacity to suggest that the 19% rise in rates  was somehow the fault of the Democratic Unionist Party because it was the  largest unionist party at the time. The only  reason why the rates rose by 19% was that, under the poor deal  negotiated by the Ulster Unionist Party, there was a requirement that there be  a reduction in the difference between the amount of tax raised locally in Northern Ireland and that raised in Great Britain.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In order to have access to the reinvestment and reform  initiative, it was necessary to reduce the gap between Northern Ireland  taxation and that on the mainland. The Democratic Unionist Party successfully  renegotiated the bad Ulster Unionist Party deal, and that link has been broken.  In the past &mdash; <em>[Interruption.]</em></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Mrs Foster, you complained recently.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  Yes I did.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: You are now one of the problems.  Please address your remarks through the Chair.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  As my colleague Mr Peter Weir indicated, in the past, the Democratic Unionist  Party has been critical of Mr McNarry, who was involved in plagiarism. All Members will be aware of the fact  that &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  You get your lawyers ready for this one, Peter. Your remarks will be in  Hansard. You just keep going.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I will continue, and I will do so in the clearest possible terms. Indeed, can I  challenge the Member to take any legal action that he wants? If he does not  take legal action &mdash; sit down there &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order, order.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We cannot have two Members speaking at the same time.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  Especially one with high blood pressure.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: We now have three people speaking at the same time. Please allow  the Minister to continue.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  The charge of plagiarism is easy to prove: the Member copied the Member of  Parliament for Strangford&rsquo;s speech, which  was made at Westminster,  and read it in the Assembly, almost word for word. He copied the speech to such  an extent that although he delivered it after new statistics had been  published, he used the statistics that the Member of Parliament for Strangford  had used at Westminster, which were out of date by the time of the Assembly  speech. That is how bad a plagiarist he is.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  When has the Member of Parliament for Strangford ever written a speech, never  mind given me one to copy?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I cannot hear what the Member is shouting at me.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind Members that it is raining outside. I am sure that they  do not want to go there. Please allow the Minister to continue.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  The claim has been made clearly, and it is on the record. The challenge has  been issued, and we will all await the legal case that the Member does not  bring. He will, of course, skulk off and hope that Members will forget all  about it. I shall place the two speeches in the Library so that everybody can  read them and be the judges of the Member for Strangford&rsquo;s plagiarism.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. What has this got to do with the Budget  Bill?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Answer!</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I will answer the Member for Strangford.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  You are rabble. Sit down!</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  The Member asked for an answer, and then he asked me to sit down. Clearly, he  does not want the answer. I made the remarks; the Deputy Speaker did not make  the remarks.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>: You speak through the Speaker in here.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order, order.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I invite the Minister to return to the subject under  debate. I am sure that the public would want to hear about the Budget Bill.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  My comment is relevant. Although the DUP has  been critical of the Member for Strangford&rsquo;s plagiarism, it would have  been much better if he had plagiarised DUP speeches, rather than coming out  with the tripe that he spoke during the debate earlier today. Rather than my  criticising him, he would be better off copying the speeches of his colleague  the Member of Parliament for Strangford.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member for Strangford also had the audacity to  criticise me for introducing a direct rule Budget. His colleagues in the Executive  supported the process in which we are now  engaged. His colleagues &mdash; the leader of  his party and the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  &mdash; supported this Budget as the way forward.  His Assembly colleagues voted for it yesterday. Indeed, he voted for it  yesterday &mdash; he did not say a word in opposition. Therefore, what he criticises  today, he voted for yesterday &mdash; such is the consistency of the Member for  Strangford. If Mr McNarry had even the slightest  understanding of the Budget process, he would know why it was not  possible to make significant adjustments during the year. This is the month of  June, Mr McNarry; the financial year begins in April.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: I have an important announce&shy;ment to  make. There has been severe flooding on the roof of the Building due to the  heavy rainfall. There is <span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt; ">some leakage onto  the fourth and third floors &mdash; obviously</span> a storm of a different type.  This may have an impact on the fire alarms. There are two-minute delays built  into the fire alarm system. If a fire alarm is triggered, I will not ask  Members to leave. I am sorry for that interruption; I thought that the House  should hear about that.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>: On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Is it your advice that  we stay, in order to get less wet than if we go outside, where we will get  really wet?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Go ahead, Minister.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>: It is abundantly clear that the course that has been adopted and recommended to this House by all the  members of the Executive, including the Ulster Unionist members, is a pragmatic  and sensible way forward. I thank the Members who genuinely wanted to be  constructive in this debate for their contributions. In spite of the efforts of the Ulster Unionist Party, it has been a good debate, and we have discussed many  issues of real importance to the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The restoration of the Assembly has presented us with an  opportunity to deliver a better future for the people of Northern Ireland  and to improve public services for the benefit of everyone. This approach  brings challenges, and the Executive will have many difficult decisions to  make. However, the programme that we adopt will enable us in future years to  take forward a strategy to strengthen the local economy; encourage investment  by making Government more responsible and agile; improve and enhance our  infrastructure; tackle poverty and deprivation; and upgrade the core front-line  services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Devolution is only of value if we use it to improve the  lives of our people, especially those in greatest need. Devolution will be seen  to have worked when we grow our economy and bring greater prosperity to Northern Ireland  and its people. This Government intends to  make a difference and deliver improvements.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In commending this Bill to the Assembly, I rejoice that it  is Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  elected representatives who are making these decisions in a devolved Assembly.  Let us take, and make the most of, this opportunity.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Before we proceed to the Question, I remind Members that this is a  Budget Bill and that, therefore, the motion  requires cross-community support.</p>

	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30  minutes for this debate. The proposer of the  motion will have 10 minutes to  propose and 10 minutes to wind up; all other Members who wish to speak  will have five minutes. Two amendments have been received and are published on  the Marshalled List. The Member who proposed the motion has also tabled one of  those amendments.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: I  beg to move</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls on  the Minister of Finance and Personnel to honour the resolution made by the  &lsquo;Hain&rsquo; Assembly, on 6 June 2006, to cap industrial rates at 25 per cent.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I beg to move amendment No 2: At end insert</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">&lsquo;; and for the Minister of  Finance and Personnel to make a statement  to the Assembly, following publication of the ERINI report.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Last summer, the House debated industrial rating. The  Member for East Londonderry, who is now in the Chair, proposed the motion that  industrial rates should be capped at 25%, which was agreed by all Members. We  need to move on and deliver that which we agreed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Northern Ireland Manufacturing Focus Group (NIMFG) has  made, and continues to make, cogent arguments for this assistance to what is  left of the manufacturing base. Today&rsquo;s economic climate is very different to  that of even five or six years ago. Manufacturing jobs have been reduced to a  fraction of what they once were. Industry is competing in a global environment  against very low labour and material costs. Our near neighbour, the Republic of Ireland, has a much more beneficial tax  regime. This is the only part of the United Kingdom that has a land  border with a country that operates a different fiscal regime and is within the  euro zone.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The decision to phase out industrial derating is seriously  flawed. Instead, we must develop a wealth-creating economy that retains as much  of its manufact&shy;uring base as possible. Indeed, we need to add to that  manufacturing base.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the past, we were  often reminded that the economy relied too heavily on the public sector.  The increasing application of industrial rates will do nothing to change that  balance; it will have the opposite effect. Increasing rates will threaten the  profitability and viability of businesses. Several thousand jobs will be put at  risk, and we must not allow that to happen.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When Mr Pearson was in office, he promised to assist the  industry by reducing the higher electricity costs. Those higher electricity  costs remain. Although some &pound;30 million was set aside to deal with them, the  plan was turned down by our European friends. The financial aid has not been made available to the industry.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When DTZ Pieda Consulting presented its report to the  Government at that time, it forecasted that the impact from full industrial  rates would be only 2&middot;7% of profits. Invest Northern Ireland (INI) and others  have produced revised figures that are considerably higher.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Rates may represent only a small proportion of business turnover, but they represent a higher  proportion of profits. Companies that experience low profits can have  their viability altered dramatically by a change in overhead costs, which can  lead to closure. It makes sense to assist such businesses to stay in business  and create employment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Manufacturing represents a small percentage of the economy  for gross domestic product (GDP) and employment &mdash; it may be as low as 15% &mdash; but  it generates the vast majority of our exports. We are told that 90,000 people  are employed in manufacturing and we could  lose one third of those jobs. We cannot take that risk. Jobs will also  be put at risk in service industries.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We could rehearse many more arguments, but I trust that the  House will again unite in opposing the implementation of industrial rates  beyond the 25% level. I agree fully with the First Minister, who, in the debate  on 6 June 2006, said that we must:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;ensure that  industrial rate liability is kept at 25%.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official Report, Bound  Volume 19, p62, col 2].</span></span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">We ought to keep our promises.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  beg to move amendment No 1: Leave out all after &ldquo;calls&rdquo; and insert</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;upon the Executive to  consider the resolution made by the &lsquo;Hain&rsquo; Assembly on 6 June 2006, concerning  industrial rates, in light of the impact of rating on manufacturing in Northern  Ireland and in the context of other  priorities in the Comprehensive Spending Review, having considered the  independent assessment presently being carried out into the matter by the  Economic Research Institute of Northern Ireland (ERINI).&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Despite the attempts by  the Member for Strangford Mr McNarry  to have the Assembly in orbit, considering what is beyond the stars, it  is more important that Members keep their feet on the ground and face certain  realities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I hoped that the fact that the Assembly has got down to  what could be described as &ldquo;real business&rdquo; would ensure that Members have  learned the lessons from the previous Private Members Business in the House.  Hopefully, Members will have realised the need to consider the issues in a  mature manner and to work within the reality of fiscal constraints that simply  cannot be wished away. I welcome the comments made by the Minister for Social Development this morning about financial  realities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Industrial derating has been debated several times in the  House. The views of Members and parties have been voiced on many occasions, both inside and outside the  Chamber.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My amendment refers to the debate that took place on 6 June  2006 &mdash; the proposer of the motion has also referred to it. The case was well  put on that occasion. The economy of Northern Ireland is a key issue for  us all, and the drive to improve our private sector is an aim that everyone  shares. Businesspeople in Northern    Ireland realise that a return to zero rating  is unlikely; they recognise and support the principle of ensuring that they  make their contribution.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that we look at the impact of rating on manufacturing businesses across Northern  Ireland so that we can decide on the most suitable and sustainable  level. The service sector is increasing in size, so it is important for us to ensure that our manufacturing  sector is maintained and enhanced.  Manufacturing accounts for the vast  majority of our exports. Although manufacturing has endured some  difficult times, it is important &mdash; indeed,  vital &mdash; to ensure that manufacturing businesses in this part of the United Kingdom  have a future.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore it is important that industrial rating should  receive the full benefit of the independent assessment being carried out by the  Economic Research Institute of Northern Ireland (ERINI). When that assessment  has been made, it will be prudent for the Assembly and the Executive to make  full use of all the available information, so that an informed, correct  decision can be made.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is also important that the issue be looked at alongside  the full range of priorities that the Executive have identified. It has been  said in the House recently that, if every issue were made the number one  priority, nothing would receive attention. That would do an injustice to the  many other issues that we consider. It is essential that we choose the correct  economic policies in order to ensure economic stability and progress.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is incumbent on us as a party to ensure that the economy  is and will be a priority for us. Despite the assertions of the Member for  Strangford Mr McNarry earlier, we have given  that commitment. I have no doubt that the Minister, as he has already  adequately shown, is more than capable of producing the circumstances,  principles and policies that will deliver that economic stability.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that Members will support my amendment. To do so  would show our support for manufacturing businesses in Northern Ireland, and it  would also send to the Executive the desired message: that they should consider  the views that have been put forward in the House today and in the past, and  ensure that the most comprehensive information is available to them so that not  only the most informed, but the most appropriate and suitable, decisions can be made. I hope that Members will  share the aim of the amendment and join us in supporting it.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.  I thank Mr Beggs and Mr Cree for tabling a motion on an important matter  that must be addressed. I am aware that my  party colleagues Mitchel McLaughlin and  Alex Maskey met the Northern Ireland Manufacturing Focus Group (NIMFG)  on a number of occasions in order to discuss the issue and bring it to the  fore. I congratulate the NIMFG on keeping  the issue of industrial rating high on the agenda.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The sentiment of the motion is good, but, in my view, it  has been brought before the Assembly too soon. ERINI&rsquo;s review of industrial  derating is ongoing; it has not yet reported, and we need to wait for the  completion of the report to see what it advises. There is a need to recognise  that business rating is only one aspect of a much wider problem that requires  general reforms, including democratic control of fiscal policy and the  development of an all-Ireland taxation and rating system.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Following the review of public administration, it is  important that the new functions for councils should include a system of  local-government accountability for the spending of commercial rates as there  currently is in the Twenty-six Counties.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The capacity of local councils to deliver business  development, secure and develop new jobs through enterprise units is weak.  Therefore, it is vital that business rates are  ring-fenced for economic development, allowing new and existing  businesses to move forward and grow stronger with an even greater support mechanism to assist their development and enable  them to be the industrial leaders of the future.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The sentiment of the motion is good, but Members must  explore all of the options, both now and in the future. I represent West Belfast.  Government Departments have deliberately neglected my constituency and  other socially deprived areas. When attempting to secure industries for the  North of Ireland, the Government are obliged to encourage their location in TSN  areas. In my opinion, they have done the opposite.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Recently, as part of a  delegation from the West Belfast and Greater Shankill Enterprise Council  on a trade mission to Lawrence, near Boston in the United States, I met with people  from both areas for the first time. Delegates  met with businesspeople and US state officials who had been on trips  organised by Invest NI to the North of Ireland, including many parts of Belfast, yet they were never shown west Belfast or the Shankill. Is Invest NI ashamed  of us? That is indicative of how British direct rule Government Ministers  treated the area that I represent. Members  must not allow devolved Ministers to treat communities in the same way.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There should be specific rate relief measures for  businesses that locate in TSN areas, to draw in new investors and assist  existing businesses that have already shown great courage and leadership in  helping communities to overcome their difficulties. It must be a priority to  give TSN areas assistance to allow them to catch up with the rest of the  island.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A review is ongoing, and Members should wait for the  recommendations. A blanket approach may not be the best way forward, and  Members must reserve judgement until all the evidence is before us. A report from the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment is  2002 stated:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;A blanket approach currently in practice meant that  benefits to the manufacturing industry were spread too thinly and did not allow  the Executive to focus resources where they  were most needed. Other sectors of  the economy did not benefit from this concession meaning that the policy of Industrial De-Rating was not  fair in its application.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That is an important statement from a Committee of the  previous Assembly. However, the new Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment may have a  different view.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">To vote for the motion would be to neglect our  responsibility, as elected representatives, to hear the evidence from the review  of industrial derating by the Economic Research Institute of Northern Ireland  (ERINI). Therefore, I will be opposing the motion but supporting amendment No  1. However, I welcome the fact that Members have debated the issue, and I hope  that the manufacturing community will take some reassurance from the Assembly. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I wish to speak in favour of the motion. At the outset, I can do no better than quote from  Hansard on an almost identical motion on 6 June 2006. The leader of the  Democratic Unionist Party Dr Paisley said: </p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I am delighted to speak in support of this motion &hellip;  The Government&rsquo;s proposals will have a terrible impact on industry. To say, as  certain Ministers from elsewhere have told us, that people are crying &ldquo;Wolf,  wolf!&rdquo; where there is no wolf &mdash; well, there are hounds and wolves in abundance,  and they are all sniping at the industries of Northern Ireland. We should be here  to protect those industries and do everything in our power to see that they are  safeguarded.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official Report, Bound Volume 19, p61, col 2].</span></span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I could also quote from the Democratic Unionist Party  manifesto, which supported a cap on industrial rates. The fact is that the  manufacturing base in Northern    Ireland has been in steady decline, and the number  of jobs is now down to something like 90,000 or 100,000. Manufacturing must  still be at the core of business activity.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In debate yesterday, Members spoke of the need to grow the  business sector. This morning, when debating the Welfare Reform Bill, contributors  spoke of the need to get more people economically active. We live in an  intensely competitive, global environment. Low-wage economies, including the  new Indian and Chinese tiger economies, put intense pressure on the industrial  sector to compete. The SDLP is gravely concerned that an increase in industrial  rates of over 25% will threaten the narrow manufacturing base in the North.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Concerns about job losses are not fanciful. The Government  have reported that the best-case scenario for job losses, after full industrial  rates are imposed, would be 10,000. The worst-case scenario would be 45,000 job  losses, with 20,000 accepted as being a realistic figure. However, the NIMFG  has projected a job-loss figure of 30,000.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Government have recognised the problem and have stalled the  planned phasing-in of industrial rating, which was set to reach 100% rate  liability by 2011. That is convincing evidence that the issue of industrial  rating is increasingly being accepted as a real problem. Manufacturers will be  forced to relocate, downsize, or even close. All companies are vulnerable to  closure if additional pressure is exerted to extract more money from an already  narrow profit margin of little more than  5%. The costs involved are huge. The total income at 100% rating has  been estimated at &pound;75 million &mdash; approximately &pound;750 for each worker. For small  businesses, or even large ones, that is a large sum to withdraw from the  business.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Our industrial policy rightly stresses innovation, to which  research and development is critical. For many companies, money extracted  through industrial rates is the same money  that they could use for R&amp;D. Northern Ireland industry exists in a  difficult economic climate. High energy costs are one major factor in that. One  major manufacturer, to whom I have spoken, has said that that was the single  biggest problem for him, and one that he wanted the Assembly to address.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">High insurance costs are also a feature of business life  here. Business can flow very easily from North to South. In the South, there is  a relatively favourable climate for manufacturing, including lower fuel duties.  We need to protect our industry. Through the Varney review of tax policy in Northern    Ireland, we are arguing strongly for  the equalisation of corporation-tax rates with the South. How could we be taken  seriously if, at the same time, we got rid of lower industrial rates, which is  one of the few competitive advantages that we have?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In 2005, the SDLP called  on the Government to delay the initiative and develop instead a menu of  reliefs and exemptions to support business  development as follows: first, measures to support vulnerable sectors  and encourage developing ones; secondly, assistance for businesses &mdash; services  or industrial &mdash; in areas of high unemployment and/or social deprivation;  thirdly, tailoring the rating system to take  account of the differing levels of energy consumption, spatial  requirements, and so on, that are necessary for various manufacturing  processes; and fourthly, change must be phased in on an affordable and  sustainable basis. A flexible rate relief and exemption scheme could contribute  greatly to addressing coherently the needs of our economy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There has been much talk recently that all property taxes  are a crude weapon that does not relate to ability to pay. The Minister of  Finance and Personnel is responding to concerns on domestic rating by  initiating a further review that will  include the issue of rates relief. Exactly the same applies to  industrial rating. Spatial requirements and profitability have no correlation.  At present, different sectors of industry are being shown no consideration.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said at the outset, I strongly support the original  motion and would neither welcome nor support amendment No 1.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind Members yet again that mobiles phones are not to be  switched on or used in any way in the Chamber.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>: I  welcome the opportunity to debate this very important issue again. I applaud  the efforts of the NIMFG. Its work over the past year in keeping such an  important issue at the top of the agenda must be highly commended. I am  delighted to say that the NIMFG has been invited to address the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and  Investment next week. I look forward to hearing them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Hundreds of people attended last year&rsquo;s event, at the  Waterfront Hall, in support of the focus group&rsquo;s efforts. The important fact that emerged from that event  and the subsequent debate in the Chamber was that they both had cross-party support. The commitment that was  given then still stands, and that is important.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am also aware of the  ongoing work of the Economic Research  Institute of Northern Ireland (ERINI). However, I remind Members that the original reason for introducing  industrial derating in Northern Ireland  was to allow industry here to compete with the low corporation tax rate that  had already been introduced in the Republic   of Ireland. That problem  still exists today.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise that Northern Ireland has a narrow  manufacturing base. One of the positive aspects of industrial derating was that  it could attract new inward investment to Northern Ireland.  Although the Department of Finance and Personnel will take the decision  on industrial rates, there is an economic aspect to the issue. For that reason,  I wrote recently to the Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment, Mr Nigel Dodds, and I was delighted to receive a response  today. He states that:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Department of Finance and Personnel has engaged  the Economic Research Institute (ERINI) to assess the effects of removing  industrial derating from manufacturing businesses. This work is expected to be  completed in September 2007.</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">My Department,  through Invest NI, continues to help Northern Ireland manufacturing companies  to improve their competitiveness through a broad portfolio of programmes aimed  at improving productivity, encouraging more  innovation and R&amp;D and encouraging businesses to seek out  opportunities in export markets.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">At least we now know that ERINI is expected to report in  September.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Last year, the economic subgroup dealt with the industrial  rates issue. The important point to emerge was the recognition of a need for an  overall package to assist industry in Northern Ireland. In many ways, the  extended guidelines of the Varney review team reflect that as well. We must  bear in mind that not just one issue needs to be addressed, but a package of  issues.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is also important to remember that the main beneficiaries of industrial derating are the  large companies in Northern    Ireland. We must recognise that if we are to  have political stability in Northern    Ireland, we also have to have a strong  economy. The Assembly will be judged on how it deals with economic issues.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is vital that we encourage growth in all sectors of the economy, particularly indigenous small and  medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Northern Ireland. Although I  understand the sensitivities that some Members have about the DUP&rsquo;s amendment,  the Alliance Party will support it.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McQuillan</strong>:  I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. Over the next few  years, the economy should be the Assembly&rsquo;s  number one priority. We must create the kind of environment that will  allow business to prosper and generate a greater opportunity for all in our  society.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although the nature of our economy will change, I have no  doubt that the manufacturing sector will have an important role to play in the  years ahead. We must, therefore, find the  best way to encourage manufacturers to come to Northern Ireland,  and to stay here.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are factors that businesses will take into account  when deciding where to set up and where to stay, and taxation is one such  factor. As we all know, corporation tax is an important consideration, but so  too is the question of rates. It is essential that we have the clearest  possible picture of the impact of rating on manufacturing in Northern Ireland,  and I welcome the research that ERINI is currently carrying out. That work will  be essential in making long-term decisions on industrial rates policy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As someone who believes that a strong economy is  fundamental to a stable political environment, I am committed to ensuring that future resources are targeted to where  they are most needed. It is unfortunate that, because of EU state aid law, we  are limited in what we can do. I hope that the Executive will reflect on  today&rsquo;s debate when they make their decisions in the autumn. I am sure that  whatever decision is taken will be in the best interests of Northern Ireland  manufacturers.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>: As tha oul Proaverb saes, frae mickle sterts cum muckle things.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We er stertin fae tha beginnin &ndash; aa&rsquo; fresh slaet efter tha  years o&rsquo; neglect fae oor direct rool Givermunt en yeers o&rsquo; heertacke an  bluidshed fae wi-in.</p>

	      <p class="B3BodyText">As the old proverb says, from small beginnings come great  things. Northern Ireland  is starting from the beginning, with a fresh slate after years of neglect from  our direct rule Government and years of heartache and bloodshed from within. It  may seem a monumental task to take Northern   Ireland from a war-torn state to where it should be: to  stabilise it socially and economically and to paint a new, realistic world  image of Northern Ireland  as a beautiful country, rich with culture, filled with warm people and ready to  step out onto the world stage. It is a monumental task indeed, but it begins  with the small things. One major step is to stabilise our economy by encouraging growth from within. I  support the DUP amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A short walk from the Chamber across the Great Hall to the  Senate Chamber is an elegant portrayal of the three realms that Northern  Ireland used to rely on to keep it afloat &mdash; linen, ships and agriculture. Once known as a giant in the manufacturing world,  renowned for quality, Northern Ireland  is now floundering and losing out to Third World  nations that had the foresight to encourage big business to invest. Those  nations then reaped the benefits through  increased labour and higher task dividends as businesses eventually  produce more. We must learn a hard lesson  from those who once looked to us for inspiration.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, it does not  have to be like that. In Northern Ireland, we still have the ability and desire to work for  ourselves, to thrive economically and to support our small nation. It is up to  the Assembly to facilitate that. It can be achieved by taking the necessary  steps to foster growth, not hamper it with the lure of quick or easy money.  Manufacturing accounts for around 90,000 jobs in the Province, in addition to a  further 45,000 supplementary jobs. That level must not only be sustained but it  must be increased. That can be achieved by a cap on industrial rates. That  would help to sustain the 6,000 small businesses in Northern Ireland that currently do  not enjoy the rates relief that is experienced by their counterparts on the mainland.  It is our job to promote the growth and to cap the rates.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For too long we have been reading newspaper articles about closures in, or downsizing of, our  industries. As our nation wakes up in a time of accountability and  prosperity, it is time that we read articles about more jobs, such as the  100,000 jobs needed over the next 10 years to sustain us, or about  international firms using our businesses and products due to their competitive  prices and superior quality. The Republic  of Ireland has consistently offered  taxation, insurance and rates at a much lower level than in Northern Ireland.  That country has been rewarded with a burgeoning business world and the  benefits that that invariably brings.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If a company is seeking a base where is it likely to go?  What side of the border will offer greater value for money? We must consider  those questions. There could be a loss of some 18,000 jobs if businesses will  have to pay industrial rates. That would be a blow that Northern Ireland  could not take.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In Northern    Ireland, we have become hardened to terrorism by the gun. That has held us back and  hampered prosperity. However, we cannot allow ourselves to be laden by  terrorism through taxation, a tactic of which the Labour Party is so fond. In  the UK,  just under 15% of jobs are in the manufacturing sector, as opposed to other EU  countries that have double that proportion. Why is that? The Government have  taxed local businesses out of existence yet they have not replaced it with  anything substantial.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That trend cannot be  allowed to continue in Northern Ireland. We must support the Federation of Small Businesses  and the Northern Ireland Manufacturing Group. Those bodies have stated that the  Northern Ireland economy and their own businesses must be able  to afford the rate. From small beginnings come great things. If businesses get  a shot at a good beginning, everyone  would reap the benefits of lower unemployment levels, more funds being available through regular income taxes,  less money being paid out in benefits and greater cash flow and prosperity  throughout the Province.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.  The current policy of industrial derating was introduced mainly as a response to growing competition in markets for manufactured goods from foreign  countries. In 2001, the Executive commissioned a study into the economic  impact of industrial derating, and the public consultation that followed  revealed broad support for the removal of the industrial derating policy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Along with other parties, the Committee for Finance and  Personnel and the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, Sinn F&eacute;in  supported the ending of industrial derating because measures were required that  would best support local businesses and their vital role in the economy. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) expressed a view that the revenues raised by the  abolition of industrial derating could help to fund Government borrowing  to deal with the capital funding deficit of &pound;6 billion. The ICTU pointed out that the current industrial  derating policy was inconsistent with the Programme for Government&rsquo;s aim to  promote a knowledge-based economy, given that the businesses benefiting from  derating were largely manual-labour-oriented.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Businesses must contribute to the cost of local government  services and the infrastructure in general, because they are often the primary  beneficiaries of such spending. Therefore, businesses should pay local taxes such as rates. However, the system must be  applied fairly to ensure that other  industries that make a significant contribution to the economy are  treated equally.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a huge responsibility on enterprise units at local  government level to ensure competitiveness, business  development, the securing of existing jobs and the development of new  ones. New council functions after the  review of public administration should include a system of local  government accountability for the spending  of commercial rates, as is currently the case in the South of Ireland.  Business rates should be ring-fenced for economic development. </p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A crucial aspect of strengthening enterprise is the  nurturing of new businesses, and part of that should involve lightening the  financial burden of those businesses during their start-up period. The  financial benefits to businesses on their  own will not contribute significantly to development unless the benefits  gained are used strategically by the businesses concerned. Therefore, a system  of rates relief should replace the current industrial derating system. Rates  relief for new businesses, and businesses located  in new TSN areas, should be based on compulsory, agreed and accountable action plans for those businesses.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The issue of industrial rates cannot be isolated from the  significant infrastructure deficit in the North of Ireland, the higher costs  for businesses here and the progressive squeezing of resources by the British  Treasury. Industrial rating is only one aspect of a much wider problem that  requires general reforms, including democratic  control of fiscal policy and the development of an all-Ireland taxation  system. The independent review currently being carried out by the Economic  Research Institute of Northern Ireland is the best way forward. Therefore, I  support amendment No 1, which considers all the options.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: Before I was elected as an MLA, I worked in various small  businesses in Northern    Ireland as a production manager in the  manufacturing sector, and I assure the House that that is a difficult  environment in which to work. There are huge pressures for survival, and small  businesses struggle against international competition from former eastern bloc  or Far Eastern countries. In an enlarged European Community, an additional  low-cost economy can compete directly with Northern Ireland. There are huge  pressures in the small business sector, particularly in the manufacturing  sector, which is open to global competition.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Geographically, Northern Ireland has several disadvantages, or challenges, to overcome. It is  situated on the periphery of Europe and  has a relatively small domestic market,  which means that additional transport costs are incurred and goods must  be exported. Most of our exports go to the rest of the United Kingdom, and that means paying for goods  to travel across the Irish Sea. We must ensure  that we do not over-burden local manufacturers to such an extent that they  cannot survive, and we must appreciate that there are huge challenges, both  locally and internationally.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Northern Ireland  Office has justified its proposal to end industrial derating by  reference to the infamous DTZ Pieda report, which estimated that industrial  rates would be only around 2&middot;7% of profits &mdash; and that is clearly unrealistic.  Other Members have said that professionals in that area have said that that  figure is unrealistic. I welcome the fact that a detailed review is under way.  It is hoped that it will come up with more realistic figures and demonstrate  how they could ultimately adversely affect local manufacturers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Manufacturing in Northern   Ireland is not just about the industrial heartland of East Belfast. Recent figures for manufacturing jobs in  each constituency covering the period to September 2005 showed that Upper Bann  had the highest quotient, with 9,514 jobs, followed by Fermanagh in the west of  the Province with 7,658 and then North Antrim.  East Belfast came in fourth. We are not  talking about some Belfast-based, old-fashioned heavy industry that has been  around for some time: we are talking about a very wide geographical spread,  with the bulk of the jobs being located outside Belfast.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. Does he acknowledge that as Upper Bann has a high number of manufacturing jobs  compared to other areas across the North and is also close to the border, it is  one of those constituencies most at risk of losing those jobs? If we do not resolve this matter, many  businesses, particularly in the Banbridge area, will transfer across to  the Republic of Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: The Member makes a valid point. If I were in that constituency  I would be particularly concerned.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Northern Ireland  has a higher prevalence of small businesses than does the rest of the United Kingdom,  and that in turn creates difficulties. It is  widely recognised that in smaller enterprises a higher proportion of the  turnover is spent on rates, and, ultimately, a higher proportion of the profit is spent on rates. Those businesses are  not running two or three shifts in a confined area with the equipment and buildings being used continually. They are probably only operating on an eight-hour  daily shift. Northern Ireland  has difficulties associated with the nature  of the employment and the size of the companies.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is also widely recognised that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  public sector is too large and its private  sector too small. Action must be taken to encourage the private sector.  It should not be burdened by taxes that put  money into the public sector, but that is exactly what happens when  rates are raised in the industrial manufacturing sector.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sir David Varney is conducting a major review of  corporation tax, but the outcome of that is not yet available. Those Members  who have met Sir David will appreciate that we have an up-hill task, as he is  taking the view of the central Exchequer. However, we must try to win.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must use what  mechanisms are under our control until something better comes along.  Industrial rating is under the control of the devolved Assembly. We must keep  those rates as low as possible; they would be increased at our peril. We must  reflect the needs of local manufacturers, and ensure that we do not create  additional burdens for them. I support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.  T&aacute; an-&aacute;thas orm deis a bheith agam labhairt ar an r&uacute;n t&aacute;bhachtach seo. I  am glad to have the opportunity to speak in support of the motion and of the  second amendment. I thank Mr Beggs and Mr Cree for bringing it to the Floor of  the House.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Manufacturing in Northern Ireland needs all the incentives  that it can get to enable it to engage in an increasingly competitive market,  in which emerging economies exert more and more pressure and in which margins  are squeezed, leaving manufacturers with less and less money for wages and  investment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The best-case scenario under higher industrial rates is job  losses of 10,000. The worst-case scenario is job losses of 45,000, although it  has been accepted that 20,000 is a realistic figure. However, the potential  ramifications of a higher rate are further job losses in the service industries.  Taking that into account, a more realistic projection of job losses is about  30,000. Manufacturers would be forced to relocate, downsize or even close. All  companies are vulnerable to closure under additional pressure to extract more  money from an already narrow profit margin of little more than 5%. Under those  circumstances, companies have little incentive to plan for the future through  investment, research and development. That greatly hinders wider economic  growth and competition.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Support for manufacturing has fallen from &pound;150 million each  year in the late 1990s to just &pound;50 million: &pound;100 million has been taken away  from industry. That support used to be shared by over 1,000 companies; however,  it is now focused on a handful of large companies, and the majority of  manufacturers now receive no support. At present, manufacturers pay &pound;20 million  each year in rates. Five years ago, when the policy was planned, a typical  manufacturing firm received money from the Government; now it must pay them.  The situation has changed drastically, and policy changes to reflect that make  sense.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Global competition is intense. It may, therefore, be  cheaper in the long term for companies that are faced with higher rates to  relocate to other areas, particularly eastern Europe. Moreover, they have the  option to consolidate and streamline. For example, food and drink manufacturers  have already set up plants in the South of Ireland, where, in addition to the  other incentives available there,  corporation tax is only 12&middot;5%.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Communities that have worked to help themselves by establishing co-operatives and developing  enterprise agencies will see their efforts wasted if tenants are forced out of business by higher rates. Those  businesses will either fold or move to low-tax areas, leaving behind  empty factories that will be of little benefit to owners, workers or the  Government. Instead of driving manufacturing out of Northern Ireland, the Assembly must  do everything possible to ensure that it stays and must give it every possible  encouragement to develop in the future.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Rather than create  increased revenue for Government, the danger is that increased  industrial rates will lead to diminishing returns through factory closures and unemployment. Make no mistake about it &mdash;  increasing industrial rates will  cost jobs. That is certain. Unemploy&shy;ment increases the demand for other  Government services, including health,  benefits and housing. If more must be  spent on those areas than is raised through rates, where is the gain?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Northern Ireland&rsquo;s peripheral location in Europe means  that manufacturers here must have extra  storage facilities to help mitigate the impact of transport costs and  possible delivery delays. They should not be penalised with higher rates bills  for their efforts to overcome the effects of peripherality. On the contrary,  they must be given every support to overcome those difficulties and others,  such as high energy and insurance costs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion and the second amendment.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>:  I support the campaign to cap industrial rates in Northern Ireland. Last June the  Assembly voted to freeze rates at 25%, but a lot has changed for many parties  since then. Indeed, although some parties are almost unrecognisable from this  time last year, surely they are prepared to speak up for our manufacturing  sector.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">No less a person than Dr Ian Paisley himself said in last  June&rsquo;s debate that we must ensure that industrial rates are kept at 25%. Mind you, he said a month later that no  unionist who is a unionist would go into Government with Sinn F&eacute;in. He  also said that Sinn F&eacute;in was not fit to be in Government in Northern Ireland  and that it would get there over the dead bodies of unionists. Therefore he has  a track record of changing his mind.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly should be aware of the tremendous difficulties  with which Northern Ireland  manufacturers have had to deal in the past  number of decades. Political stability and lasting peace mean that we  now have an opportunity to build Northern Ireland and create new  jobs and prosperity for all our people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those in the  manufacturing industry are telling us that they need the Assembly&rsquo;s help  to ensure that industrial rates are kept at  a level that they can bear. The Northern Ireland Manufacturing Focus Group is telling us that the  introduction of a full industrial rate would cost thousands of jobs and  devastate our economy. In many cases, those people have kept businesses going  throughout the most difficult circumstances in our darkest days. Now is  certainly not the time to place obstacles in their way. They need our support  and help, and they are entitled to expect it. They have asked that the strong positive signal be sent that the manufacturing  sector has the support of the new Government. Today presents us with an  opportunity to send that signal.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The House supported the  measure a year ago. At that time that support was easy to give because  we did not have the responsibility to deliver on our promises. That has all changed, and today we must prove that we  deserve to be here by seizing the opportunity to make a real difference  to the lives and well-being of our people by taking  action to help Northern    Ireland businesses to thrive.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: The Alliance Party leans towards supporting the DUP amendment  because it captures the issue in a slightly more balanced and realistic way.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Industrial derating needs to be seen as a means to an end  rather than as an end in itself. That end is about putting in place a robust and effective package to support our  local economy and to encourage economic growth. I understand why the  manufacturing sector wants to retain  industrial derating, and in the absence of any other mechanism, that  retention is particularly important. In the absence of any wider package, it is  important that the Assembly lobbies for some form of industrial derating to address the problems that the manufacturing  sector is encountering.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, it is important to appreciate that there are  limitations to industrial derating as an industrial policy. It is in effect a  blunt instrument in two main respects. First,  it helps those businesses that have larger premises, but it is of more marginal benefit to small- and  medium-sized enterprises than those working in the service sector,  particularly those companies that focus on information technology &mdash; biotech and  nanotech and all the different knowledge enterprises for which Northern Ireland  is trying to create a greater foothold. Those enterprises are the core  industries of the new global economy and the future.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, industrial  derating does not focus assistance on those areas of the economy in  which there is the greatest potential for growth and increased profit. It  spreads the benefits evenly and does not make any distinction between the different  sectors.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Industrial derating is also a defensive industrial policy that tries to protect Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  assets. That is understandable given the decline of manufacturing over  recent years and the increased competition from emerging economies, especially  those in the Far East.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We need to go on the offensive to achieve the economy that  we want to see in Northern    Ireland. We have seen how the Celtic tiger approach has transformed the  economy of the Republic   of Ireland over the past  20 years. We are not in a position to repeat what has been achieved there,  because it was the product of a unique set of circumstances and a particular  time. However, the Assembly should aspire to achieve similarly rapid economic growth and societal transform&shy;ation. We should  consider how we might reach that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly should focus on putting in place a package of  economic reforms to assist industry and the manufacturing base. We must attract  new inward investment, encourage entrepreneurship and appeal to the new growth  sectors, especially in information technology. The Assembly should consider  tax-varying powers and whether we should have fiscal autonomy. Corporation tax  is a major concern for all parties. The Assembly should consider R&amp;D  credits; levels of investment in research and development in Northern Ireland  are well below those of our competitors, and that should be addressed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The complaint that I hear most often from the business  sector is the need to address the skills deficit. Young people emerging from  schools and colleges are not meeting the demands of the industrial sector. That  gap needs to be addressed quickly. We also need to invest in our  infrastructure.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion proposes something that is not covered in the  existing Budget. Funds will have to be found; I note that the proposers of the motion have not addressed where  they intend to find those resources. That said, the proposal is worthy of  consideration, but it needs to be addressed within the comprehensive spending  review as part of an overall package. We need to be quite blunt: choices may  have to be made between one type of industrial support and other options that  might arise, either as part of a financial package or as a result of the Varney  review. We may not have the resources or  the ability to fund all of these, and we need to ensure that what we  choose is the most effective means of addressing  economic growth in the shortest possible time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must have open minds on this. It is important that we  not let the issue of industrial derating fall off the table. It is currently  the only relief available to manufacturers. However, there are other means that  might be more effective in addressing their needs and those of other sectors of  the economy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I support the amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr P Robinson)</strong>: I understand that it is pretty wet in a number  of places. The Connswater shopping centre in east Belfast has had to be closed. There are  problems in the Dundonald leisure park, and also in this Building. I suspect  that we will have to get our wellies on tonight.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I congratulate the Members from East   Antrim and North Down for securing this debate. For the third time  in the month that this Assembly has been up and running, I am on my feet  addressing Members on the issue of rates.  Members&rsquo; interest in the issue demonstrates the importance of local  taxes to both businesses and householders.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although we would all prefer to see local taxes at a low  level, I hope that, after yesterday&rsquo;s debate and today&rsquo;s discussions, Members  recognise that there are no easy answers and that there are consequences to all  decisions. It is my role, as Minister of Finance and Personnel, to spell out what those are, so that, when they decide  on the motion and the amendment, Members are armed with information.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Either we reduce the amount of money that is raised to fund  public services, or we shift the rate burden onto other businesses or  householders. Every penny raised from rates  stays here in Northern    Ireland and is invested in public  services. Decisions cannot be taken lightly. There are consequences to all  reliefs and exemptions. Either money &mdash; and therefore programmes &mdash; are forgone,  or ratepayers pay more.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that this issue be seen in the proper  context. Let me set out the financial implications of the decisions that the  Assembly and Executive will have to take when addressing the issue in the  autumn. The cumulative cost of keeping this form of relief at its current rate  of 30% liability &mdash; compared to the phasing schedule set out in the legislation  &mdash; is estimated to be &pound;144 million between now and 2011-12. Thereafter, it will  be around &pound;50 million a year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText" style="text-indent:0cm;">If we estimate the cost of  restoring rate liability to 25% and keeping it at that percentage, the  cumulative figure is just under &pound;160 million: &pound;19&middot;1 million in 2008-09; &pound;39&middot;1  million in 2009-10; &pound;40&middot;1 million in 2010-11; and &pound;61&middot;5 million in 2011-12.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We face a dilemma, because the future of manufact&shy;uring in Northern Ireland  is, or should be, important to us all. We have a proud industrial heritage,  which is based on a world-class manufacturing sector that has been the main wealth creator for generations.  However, we are also moving with the times by encouraging all business  sectors to grow and create an economy fit for the twenty-first century.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Yesterday, I outlined statistically how our manufact&shy;uring  base had declined over the years. We must assess what further impact the direct  rule Minister&rsquo;s proposals might have on that sector. The motion asks that the  resolution made by the Hain Assembly on 6 June 2006, calling on the Secretary  of State for Northern    Ireland &mdash; pending the restoration of  devolution &mdash; to cap industrial rates at 25%, be honoured. Even though the  circumstances have changed and rate liability has increased to 30%, we must  deal with the figure stated in the motion, because many of us made manifesto  pledges on the issue, albeit perhaps not in the precise terms laid down in  today&rsquo;s motion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The direct rule Ministers undertook a preliminary review. Following approaches from the Northern Ireland  Manufacturing Focus Group and Amicus, officials in my Department worked with  those bodies on the preliminary review. That exercise proved to be  inconclusive, but it resulted in a reduction in the planned rate of increase  for 2007-08. Instead of 35%, the Government conceded 30%, pending a full review  of the policy this year. Jeff Rooker agreed  to that review after intense lobbying from local manufacturers, and I  know that my parliamentary colleague David Simpson was closely involved in  securing that commitment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We are now in control of the destiny of this policy, and I am glad to tell Members that the review has  already begun. The Department of Finance and Personnel has engaged the  Economic Research Institute of Northern Ireland (ERINI) to undertake a rigorous  study of the effectiveness and impact of the  policy, and it has already begun to talk to business organisations. The  review in itself will not fully answer the  question, but it will allow us to take more informed decisions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">To put it starkly, the issue is about whether rates bills  are likely to be the last straw that will force our good firms across the  border, or, worse still, out of business. At a time when we are seeking to  attract business to the Province, it is critical that we provide the best  environment possible for industry.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">ERINI will also undertake a full and impartial economic  assessment, looking at the broader issue of whether the money needs to be left  in the pockets of the private sector to enable it to compete, or whether there is a better way in which to ensure Northern  Ireland&rsquo;s future economic success by using that money for investment in  public services. It is important that we make our judgements on the basis of  the evidence.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am hopeful that the study&rsquo;s findings will help us make  the right decision about the appropriate level of rates for manufacturing businesses. The Assembly would look  foolish if it took a decision without considering such an evidence-based  report. ERINI will conclude the exercise in  the autumn, and I will report its findings, and my Department&rsquo;s  assessment, to the Assembly, taking into account all the relevant available  evidence.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although it is timely to have a debate on industrial  rating, it would not be timely to make a final decision in advance of the  outcome of the independent analysis. Moreover,  there is a growing understanding that the only sensible way in which  these matters can ultimately be judged is  to set each issue alongside competing priorities as part of the  Executive&rsquo;s Programme for Government, and alongside the decisions that the  Executive will take on the comprehensive spending review for the next three  years. Therefore I hope that Members will support the reasoned amendment that  sets out that course of action.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I listened to the debate, I found myself agreeing with many of the points that were made. I will  not assess all the points about the impact of the reintroduction of  rating to the manufacturing sector, because, pending the outcome of the  analysis, I am not satisfied that we have all the answers yet.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We all want what is fair  and reasonable to ensure that our vital manufacturing industry remains  competitive and vibrant. I want to see increased foreign investment and, with  Executive colleagues, I am urgently looking at areas where we might be able to  make an impact. Indeed, Members will be aware of the work that Sir David Varney  has undertaken in this area.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Every Member is aware of  the major financing issues facing  the Assembly and the hard decisions that we will have to take shortly on  health provision, care for the elderly, the education of our children, public  transport and a host of other priorities.  Therefore a careful balance must be  struck. Furthermore, even if we were to continue with the phasing out of  derating &mdash; and no decision has yet been  taken on that matter &mdash; we may need to consider other ways of supporting our manufacturing base outside the  rating system. Until a more detailed analysis of the impact on manufacturing is available, I cannot reach any conclusion  on that matter. However, there are other positions between industrial derating  and charging the full rate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Ensuring economic growth must be the number one priority of  the Executive and the Assembly, and our policies must be shaped to deliver that  outcome. The Assembly must address how best to achieve that goal. I am grateful  for Members&rsquo; contributions today, and I will come back to the Assembly when the  review has been completed.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Every Member is sympathetic to the plight of those in the manufacturing sector,  and that has been the tone of the debate.  The DUP&rsquo;s amendment &mdash; more so than the substantive motion &mdash; represents a  sound footing for the Assembly and the Executive on which to proceed with regard to industrial rates, especially in relation to the pending ERINI report on this  important subject. I do not wish to pre-empt the report, but the  amendment puts the matter into a proper legislative and governmental context.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I look forward to seeing the proposer of the motion, Mr  Cree, in the Lobby supporting amendment No 1. He will certainly be there if he  wants to remain true to what he said yesterday during the debate on the Supply  resolution:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;At the end of the  summer, we will begin the Budget preparations for 2008-09. That Budget  should emerge from the Programme for Government. It will have a limited number  of overarching priorities that will guide departmental spending plans. Members  must ensure, through the various Committees, that the process that is adopted  allows for accountability. The establishment of priorities is crucial, given  that financial resources are limited.&rdquo; &mdash; <span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official Report, Vol 22, No 10, p396, col 2].</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">If the proposer is true to his word, I look forward  to seeing him support the DUP amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister and Mr Shannon spoke about our proud  manufacturing tradition, and when one thinks of industry in Northern Ireland,  images of massive manufacturing enterprises such as Harland and Wolf, and  Shorts are instantly conjured up. Members on all sides lamented the decline in  the manufacturing sector. The decline in traditional manufacturing jobs in the  Strangford constituency has been startling in its speed. Gone are the once huge  and significant employers such as Saintfield Yarns Ltd and the linen mills in  Comber and Killyleagh. The most recent figures show a decline in employment in  the manufacturing sector from 4,624 in 2001 to 4,200 in 2003. Those figures are  historic, so I am sure that they are much worse today.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That situation is replicated across the country, and for  that reason there is sometimes a false belief that the manufacturing sector is  lost forever. That is certainly not true.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: I  thank the Member for quoting so well from the speech that I made yesterday, but  does he agree that industrial derating is a priority?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  If the debates that have taken place in the Chamber over the past few weeks are  anything to go by, Members have many priorities. Today&rsquo;s Budget Bill debate and  the Finance Minister&rsquo;s response show that the economy is one of the Assembly&rsquo;s  highest priorities, and I support that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The number of employees in the manufacturing sector is well  down, but it is still about 80,000 people. That  is not an insignificant number, especially when one factors in how many  family members and dependents rely on those jobs. The manufacturing sector  represents approximately one quarter of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  private sector employment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although there is rightly much focus on generating new, high-value-added jobs in the technology,  information and communication technology or financial services and  banking sectors, we cannot afford to lose our manufacturing base. Mr O&rsquo;Loan  spoke of how we must retain a manufacturing sector. He is right. Not just  because of some sort of snobbery that says that a job that results in an end  product &mdash; that produces a widget &mdash; is better  than a service-sector job, but because if  any more jobs in that sector are lost, they might prove near impossible  to replace. There is much evidence that some of those service-sector jobs  depend on jobs in the manufacturing sector.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Neeson spoke of the circumstances that brought about the  retention of industrial derating. That poses the  question: have those circumstances been completely resolved? The main reasons for industrial  derating&rsquo;s being introduced in Northern Ireland were the deteriorating  competitive positioning of manufacturing in the 1980s, the erosion of our  manufacturing base, and difficulties in attracting foreign direct investment.  Those are very much the same problems that the Northern Ireland economy faces today. Many unique, or certainly  peculiar, problems also exist that  are overemphasised in Northern Ireland. These include high costs for energy, transport&shy;ation,  insurance, waste, property and tax.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The need to enhance our competitive position has been a  common theme during the debate. Northern Ireland suffers from several key disadvantages compared  to economic competitors such as the Republic of Ireland. Corporation tax was mentioned, as was the skills deficit.  Infrastructural problems should also be considered. A question that must be  answered is: can we afford to do away with the one advantage that we enjoy?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Considerable success has been achieved since the motion was  passed in the House, and many congratul&shy;ations are owed to those industrialists  who fought hard to cap the level of industrial rating at 30%. I suspect that  the prospect of having full industrial rates is extremely unlikely now. Mr Beggs, Mr Cree, Mr O&rsquo;Loan and others  spoke of job losses and other impacts.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Draw your remarks to a close please.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I certainly will.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that we wait for the conclusions of the  report from ERINI, from which we should learn the full impact of industrial rates.  Members can then decide the best way forward, and not before.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Before commencing my speech, I declare an  interest as a former employee of the Northern Ireland Manufacturing  Focus Group. That fact has been entered in the Register of Members&rsquo; Interests.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Many Members will know of my involvement with this issue in  the past. In fact, many of those present will have attended the Waterfront  Hall, where they witnessed the strength of feeling on the issue. Others will have participated in the debate during the  so-called Hain Assembly. I have  talked to quite a few people during council  meetings, and, more recently, during the hustings in the run up to the  election, many Members will have met with representatives of the industrial  sector.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I recall the First Minister, along with several other  colleagues, visiting a factory in my constituency, where he gave some warm  words of encouragement to the workers. As has already been mentioned, the First  Minister&rsquo;s emphatic commitment to ensure that industrial rating is kept at 25%  is appreciated.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The issues are broadly known, and I do not intend to  regurgitate the arguments. As the Minister of Finance and Personnel has  mentioned, he is aware of many of the arguments. I do want to discuss the  reasons for the motion&rsquo;s having been tabled today, and, to a certain extent,  the issue of financial responsibility, which has been mentioned.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although many companies in Northern Ireland are struggling with the burden of industrial rates,  manufact&shy;uring is not on its knees. This country has some great companies that are competing daily in a global  economy. Every day, the prices of fuel and electricity increase, workers need more pay and more machinery is required.  Due to that, companies have to invest continually to continue competing. The  problem that companies face in this global  economy is that they cannot increase their prices. Therefore, there is a squeeze on their return. This  impacts on training and research and development, and all the measures that we  have implored our people to undertake.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The problem is that investment decisions are being made daily, and the impact of that is not felt  immediately. Just because a decision is taken that a factory will be  built in Hungary,  or across the border, it does not automatically follow that the home-based  factory will immediately close.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Businesses are disappearing on a daily basis. There cannot  be a constituency in Northern    Ireland that has not had a major employer  close down, and the sad thing is that that does not have to be the case.  Members representing border constituencies will know about the number of  businesses that are growing on the other side of the border. Mid Ulster has been identified as an area most at  risk, spreading to Dungannon and Upper Bann.  Each month of delay means that another factory closes and people lose their  jobs, and they end up working part time in retail and tourism rather than in the highly paid jobs that they previously held.  Stacking shelves may be better than  nothing, but it is not the way to give people the skills they want to  learn.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Time is of the essence, and Mr Storey, one of the proposers  of the motion, said in the past that he felt that there had been great  reluctance and dragging of feet on the issue. That should not be the case.  Urgency is needed. Let us put our money where our mouth is.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is the issue of financial responsibility, and the proposers of the amendment want to introduce a  degree of financial responsibility, which is to be commended. My  experience during the campaign was that no one adopted anything less than a responsible attitude. When the  Northern Ireland Manufacturing Focus Group came to the Committee to argue for a  level of 25%, it did not argue for 0%, although it appreciated the comments of  Mr Paisley Jnr, who thought that it should. In addition, the group did not  refuse to participate in skilling and reskilling the workforce. It is a  responsible group.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to clarify that  industrial rating is different from other issues being discussed, such  as personal care. Increasing the level of industrial rating will decrease revenue, because businesses will take steps to  ensure that that is the case.  Companies with three or more factories will merge them; others will  relocate, downsize, or automate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It must also be appreciated that much of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  manufacturing sector resides in rural constituencies, and there would be a huge  knock-on effect for the whole of the rural economy if such factories were to be lost &mdash; something that the  Assembly would want to deal with.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Then there is the  ultimate sanction. In my constituency there is a company called  Sanmina-SCI. In two weeks time it will close down its operation, and there will  be a loss of 300 jobs to the economy &mdash;  &pound;500,000 in wages alone. The company is closing down here because the  ten acres it occupies are worth &pound;27 million, and it can make its products elsewhere. That is why Members need to deal  with this matter. The manufacturing industry is not dead &mdash; it makes a huge contribution to our economy &mdash; but it  wants to see a positive message coming from the Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier, Mr Cree made a point about the land border. It is  true &mdash; Northern Ireland is  the only part of the United Kingdom to have a land border. Mr Paul Maskey said that he sympathised with the situation but  was unsure about what we were going to do about it. Mr O&rsquo;Loan put  forward an eloquent proposition explaining things, and Mr Neeson, who is no  longer here, spoke well and was complimentary about the Waterfront Hall &mdash; it  seems that the party of opposition appears not to be in opposition on this  particular issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McQuillan mentioned research and the state-aid rule. One  of the great advantages of industrial rating is that it does not fall foul of  state aid rules. Mr Shannon spoke of monumental encouragement and getting off  our knees. Members also talked about productivity.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Shannon also said, in a debate last year, that he and  his party had been to the Secretary of State on this issue eight or nine months  earlier &mdash; yet, here we are, one year on, still talking about the same matter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I should also mention that Stephen Moutray &mdash; although he  did not speak in today&rsquo;s debate &mdash; has acknowledged the dire consequences that  might arise.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">To resolve those  issues, we must consider what is best for our manufacturing sector. I  was a little disappointed that Stephen Farry described the policy as a blunt  instrument. It is not a blunt instrument, but something that works. Without the  big factories that employ lots of people, the subcontractors go and the whole  thing falls down. If we take away the subcontractors, we take away the  retailers. A &pound;30 million fund was made available for electricity, but we have  dipped into it to the tune of only &pound;6 million this year, so there is money in  the budget.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We also need to find a way to increase Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  productivity. We are at full employment, but the Minister of Finance and  Personnel confirmed yesterday that we have been losing our productivity stance  since 1998. That is because we are surrendering well-paid manufacturing jobs with an average gross value added of  &pound;50,000 and replacing them with part-time employment  in retailing and leisure with a GVA of &pound;8,000 to &pound;12,000. We must invest  in manufacturing, which is the one area in which we can increase our  productivity.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Despite Simon Hamilton&rsquo;s quotes from Hansard &mdash; he also  seemed quite keen on quoting people when I saw him on television earlier &mdash; I  can tell him that there is a wide range of support for our point of view. Mervyn Storey talked about reluctance and foot  dragging. Ian Paisley Jnr said that the issue has been picked over so we  should simply ensure that the rates are capped at a low level as early as  possible, and get on with it. David Simpson talked about his personal  experience of the rates going from nought to 25%. I remind Members that, if we  return to the accelerator, the rates will rise from 30% to 50%. That is a huge  hike.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We do not expect a particular answer now, but we want to  send a message. Therefore, we ask Members to support the motion. We will not  support amendment No 1, not because we have not heard what people say, but  because we want to send a message. However, we ask Members to support amendment  No 2 because we think that there should be cross-party support on this very  important issue.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind Members that if amendment No 1 is made, I will still put  the Question on amendment No 2.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><em>Question put, </em>That amendment No 1 be made.</p>

	        Public Sector Jobs in West Tyrone</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. As Mr McElduff rises to propose his  motion, I see that he is properly dressed. On a serious matter, yesterday I noticed that a female Member appeared  to be carrying not only a handbag,  which one can accept as an accessory, but another piece of luggage as  well. I was under the impression that Members, and I do not stress gender, are  not to carry items into the Chamber. Will you give a ruling on that matter, Mr  Deputy Speaker?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Mr Robinson is correct. Members  should not carry large bags into the Chamber. The matter will be  referred to the Speaker.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  On a further point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. That was my concern about the  departure from the dress rules in the Chamber. If Members deviate from what has  been accepted, such as dress in the Chamber, we must be careful not to open the  door to other practices that might creep in and embarrass the safety of  Members.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The matter will be referred to the Speaker. The Member&rsquo;s party  Whip will probably inform him that this matter was discussed today in the  Business Committee, and no doubt there will  be further discussion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an  d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo inniu. I welcome the selection of this topic for the  Adjournment debate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am calling for a proactive approach by the Department of  Finance and Personnel in particular, as well as the wider Executive and other  Belfast-based Government Departments, towards decentralisation and the  relocation of public-sector jobs to West Tyrone and its principal towns, Omagh  and Strabane. I could easily broaden the scope of the debate to include any  areas beyond greater Belfast  &mdash; for example, west of the Bann is another recognisable geographical area where  there is a deficit in this matter. I recently tabled a question for written  answer to the Minister of Finance and Personnel, which was answered on 21 May  2007. The question was:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;to ask the Minister  of Finance and Personnel if he will make a statement detailing a proactive  approach regarding decentralisation and the location of public sector jobs, and  to make a specific commitment that areas west of the River Bann will receive  equality in this matter.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><span class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister of Finance and Personnel, Mr Peter Robinson,</span>  replied:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The consultation on  &lsquo;The Guiding Principles for the Location of Public Sector Jobs in Northern  Ireland&rsquo; which closed on 30 April 2007 is  the first step in developing a framework which would facilitate future decision-making  on the location of public sector jobs. Responses to the consultation are  currently being analysed. Once this work is complete I would wish to discuss  the matter further with the Executive Committee.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The &ldquo;first step&rdquo; has been mentioned; what are the next  steps?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">What prompted my question in the first instance? Obviously,  there are benefits to the economy of an area if public-sector jobs are located  there. It increases spending power and provides employment. In the Twenty-six  Counties, and in Scotland,  it has been found that the relocation of Government offices served to  regenerate the areas concerned; brought secure employment with attractive  salaries; encouraged people originally from the areas to return to live and work there; and boosted the commercial life of the  towns.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A lot is said in the regional development strategy, Shaping Our Future, about the importance of  sustainable communities.  Opportunities are presented by the review of public administration. It has been said that the increase in  population &mdash; the result of relocating public-sector jobs to various places &mdash; strengthened by the security of  employment, ensures critical mass for the maintenance and expansion of local  schools and local businesses.<strong> </strong>That is the business of sustainable communities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the regional development strategy there is a quote that  I want to draw to the attention of the House:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;In the context of  achieving the optimal balance between Belfast and the rest of the Region, the Strategy promotes  the decentralisation of public sector employment to Londonderry  and the main towns thereby augmenting their range of service functions. Even on  a modest scale this could bring significant local economic benefits, support  town centre revitalisation, underpin and encourage private sector investment.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Another reason for asking this question and raising this  issue today is that my constituents in West Tyrone are fed up travelling to  work that is considerably far away when they should have options a lot closer  to home. In 2002, I asked the then Minister of Finance and Personnel, Se&aacute;n  Farren, to detail the number and location of public-sector employees, by  Department, who live, for example, in the Omagh district but travel to work  outside it. There were significant numbers of people employed by the Civil  Service, or in public-sector jobs, and who lived in the Omagh and Strabane  districts, travelling to Belfast, Derry, or elsewhere to their jobs in the Civil Service.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Many of those people are on waiting lists, seeking transfer  to a post closer to home. There are real human stories about, for example,  women who are pregnant and who are on a waiting list, and who are scored in a  welfare-type system for suitability for transfer to a post nearer home. The M1  and M2 motorways are full of cars in the mornings. People feel as if they know  each other because they see one another in the early hours of the morning,  every day of the week.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I also raise this question because of the recent, incomplete consultation exercise on &lsquo;Guiding  Principles for the Location of Public Sector Jobs&rsquo;. Armagh  and Templepatrick were the two venues for public consultations. Limavady was  also chosen, but that event was cancelled in unsatisfactory circumstances  regarding its scheduling, advertisement and promotion &mdash; or lack of promotion. I  made a strong case at the time for Omagh to be the location for a consultation  exercise of that nature where people could come along and make their case for  the location of public-sector jobs in West Tyrone.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate that other Members will feel equally strongly.  The generality of the issue is relevant. I was pleased that, in a subsequent letter to the chief executive of the Western Education and Library Board, the  corporate services director of the Department of Finance and Personnel  acknowledged that, in light of feedback, he recognised that holding one of the  workshops in a central location in the west, such as Omagh, would have been  helpful.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I was pleased to get that acknowledgement in that letter,  which was dated 23 April.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  I cannot. I have only 10 minutes, and I have a significant statement to make.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Omagh is a suitable  place for the relocation of public-sector  jobs, as is Strabane. In the immediate future, Omagh should have the benefit of a consultation exercise. I would  like the Minister and his senior colleagues to understand the strength of  feeling on this matter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A public-sector ethos already exists in Omagh. Organisations such as the Western Education and  Library Board, the Department for Regional Development, a Roads Service  division and DOE Planning Service have offices there, as did the former health  trust for the area. The associated  expertise helps to provide a critical mass of public-sector employees  who can supply essential support in the event of any planned relocation initiative. There is also a range of available  office space and potential  development sites; a large pool of potential employees with  complementary competencies; and a first-class education and training infrastructure.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Omagh and Strabane,  therefore, both offer value-for-money options. Furthermore, they are  both designated new TSN areas. I refer the  Minister to submissions from the former president of the Chamber of  Commerce in Omagh, Kevin Martin. I also refer him to a report by academic  Cormac Duffy about Belfast  centrism in the location of public-sector jobs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I can equally make the case for Strabane, and I certainly  intend to keep in touch with the Department on that issue. I believe that the  recent establishment by the two Governments of the North-West Gateway  initiative should help to shine a spotlight on the needs of Strabane. Strabane  is ever mindful of the experience in the Twenty-six Counties whereby selected  counties have benefited from the relocation of public-sector jobs. I commend  the Strabane Employment Task Force on the good work that it has carried out, in  association with Strabane District Council, to bring this matter to public  attention.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I call  on the Government, the Executive and the Department of Finance and  Personnel to adopt a more serious and proactive approach to the relocation of public-sector jobs to areas west of the Bann,  not least the West Tyrone constituency. I would welcome any initiative  in the short term &mdash; indeed, in the immediate term, I hope &mdash; that is aimed at  listening to the views of local government,  civic representatives, and business and  community representatives in Omagh and Strabane. I invite the Minister  and his senior officials to take the opportunity  to listen to those views, and I would be very happy to host an event to  facilitate that.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>:  The debate focuses on the constituency of West Tyrone, but it is has relevance  for east Tyrone and further afield, too.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">All too often in Northern Ireland, there is a perception  of a Belfast  bias. There is a mistaken belief that life begins and ends on arrival at  Lisburn or Glengormley. That is clearly not correct, but as a resident of  Stewartstown in County   Tyrone and a  representative for Mid Ulster, I would say that, would I not? Given the large  population of the greater Belfast  area, it is obvious that many jobs will be located there. However, the  Government have a role to play to ensure that, where possible, other areas of Northern Ireland,  particularly west of the Bann, receive their fair share of public-sector jobs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The rural economy has suffered greatly in recent years. The agriculture industry has faced falling  revenues and has had to deal with the impact of BSE and the outbreak of  foot-and-mouth disease. We have also witnessed a staggering growth in house  prices, placing homes beyond the reach of first-time buyers, and the threat of  closure hanging over many schools due to falling rolls.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is therefore more vital than ever that people are  encouraged to stay in the west of the Province, and the availability of  public-sector jobs is a major factor in achieving that.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  Does the Member agree that the emphasis on the west of the Bann masks the  impact of the under-representation of Civil Service jobs in the eastern areas  of the Province? For example, recent figures from an academic suggest that  there is an under-representation of 3,000 public-sector jobs in East Antrim. Furthermore, there is not one mile of  motorway in my constituency. There is nothing in the north-east comparable to  the north-west tourism initiative. Does the Member agree that an unfair  distribution of jobs exists and that it has an impact on the east of the  Province?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>:  Yes, in my opening remarks I said that the issue affects areas other than the  west of the Bann. There is too much emphasis on the Belfast area. It is as if everything starts  and stops in Belfast.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It makes more sense for Government to ensure that  public-sector jobs are spread throughout Northern Ireland. That is not only  to ensure a fair distribution &mdash; which is a worthy end in itself &mdash; but to  support the rural economy and remove some of the pressure from the  infrastructure in Belfast.  There is life beyond the city limits of Belfast,  and it must be sustained and supported. The existence of a vibrant economy in  the west of the Province &mdash; and the east &mdash; will benefit not only those of us who  are fortunate enough to live there.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  Barry McElduff will not have been surprised that Members have mentioned other  areas to his entirely proper defence of the  interests of west Tyrone. Indeed, he broadened the issue in his remarks.  It is important to be aware at the outset that no policy exists on the dispersal of Government jobs. There is a  policy on how to assess a proposal if one arises, but there is an  absence of a policy on the central issue. That gap must be filled. I, and my party, want decentralisation to happen.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Two current initiatives  bear on this issue. However, as I have said, they are inadequate. The  first is Workplace 2010, and the second is the Department of Finance and  Personnel&rsquo;s consultation on &lsquo;Guiding Principles for the Location of Public  Sector Jobs in Northern Ireland&rsquo;, which closed in April 2007. </p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Workplace 2010 is a major part  of the Civil Service reform programme. Its objective is to modernise the  Government estate; its method is to sell off around three quarters of the  estate and lease it back, with a contract  to upgrade and service the buildings. A  term in the contract provides a cost for office dispersal, if that is  required. However, the term contains no imperative  to decentralise. Most importantly, Workplace 2010 points to a  rationalisation of the estate towards a smaller number of larger buildings and  the disposal of surplus buildings.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The consultation document, &lsquo;Guiding Principles for the Location of Public Sector Jobs in Northern Ireland&rsquo;, gives me some cause for concern. The document is  set in the context of the review of public administration. Although it states  that its principles may be adopted more widely, the document does not  address the central issue of the  location of the entire Civil Service establish&shy;ment. Usefully, the  document mentions the regional development strategy and spells out the benefits  of decentralisation: local economic benefits; supporting town-centre  revitalisation; underpinning private-sector investment; and a fairer sharing of  resources.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The consultation document also mentions the Department of  Agriculture and Rural Development&rsquo;s guide to rural proofing &mdash; a guide that the  current policy fragrantly ignores. I have no doubt that the many principles for  a framework for public-sector jobs location that are proposed in the document  form a useful basis for consideration, and I recognise that they include supporting development in areas of  deprivation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This is not an easy debate. It is wise to recognise that  there are real arguments for centralisation. Service delivery must be local  when it cannot be done electronically or by mail. However, bringing centres of  administration &mdash; rather than service-delivery points &mdash; close to each other,  brings economies of scale and a degree of connectedness that may be very  important. Capital cities develop for good reasons. For example, how many  political parties in the Assembly have their Northern   Ireland headquarters outside Belfast?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members cannot ignore  the importance of connected&shy;ness between the Administration and the political  system at the Assembly. In arguing for decentralisation, I am arguing against powerful forces, but I argue  nonetheless. Essential areas of discussion will include an appraisal of the relative costs of different solutions.  That includes the cost of change, which will not be negligible.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The efficiency of any proposed solution must be tested against others, including any loss in  connectedness and any potential time  wasted by certain officers in travelling. The gain in local economic  development must be considered, as well as the reduction in miles travelled and congestion. How does the trend towards fewer  large buildings fit in with decentralisation? The approach down South  seems to have been quite different, where small units have been decentralised.  How will proper opportunities be offered for career progression? How will the  critical issue of staff be dealt with in relocation proposals? Are some  departmental sections easier to hive off from the centre? The transfer of the  teachers&rsquo; pension branch to Derry seems like a  model example. Equality issues must be addressed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have one practical suggestion, but it is not offered with  any certainty. Although Derry cannot be ignored in this discussion, it cannot  be all about Derry. The guidelines refer to  hubs with over 20,000 people and give the examples of Ballymena to the north,  Newry to the south and Omagh to the west. Places such as those might be a good  way to move forward. That is not a definitive position on my part or on the  part of the SDLP. Barry McElduff and I may or may not agree on that list. Those  places have an advantage in that if people employed there wanted to seek promotion  in Belfast, it  would be possible for them to commute.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It will not be easy to find a perfect solution to this  problem. However, it is time to progress the issue of decentralisation. I ask  the Minister to do that.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind Members that the debate is about West Tyrone.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Deeny</strong>: I  am an MLA for West Tyrone, and I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on  this important issue on my area, my community and my patients. I was born and  reared on the east coast &mdash; although some people say that I have never been  reared &mdash; and am now living in the west, so perhaps I can consider the issue  from both angles. I thank my colleague Barry McElduff for raising the issue. I  read an article that he wrote in a local paper some years ago, in which he said  that almost 300 cars leave the Omagh and district area every day to come to the  greater Belfast  area. I was not political at all then, and it was the first time that I  realised that there was something wrong with that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am aware that the decentralisation of public sector jobs  has brought political support, but there may be a reduction in Civil Service  jobs and balancing may be seen in that context. I am also aware that unions and  senior officials oppose any decentralisation and would consider legal action  against it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will not go through the litany of jobs that have been  lost in the Omagh area, but 229 jobs were lost at Desmond and Sons&rsquo; shirt  factory in 2003. In April 2005, there were 85 job losses at Rixell Ltd. It is  estimated that 5% of Omagh&rsquo;s economically active people are currently  unemployed; that compares badly to the Northern Ireland average of 2&middot;5%.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Over the past couple of  years, I have taken an interest in Sion Mills because it lost its health  centre. In 2004, that exemplary community  lost 270 jobs from Herdman&rsquo;s linen mill; it also lost its police  station. Those closures happened because it was thought that people should work  in larger towns and cities and move away from rural areas. I have lived in a  rural area for 21 years, and I think that that is wrong. In Strabane, 565 jobs  were lost between 2003 and 2005, and as recently as January 2007, estimates of unemployment in the Strabane area show  that 1,116 people claim unemployment-related benefits.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In January 2007, 26,900 people throughout the whole of Northern Ireland  claimed unemployment-related benefits, and 4% of those, or one in 25, can be  found in Strabane.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I accept that we cannot neglect and look away from the  central areas when we focus on rural areas. Over the years, I have become a major  opponent to complete centralisation, and I  have said so publicly. Some months ago, one of our daily newspapers  officially declared County   Tyrone as the most  disadvantaged of the Six Counties, with  people there suffering the greatest amount of deprivation. However, there are different reasons why complete centralisation is wrong, and why we must  have some degree of decentralisation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">One reason is the family. Many people in my area drive to Belfast, and some of my  constituents work here in Stormont. They do not see their families and homes at  all in the winter, as it is dark when they leave and dark when they return.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Moreover, there are  health concerns, with the additional stress of a journey of up to  two-and-a-half hours &mdash; depending on the traffic &mdash; resulting in a five-hour  round trip each day. Those people have young families and they have to work. It  does not just apply to men; women too travel distances to work. They want to be  with their children and bring them up, but they cannot do so because of the  amount of time spent travelling.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are environmental reasons. If I drive down the  motorway at the wrong time, it is packed full of cars. We are becoming more and  more environmentally green and aware, and we must consider the volume of  traffic that packs our motorways.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Then there is the social aspect. People do not work near  their homes, and, therefore, they cannot get on with their business in the  evening. They cannot attend meetings or do  the things that they would otherwise do.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On a human and personal  level, there are many reasons to  consider decentralisation. I have become aware of the problem, not only  through my political involvement, but because of my job as a GP. GPs are asked  to write letters for all sorts of reasons. Doctors have to confirm everything  in writing nowadays. I have written letters on many occasions to try to bring  people nearer home where they can do exactly the same job. In this  technologically modern era, in which people are more aware of computers, jobs  can be done equally well close to home, and that should happen. People should  not have to travel down the motorway to Belfast.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">No one says that work should be removed from our cities and  urban areas. However, in the 21 years that I have lived out west, it has been  loss, loss, and further loss. More and more people are disadvantaged and  unhappy, and their health suffers because they spend most of their working day  travelling.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank my colleague in West Tyrone for tabling the motion,  which I support. I am delighted to see that the Minister is still in the  Chamber, and I am interested to hear his comments.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: I call the Minister for Regional Development, Mr Peter  Robinson.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr P Robinson)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, you and I have had  a long day today. This must be the ninth or tenth speech that I have made in  the Assembly in the last two days.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I congratulate Mr  McElduff on securing the Adjourn&shy;ment debate. I admire his generosity in  seeking to have public-sector jobs fairly and equitably allocated across Northern Ireland.  I refer to his generosity because, if one looks at the figures that officials  have gathered on the location of public-sector jobs, the Omagh travel-to-work area is ahead of the pack. In fact, by  travel-to-work area, Omagh has the highest ratio of public-sector posts for each 100 economically active people,  which is more than any other  travel-to-work area in the Province.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It might be useful if I outline some of those figures, although I may be seen as trying to wind up the  Member for West Tyrone. Another part of his constituency, the Strabane  travel-to-work area, is the worst in Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Ballymena travel to work area, which is presumably  where the Member wants to share some of the jobs to have a more equitable  dispersion with the Omagh travel-to-work area, has 19&middot;5 posts per 100 economically active people, Belfast has 32&middot;5,  Coleraine 22&middot;7, Craigavon 27, Londonderry 31&middot;1, Dungannon 23&middot;1,  Enniskillen 22&middot;2, mid-Ulster 18&middot;7, Newry 24&middot;3, Omagh 38&middot;1; but Strabane has 17.  The Member might want to join Omagh and Strabane together.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  What about Belfast?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  The figure for Belfast  is 32&middot;5; it comes second just after the  Omagh travel-to-work area.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The combined figures for Omagh and Strabane come fairly  close to the Northern Ireland average of 24&middot;4, which shows that, statistically,  the issue can be looked at in many different ways. It is not simply a matter of  spreading jobs evenly across Northern    Ireland, and in his contribution Dr Deeny  rightly drew attention to some of the difficulties in doing that, as did Mr  Declan O&rsquo;Loan.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The fact is that, on a location basis, the picture is  fairly complex. I have asked staff in my Department to provide me with more  data, which I will be happy to share &mdash; at least with the Committee for Finance  and Personnel &mdash; when it has been compiled. One moment the talk is about  public-sector jobs, and the next about Civil Service ones: Civil Service jobs  are public-sector jobs, but there are public-sector jobs that are not Civil  Service jobs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The decisions on the future location of public sector jobs  could have important implications for communities throughout Northern Ireland.  Ultimately, decisions will have to be taken about the location of any new  bodies that might be created as a result of the review of public administration, and that was mentioned in an  earlier contribution. The Department of Finance and Personnel also needs to  think longer term and beyond the RPA.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore I regard the work being lead by my Department in  developing a framework to support future decision-making as vital. The draft  guiding principles that would underpin those decisions were the subject of a  public consultation that closed at the end of April. The consultation attracted  strong interest, with 39 written responses in total, including one from Mr  McElduff &mdash; who is not a johnny-come-lately to this subject &mdash; which he followed  up with an Assembly question, which he has  already referred to. Mr McElduff commented  on the choice of venues for the consultation; however, I do not have to  defend that decision as it was taken before my time in the Department.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, I believe that the Department of Finance and  Personnel was keen to reach as wide an audience as possible and to give people the opportunity to discuss the matter face to face. As part of the  consultation it held two open workshops in Armagh  and Templepatrick, which attracted more than 70 delegates, including several  from Omagh. Unfortunately, DFP officials had to cancel the workshop scheduled  for Limavady on 12 April due to a low take-up.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The locations of the workshop were selected with the aim of  offering a range of options to delegates from across Northern Ireland. Obviously, it was  not possible to hold a workshop in every key town; as you know, Mr Deputy  Speaker, when you attempt to call a party meeting somewhere in the Province, 17  constituencies are unhappy with the choice of location you make.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Officials are currently analysing responses, and I expect the work of consultation to be completed  shortly. However, as one might  expect, one of the key themes that has  emerged so far is that of dispersal. Not surprisingly, a significant  number of respondents, mostly from west of  the Bann, argued that a proactive policy of dispersing public-sector  jobs from Belfast  should be adopted by the Executive. Equally  unsurprising is the fact that other respondents, mostly from the greater  Belfast area, acknowledge that while a well-managed relocation policy could  bring a more even spread of benefits of public-sector  employment opportunities across Northern Ireland, they also emphasise  the critical relationship between the long-term success of Belfast and that of  Northern Ireland plc., and they point specifically to areas of continued deprivation  in Belfast.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The full analysis and summary of the consultation responses will be completed shortly. Thereafter, I  intend to take a paper to the Executive to be considered in July. Since  the findings of the consultation process on the guiding principles for the  location of public-sector jobs in Northern Ireland are not yet  finalised, I am restricted in what I can say at this moment and in this Place.  However, there are advantages in providing work in areas outside Belfast, rather than requiring staff who live in those  areas to travel to Belfast  to work. I recognise the strong point that Dr Deeny made in drawing attention  to the environmental and road congestion issues. I have been looking at such  data as has been compiled in order to study trends and identify the areas from  which public-sector workers travel.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Let me be clear: I am not unsympathetic to having more  public-sector jobs located outside the greater Belfast area, but we should not ignore the  capital city as a key location. I thank Mr McElduff for initiating the debate,  and I await the outcome of the Executive&rsquo;s discussions with interest.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I thank the Minister, and I hope he will continue to be Minister  for Personnel and Finance for a long time to come. No doubt Hansard will correct  my earlier mistake.</p>
