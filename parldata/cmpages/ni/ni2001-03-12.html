                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have received notice from the Minister of
                Agriculture and Rural Development that she wishes to make a
                statement on the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Agriculture and Rural
                Development (Ms Rodgers):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a result of new information that became
                available over the weekend, I have adjusted my statement. The
                revised statement will be available in the Business Office.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful for this opportunity to update
                Members on the foot-and-mouth disease situation as it has
                developed over the past week. Since making my last statement on
                this subject there have been no futher outbreaks of
                foot-and-mouth disease in Northern Ireland. My efforts have been
                devoted to ensuring that that remains the case and to discussing
                with the industry how we can deal with the practical issues
                which flow from the present situation. As time goes on, we can
                be increasingly hopeful that we have been able to nip what could
                have been a major disaster for the agri-food industry — north
                and south of the border — in the bud.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The process has required enormous effort on
                the part of Department of Agriculture and Rural Development
                staff. We have slaughtered and incinerated some 2,500 cattle,
                sheep, pigs and goats that were in contact with infection. We
                have been manning the checks at the points of entry to and exit
                from the 1km zone around the outbreak area — 24 hours a day
                — for almost two weeks. The helpline which I established on 21
                February to deal with queries had, by last Tuesday, handled over
                12,500 enquiries, including over 3,000 on one day alone. This
                has been a huge operation by any standards, and I want to take
                this opportunity to place on record my appreciation of the
                efforts of all the staff concerned over the past few days.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am acutely aware, of course, of the
                enormous impact that the outbreak has had on farmers, the public
                and the agri-food industry in Northern Ireland. My officials and
                I have been meeting with all sectors at regular intervals,
                collectively or individually as appropriate, to hear at first
                hand about the practical impact of the disease and the effects
                that our controls have had on it, and to see how we can help.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My officials have also been having regular
                meetings with the RUC and the Army to keep them up to date with
                the situation, to explore how our controls are working on the
                ground and to sort out any difficulties. Contrary to what has
                been portrayed by some sections of the media, I have no
                difficulty at all in seeking and obtaining RUC and Army
                assistance where I thought it was needed, and they have duly
                provided it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The foot-and-mouth disease situation in GB is
                much less happy, and there are as yet no signs that the
                outbreaks there have been contained. The contrasting situations
                there and here vindicate my decision on 21 February to ban
                imports from GB of the relevant livestock and products. I know
                that that decision has caused problems for various parts of the
                industry and, indeed, the public. However, this is a price which
                simply has to be paid to protect us from foot-and-mouth disease.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So far as the Republic of Ireland is
                concerned, I met with Joe Walsh TD last Wednesday to compare our
                respective situations. The Irish Minister for Agriculture, Food
                and Rural Development and his officials were able to assure me
                that, while they have a number of herds restricted on a
                precautionary basis, foot-and-mouth disease has not been found
                in the Republic. The situation remains that there is no
                justification for controls on imports of animals or produce from
                the Republic over and above those that have already been imposed
                at EU level.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As time has moved on, the emphasis of our
                work has shifted away from containment and eradication to other
                issues. After the outbreak in County Armagh, it was necessary
                for the Department to follow up all instances where animals had
                moved to Northern Ireland and had been traded illegally. That we
                have now done, and the papers have been passed to the RUC so
                that the necessary actions can be taken against those
                responsible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At this point I need to depart slightly from
                the wording of the printed version of my statement, which went
                to Members on Friday, to take account of the latest information
                I have received over the weekend. There are now anecdotal
                reports that the consignment of sheep which came from GB and
                which led to our single outbreak in Armagh may — and I stress
                the word &quot;may&quot; — have been larger than we had been
                led to believe.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My staff are presently working with the
                various police forces to get to the bottom of this, but we are
                receiving little co-operation from those who are under
                suspicion, which makes the task much more difficult. Until our
                enquiries into this new information are complete, I am unable to
                state categorically that all the potentially infected animals
                have been traced and accounted for. This matter is being pursued
                with the utmost urgency, and I will update Members as soon as I
                can. I want to emphasise that we need as much information as
                possible, and I appeal to anyone who has any information to let
                me or the Department have it immediately.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Understandably, people’s minds are now
                turning to the financial aspects of this outbreak. In broad
                terms, current Government policy is that compensation is paid
                only for anything the Government require to be destroyed —
                whether animals or, for example, feed. My Department is
                processing the compensation claims we have received, and payment
                will issue shortly. We are, as Members would expect, looking at
                all those claims to ensure that those responsible for the
                illegal trading which was at the root of this outbreak do not
                benefit further from it. We are also arranging to pay out as
                soon as possible as many subsidy payments as we can in order to
                help farmers’ immediate cash-flow situations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will have noted from what I have said
                that there is no provision for compensation for consequential
                losses.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While I realise that many businesses are
                losing substantial amounts of money as a result of the foot-andmouth
                disease crisis, the financial implications for Government of
                compensating for those losses is potentially enormous.
                Nevertheless, I know that Ministers in Great Britain will be
                under pressure to pay compensation for such losses, and
                obviously I will be stressing that any change in policy in that
                area will have to apply in Northern Ireland too.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the present controls begin to bite, we are
                all becoming aware of the practical problems that they cause and
                I am increasingly being asked to make exceptions in relation to
                particular situations and activities. The fundamental principle
                under which I have been working, and will continue to work, is
                that my prime objective is to prevent any further foot-and-mouth
                disease outbreaks in Northern Ireland and to ensure that should
                the virus still be present somewhere in Northern Ireland, its
                spread will be limited. So, while I will, of course, look at
                particular problems thrown up by our controls, I am simply not
                prepared to agree to any relaxation which may undermine that
                prime objective.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Looking to the future, it is imperative that
                all of us continue to exercise the utmost vigilance against the
                threat of foot-and-mouth disease. As the days go by with no
                fresh outbreaks here, there will be an understandable temptation
                to drop our guard. However, with such a major disease outbreak
                on our doorstep, that must not happen, and I urge everyone,
                whether involved in the agri-food industry or not, to adhere to
                the guidelines issued last week by the Executive Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I would like to pay tribute again to
                our hard-pressed farmers and to the wider agri-food industry for
                their continued fortitude in the face of this crisis, and to
                assure them that I will continue to do everything that I can to
                help.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Madam Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remind Members that we have one hour for
                questions to the Minister and that they should be questions
                rather than statements.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Agriculture and
                Rural Development Committee (Mr Savage):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate the Minister on all the steps
                that she has taken, and pay tribute to all her staff. I know
                that we are going through a very difficult time. One of the main
                issues, which we cannot get away from, is that yesterday in
                Great Britain was one of the biggest days for outbreaks since
                this foot-and-mouth crisis began. This emphasises a point raised
                in the Minister’s statement this morning — that we cannot
                afford to drop our guard. I hope that people will bear that in
                mind. Again — to quote the Minister — it can be short-term
                pain for long-term gain. I read a press statement in the paper
                at the weekend —</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Madam Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can we get to the question.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Savage:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will come to my question; I am building up
                to it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the statement there were comments made
                that those responsible for this outbreak in the very first place
                would be immune from prosecution if they were to come forward
                with information. I was surprised to read that in the press. I
                urge the Minister not to go in that direction.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I too have read those reports in the paper. I
                assure Mr Savage that my departmental fraud investigation unit,
                the veterinary service enforcement unit and the serious crime
                squad of the RUC are meeting again this morning to take forward
                the issue of investigations into the individuals concerned.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dallat:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister has our full support in the
                restrictions she has imposed. However, looking to the medium or
                long term, the Minister will be aware that many social, sporting
                and cultural organisations have cancelled or postponed events
                because of the crisis. Can she give any indication when she
                believes the controls can be relaxed?</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.45 am</p>
                </i><b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand the concern that is out there.
                Before I answer the question, I want to pay tribute to the many
                sporting organisations such as the Gaelic Athletic Association
                and those involving soccer and rugby and, indeed, other event
                organisers who have so willingly co-operated in a situation that
                makes life very difficult, not only for those participating in
                the sports but also from the commercial interest point of view.
                I do appreciate that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is extremely difficult — even more so
                when one has people who are still not co-operating — to be
                sure of when this crisis will end. As soon as my veterinary
                advice tells me that there is a possibility of relaxing the
                controls in any way, I will review the situation. However, given
                the additional information that I received over the weekend,
                there is absolutely no question of relaxing the controls at the
                moment and I want to make that clear. Whenever it is possible,
                be it in a week or so, we will review the situation with a view,
                possibly, to making some adjustments to the present
                restrictions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the east-west trade, however,
                and given the situation in Great Britain, it will be a fairly
                long time before we can afford to make any adjustment to the
                present restrictions on trade between Great Britain and Northern
                Ireland.</p>
                <b>

                for bringing this additional information to our attention. I
                note that the papers are with the RUC. I hope that prosecution
                will be swift, certain and severe and that an example will be
                made of the reprobates who did this to the industry in Northern
                Ireland. I trust that the Minister agrees.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the additional information
                that the Minister gave us this morning, I have two questions. If
                the beasts have not all been traced, can she give the House an
                idea of how many of them are unaccounted for? Have the Republic
                of Ireland Government confirmed to the Minister how many have
                been slaughtered in its jurisdiction and sold on to France as
                Irish lamb?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Turning to the issue of compensation, has the
                Minister been able to calculate the loss to the Northern Ireland
                tourist industry and the agri-food sector? Does she agree, and
                can she give a commitment to the House, that now is the time to
                put together a special case for widespread compensation in order
                to assist the entire sector in Northern Ireland that has been
                affected by this terrible disease?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr Paisley for his questions. There
                seemed to be not two but rather three or four. However, I will
                try to deal with them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, there are possibly 60 animals that are
                unaccounted for, but, given the manner in which these illegally
                traded animals have been moved about, it is impossible to be
                absolutely certain of the number. It is not clear whether they
                are here or in the Republic. To the best of my knowledge, there
                have been 4,500 animals slaughtered in the Republic to date as a
                precaution.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to animals’ being slaughtered
                in the Republic and sold on, the Member is aware that under the
                current EU regulation, processing plants are not required to
                designate the country of origin or the country of slaughter on
                their produce; they merely have to give details on where it was
                processed. That will be a matter for the Republic. I do not want
                to comment on that, but it is perfectly legitimate to have
                animals processed in another state and then have them exported
                elsewhere as produce of a particular processing plant.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The loss to the tourist industry is not a
                matter that comes within my remit; it falls to the Department of
                Enterprise, Trade and Investment, as the Member will know. I
                cannot, at this stage, give the Member any such figures, but I
                do understand the real difficulties being faced by the tourist
                industry and empathise with it. The sooner these people are
                brought before the courts and prosecuted and the Department gets
                all the information it needs, the sooner normal trading and
                business will be resumed in the industry. However, there will
                still be problems for the tourist industry, given the situation
                in Great Britain.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Member knows, farmers will receive
                100% compensation for each animal. The slaughter premium that
                they will lose will be added to the market value.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley’s question is also concerned
                with cash flow difficulties. The Department of Agriculture and
                Rural Development is doing everything possible to ensure that
                farmers are receiving cash as quickly as possible via subsidies
                in other areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Consequential compensation is a matter for
                decision at national level. My monthly ministerial meeting with
                Nick Brown and the other regional Ministers will take place next
                Wednesday, and I have already asked Mr Brown to put
                consequential compensation on the agenda.</p>

                I welcome the Minister’s statement. Last year I wrote to her
                Department about the practice of spreading blood from
                slaughtering plants on to farmland. At that time I had grave
                concerns about the implications of that for the spread of
                diseases, particularly BSE. However, given the rapid spread of
                foot-and-mouth disease, can the Minister say whether that
                practice is still going on in Fermanagh and South Tyrone and
                whether it will continue?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s statement, but I
                am sure that I am not the only Member who is concerned about the
                additional information that the Minister brought to the House
                this morning. I am sure that there is a unanimous feeling that
                there should be no immunity from prosecution for those people
                responsible for bringing foot-and-mouth disease to Northern
                Ireland. Does the Minister think that there should be a reward
                scheme for those people who may be in a position to provide
                tip-offs? Some people who work for dealers may be in a position
                to supply information that would benefit the police and the
                Minister’s officials in following up the issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the Agriculture Committee meeting last
                Friday, I asked Dr McCracken about the issue of permits for
                special movement of animals where welfare conditions required
                it. Dr McCracken highlighted the issue of dairy heifers coming
                close to calving. Will the Minister confirm that that is still
                an option, despite these further concerns? Obviously we will
                expect the Department to maintain the highest standards of
                scrutiny for any possible effect on the disease.</p>

                of their regular meetings with the RUC this morning in order to
                bring forward the investigations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Animals can only be moved for welfare reasons
                under licence authorised by the Department of Agriculture and

                appreciate your ruling, but an advertisement has been placed in
                the newspaper, with advice from the Assembly’s Executive for
                the public and other bodies to cancel events. Therefore it is
                right that the Minister should involve herself and give some

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope I do not incur the Deputy Speaker’s
                wrath with my question.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the statement, and I congratulate
                the Minister on what she has done so far. I am sure that she has
                had very little time to spend with her family. It must be the
                same for her officials also, due to the amount of work that they
                have put in.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have a serious question, which needs to be
                answered. I am totally confused about the way in which we are
                dealing with this matter. There are hundreds of people in this
                building today. Some have come from rural communities and others
                come from farming communities. My difficulty is in that we are
                telling people that they cannot go to events.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the weekend, Rangers and Celtic fans
                travelled to Scotland to watch football, and they mingled with
                people from the community there. Some of them will be back
                today. Manchester&nbsp;United’s match was called off. If it
                had not been called off people from both sides of the border
                would have travelled to the match. There would have been large
                numbers of people involved — not just a couple of hundred.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why have the Minister and others called for
                the cancellation of junior soccer and Irish League soccer,
                considering that one of the matches cancelled was between
                Cliftonville and Crusaders in north&nbsp;Belfast, which does not
                have a rural community? There are probably more people in the
                Chamber today than would attend that match.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr Hutchinson for his kind remarks
                and his consideration for the problems my family are going
                through. I will pass his comments on to my husband — it might
                go some way towards compensation. I assure the Member that he
                has not incurred my wrath, for his question is perfectly
                legitimate. I understand that there is confusion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive Committee have issued
                guidelines which people need to look at and apply to their own
                situation as individuals or as organisers of events. The
                guidelines were worked out on the basis of clear advice from the
                experts, who are the Chief Veterinary Officer and other
                veterinary officers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to events and public amenities,
                the guidelines state that events in urban areas, which do not
                involve large numbers of people travelling from England,
                Scotland or Wales, can go ahead. I am not aware that I have
                asked for any junior soccer to be postponed. It would be crazy
                not to go ahead with junior soccer in urban areas that involves
                only people from urban areas. However, it is understandable that
                large numbers of people should not travel from England, Scotland
                or Wales given the present situation across the water.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot ask Celtic, Rangers or my own team
                — Manchester United — to cancel their games, for many people
                across the water go to them, and that is their business. I am
                trying to protect the Northern&nbsp;Ireland industry. People who
                travel to those matches should look at the guidelines. For
                instance, if they are farmers abiding by the guidelines of
                fortress farms, in their own interests they should not travel to
                those matches. That is the first rule.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.00 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first line of defence is the farmer
                himself. Secondly, anyone in a rural community, or in touch with
                farming people, land or animals, should certainly not be
                travelling across the water at this time. I ask individuals to
                take responsibility for themselves. It is impossible to police
                every person. The guidelines are there and the implications of
                foot-and-mouth disease coming in to Northern Ireland have been
                spelt out. I am simply asking for continued public support.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If someone from north Belfast, the lower
                Shankill, west Belfast or another urban area is a supporter of
                either of those teams and is going across there and coming back
                here again, the risk is possibly not as great. It depends on
                whom they are in contact with when they are over there. It is
                impossible to legislate for everyone. In relation to large
                crowds coming to events over here, the guidelines clearly state
                that in urban areas, events which do not involve large numbers
                of people from England, Scotland or Wales should go ahead, but
                if they do involve such visitors, then cancellation should be
                considered.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for all that she has
                done over the past weeks on foot-and-mouth disease. I have some
                concerns. Can the Minister assure me and the House that she will
                encourage the United Kingdom Minister for Agriculture, Mr Nick
                Brown, and the Prime Minister to put measures in place that will
                ensure persons or traffic at ports are monitored, especially if
                they have been in contact with farmers on the UK mainland?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My biggest worry is that foot-and-mouth
                disease could be brought across to this Province on clothes or
                vehicles because of lack of precautions at the ports on the UK
                mainland. I do not think that precautions at the UK mainland
                ports are as stringent as those in our own country. When a
                person or vehicle from the UK mainland comes into Northern
                Ireland carrying foot-and-mouth disease, it is there, and you
                cannot send it back.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with the Member and share his
                concern. I will be reviewing, and possibly tightening further,
                the GB controls. I visited Larne last week to see for myself and
                was entirely satisfied by the enormous effort being put in by my
                staff and by the vet in charge there. Not only were the lorries
                there going through a very wet and squelchy disinfectant mat
                when they arrived; they were then being brought into the yard
                and sprayed with disinfectant. I saw that for myself.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have now ensured that mats have been
                placed on ships and boats, so that lorry drivers, in particular,
                who would otherwise simply drive off, have to go through the
                mats on the boat before they get into their lorries. That
                measure was not there before. Our measures are very strict and
                well adhered to, but I will be keeping them under review. It is
                an issue that I will be discussing next Wednesday at the
                ministerial meeting. As the situation in GB worsens, we have to
                keep our controls very tightly under review.</p>

                to this particular problem. I am sure that every Member is
                concerned that there may be some animals that have not been
                traced. We hope that that problem is resolved as quickly as
                possible. In view of her statement, will the Minister look at
                particular problems thrown up by the existing controls? Is she
                aware of that substantive economic sector in the agriculture
                community — horse-breeding? The studding of the mares must be
                carried out at this time of the year, within a particular time
                frame.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can she examine the controls and negotiate

                carefully controlled licensing of movement between mares and
                stud farms can be facilitated thus allowing the industry to
                survive the season? If this cannot be achieved within the next
                couple of weeks then the breeding season will be cancelled until
                next year.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is a very relevant question because
                specific problems are being faced by the equine industry at the
                moment. Horses are not susceptible to the disease, but they can
                be carriers. I assure Mr McGrady that my chief agricultural
                officer had a productive meeting with equine industry
                representatives at the end of last week. Some adjustments to the
                controls have been made and, as a result, the industry has
                expressed satisfaction with the current position. Mares can be
                brought in to foal, and, in welfare situations — where they
                cannot be treated on the premises — horses can be brought to
                the vet under licence. At the moment, all animal movement is
                permitted only under strict licence.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How does the Minister expect the co-
                operation of farmers to restrict the spread of foot-and- mouth
                disease when Greenmount Agricultural College was spreading
                cattle slurry on land at a rented farm last Thursday? I am sure
                the Minister is aware that the spread of foot-and-mouth disease
                is a risk, but so is the spread of brucellosis — and I believe
                that Greenmount has had an outbreak of this disease. Has the
                Minister and her chief veterinary officer considered the risk in
                spreading animal slurry? What steps can be taken to prevent it
                in the future?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister consider that there may be
                an opportunity to reduce the number of cattle being transported
                across the Province by suspending the over-30-month cull until
                the end of the incubation period? These animals are being
                slaughtered at Langford Processors, Largy Road, Crumlin. This
                transportation and slaughter is not necessary, and it is putting
                neighbouring farms at risk. Can the Minister give this House
                constructive advice on the issue?</p>

                essential in order to keep the food chain going. It is carried
                out on the basis of cattle going straight from farm to
                slaughterhouse in order to minimise risk. All over-30-month
                scheme cattle are going direct to slaughter and not through the
                marts. The old practice of collecting cattle from different

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Such remarks are unfortunate at a time of
                crisis for such an important industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the issues that we must face when
                holding events is that of public confidence. We need to protect
                our industry, and we need to ensure that there is a
                proportionate response and not an overreaction. As the
                guidelines spell out, there will be events in urban areas that
                can go ahead with minimal risk. I can only appeal to the public
                and to those holding events to look at the guidelines, apply
                them to their own situation and take whatever action they feel
                is responsible and necessary.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first line of defence against this
                disease lies with the farmer. Therefore people in rural
                communities, and particularly on farms, must not go to any such
                event in case they bring back infection. They must take
                responsibility for the availability of disinfectant and so forth
                as they go in and out of their farms. The &quot;fortress
                farmer&quot; attitude is important.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will not comment on other remarks made by
                other people, except to say that in relation to this crisis I
                have had full co-operation from Minister Walsh in the Republic
                and I am entirely satisfied that that co-operation has been
                working well. Minister Walsh is on record as saying that we have
                been in constant contact and that he is entirely satisfied with
                the co-operation. Both Departments have been in contact on an
                hourly basis, and sometimes on a half-hourly basis —
                particularly my Chief Veterinary Officer, Dr Bob McCracken, and
                the chief vet in the South. There is entire satisfaction that
                everything is being done to keep foot-and-mouth disease off the
                island of Ireland.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note with concern the Minister’s
                additional remarks regarding some untraced sheep. I thank her
                for bringing that matter promptly to the attention of the House.
                It is clear why she cannot be completely specific about this. I
                note the Minister’s assertion that she will not be relaxing
                controls for as long as she deems that there is a risk to
                justify them. I assure her of my full support in taking that
                stand. I trust that she will err consistently on the side of
                caution until we reach the end of this episode.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further to the points raised by Billy
                Hutchinson and Billy Armstrong, I refer again to the vexed
                question of travel to and from Scotland. Surely the Minister has
                noted, as we all have, the severe clustering of cases of
                foot-and- mouth in the Scottish border counties. Unfortunately,
                these are absolutely adjacent to the main arterial routes that
                both cars and lorries travel up and down to get to Northern
                Ireland. There is an inconsistency and vagueness as to how real
                we think the threat is of infection being picked up by people
                travelling in that way.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand the restrictions in relation to
                those who have been on farms, but can the Minister assure the
                House that everything is being done to ensure that infection is
                not being brought in completely innocently by other people
                travelling through those areas?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is impossible for me to say that I am
                completely confident of anything, given the situation I face and
                the amount of illegal trading that has gone on. This is a real
                concern, and we will look at how we can tighten our controls
                where necessary.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I take this opportunity to appeal to people
                who are travelling and who have been on or near farmland or in
                infected areas. If they have any doubt at all as to whether
                there is a risk, I appeal to them to own up on their return and
                to be disinfected at the port or airport to make sure that they
                are not carrying the disease.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is virtually impossible to police
                everyone. We will continue to keep everything under review, and
                everything possible is being done at the moment, but we do need
                the co-operation of the public. People must recognise how
                important it is. There would be no problem if everyone were to
                take responsibility for his or her own behaviour, but I cannot
                categorically assure the House that every person will do that.
                All I can do is appeal to people to be responsible and to look
                at the guidelines. The clusters in Scotland are clearly a
                constant source of worry. A television programme a few nights
                ago showed the routes taken by trucks and the areas of
                infection. We can just do our best.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The news that over 60 animals, which came
                from the infected area in England, are circulating somewhere in
                the Irish Republic or in Northern Ireland is alarming. Will the
                Minister assure us that she is encouraging the RUC to arrest and
                charge the people responsible for not co-operating with the
                Ministry of Agriculture on this issue? Furthermore, will she use
                this experience to clamp down on the illegal smuggling ring that
                has existed for many years — particularly in south Armagh —
                and take herd books from those farmers who take many thousands
                of animals into their herds each year? Those animals seem to go
                nowhere else. They seem to die on those farms, when in reality
                they go south of the border.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister also act against those
                cattle dealers who buy calves in marts but have no permits to
                take them elsewhere? It is quite clear that those animals are
                being smuggled. Further to that, will she consider taking a case
                to the Agriculture Minister in England to get compensation for
                the livestock markets? Their business has been completely
                stopped, and they have had no income for the last three weeks.
                Will she support a reduction in their rates?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr Poots for his five or six
                questions. In relation to his first few questions, I find it
                rather strange to be asked if I will encourage the RUC to arrest
                those responsible. My officials have been meeting — and,
                indeed, are meeting today — with the RUC and the Department’s
                fraud unit and veterinary investigation units. They are taking
                the investigation forward, and I imagine that they are taking it
                forward for no other reason than to seek the arrest and
                conviction of those responsible. I sincerely hope that they
                succeed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots talked about clamping down on
                illegal smuggling and acting against cattle dealers. These are
                matters that arise from the present situation, and clearly they
                will be looked at in the post-mortem of the foot- and-mouth
                disease outbreak. My concentration and my whole focus is to
                ensure that the policy objective of keeping Northern Ireland
                free of foot-and-mouth disease, with the exception of the one
                case that we have, is achieved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the numbers of missing cattle,
                the figure could be up to 60, but, given the lack of

                on the agenda for the ministerial meeting next week. I am aware
                of the problem, but it will be dealt with at national level.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When I met with the auctioneers last week,
                the issue of rates being paid by the marts was mentioned to me,
                and I raised this at the interdepartmental meeting of officials,
                which I chair. Following that meeting the matter has been passed

                I welcome the Minister’s statement and particularly the fact
                that the door has not been completely closed on compensation for
                consequential losses. An obvious example of this is a case where
                a dairy herd may be slaughtered, and the farmer will receive
                compensation for the livestock but not for the loss of milk
                products for a number of months. Rural tourism projects in the
                restricted zone in South Armagh area have been hit very hard due
                to events having been cancelled, and this has resulted in
                financial loss. If the Minister does not receive sufficient
                flexibility in order to make available compensation for
                consequential losses, can she at least ensure that next year,
                when her Department is considering grant aid to these projects,

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At this point I am not prepared to make any
                commitment about what might happen next year. I understand the
                difficulties that people are facing, and I sympathise with them.
                I am aware of the cash-flow situation in the farming community,
                and I would like to inform Mr Murphy that I have taken all
                necessary steps to alleviate it. Payments of the less favoured
                area allowances are starting to go out today — and 90% will be
                paid by the end of March. I have asked my officials to
                prioritise that so that money is getting into the farmers’
                pockets as soon as possible. The balance of the sheep annual
                premium is being paid in March — this may extend into April
                — but it is being expedited. The first tranche of the sheep
                agri-money payment will be made before the end of March, and the
                balance of the sheep special premium will start to be paid at
                the beginning of April.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have tried to do everything possible to
                ensure that subsidies will flow quickly. I cannot, at this
                point, make any commitments about what will happen in the
                future. Clearly, there will be sympathy in the Assembly and in
                the Executive for the industry’s plight. There will, I hope,
                be some flexibility when I come to the Minister of Finance and
                Personnel to look for additional money.</p>

                there? Does she agree that the proof that sheep movements into
                the Republic of Ireland are associated with this foot-and-mouth
                outbreak demonstrates the clear need for the Republic of Ireland

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, the illegal movement of sheep and
                the lack of co-operation have created a huge problem for animal
                health and, particularly, as we have seen, the spread of
                foot-and-mouth disease. I discussed all of these matters last

                efforts. I share other Members’ anxiety about the addition to

                animals from the controversial consignment may have — and I
                appreciate that she emphasised the word &quot;may&quot; —
                slipped through the net. How can the farming community help her

                However, I say to the farming community that it is essential
                that we get to the bottom of this matter. The entire industry
                will be aware of the implications of the possible existence of
                irregularly or illegally traded animals, particularly sheep,
                with which the infection seems to have started. I appeal to
                anyone in the farming community, the rural community or anywhere
                else in Northern Ireland to pass on any scrap of information
                which might help the investigations to me, to my Department or

                provisions and recommendations on disinfectant precautions to
                roads on, for example, the Ards Peninsula? Some of the farmers
                in that area have told me that they would be happy if very
                strict restrictions were imposed to control any possible
                outbreak of the disease. At the moment, we are fortunate not to
                be affected.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is the Minister’s advice to those
                farmers who are bringing their cattle and sheep off the hills
                for winter grazing or moving them close to their farms? What is
                the correct method of bringing livestock closer to home?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to Mr Shannon’s queries about
                restrictions on the roads, it would simply not be possible for
                my officials to do this. They are already over-stretched. I
                visited the Newry office last week, and I was very impressed by
                the enormous burden of work that those people have been doing
                since this thing broke out two weeks ago. Some of them have been
                working around the clock to try to deal with one outbreak. It
                would be simply impossible to put restrictions on roads just as
                a precaution.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must reiterate the need for a fortress farm
                approach. All farmers, in the Ards Peninsula and elsewhere, need
                to be aware that they are the first front line of defence. They
                need to guard their farms and take all necessary precautions.
                The Ulster Farmers’ Union has emphasised that this is the best
                way of ensuring that they remain free of the disease.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In answer to the question about sheep, I am
                aware that there are problems — particularly with bringing
                ewes down for lambing, and it is the lambing season. Indeed, I
                met one farmer last week going into the Newry office who had a
                real problem getting his sheep down for lambing. I am keeping
                this under review, and I will be guided by the advice of the
                Chief Veterinary Officer at all times.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Movement of sheep would be very risky at this
                time. I am not yet in a position to say whether it will become
                possible to make some adjustment under very strict supervision.
                I am examining all options and if there is a possibility of any
                easement on the advice of the Chief Veterinary Officer, I will
                be prepared to move. However, given the information I have put
                before the House today, I am extremely reluctant to do anything
                that might endanger the industry. I know that ewes can lamb on a
                hill when bedding and straw are put down. It is more difficult,
                and there is a slight risk of losing the lambs, but I have to
                balance those risks. Which is the greater — the risk of
                spreading foot-and-mouth disease or the risk of losing one or
                two lambs? I am aware of the huge inconvenience.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to thank the Minister for the
                work she and her officials have done and for her report to the
                House today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The additional information supplied today
                deepens my concern on one count. The Minister has referred to
                the fortress farm approach to help to restrict the possible
                spread of foot-and-mouth disease. The Minister has also referred
                to the safeguards put in place at the ports. In the interests of
                the fortress Ulster approach, I urge her to be aware of the back
                door.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We do not know where these 60 animals have
                disappeared to. The Minister will also be aware of the theory
                — perhaps anecdotal, perhaps factual — that BSE in the
                Republic may have been curtailed by the JCB. If that continues
                to be the case in the Republic, and if there is foot-and-mouth
                disease there which we are not aware of, would the Minister not
                consider it circumspect for us to check the borders in the same
                way that the Irish Republic is checking the border?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I have already said, there is no sign of
                foot-and- mouth disease in the Republic and the resource
                implications of closing the border would be enormous at a time
                when our resources are focused on the essential task of keeping
                foot-and-mouth disease out of the North. The most important area
                to patrol is the point of entry from GB, where the disease is

                weeks have been particularly tough in County Armagh, and when
                the going gets tough, the tough get going, and we very much
                appreciate the tough way in which the Minister has approached
                this problem. We also appreciate how well she understands the
                problems of the farming community in south Armagh that are over
                and above the problems of the farming community throughout
                Northern Ireland. When we get through this crisis, will the
                Minister look at those farms in County Armagh in particular,
                taking measures to ensure that depleted flocks and herds are
                replenished, and will she also consider how lost markets can be
                restored? Will she put in place financial counselling to rebuild
                lost farm businesses and take such measures as are needed to
                alleviate the emerging problems in relation to collateral and
                credit with financial institutions?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr Fee for his remarks and for his
                questions. I empathise with what he has said about how the
                farmers in south Armagh are suffering. I have spoken to some
                farmers who have lost their herds, and I know the trauma they
                are suffering. I fully understand that many people will need
                counselling, and I am considering ways in which farm families
                can be supported.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will look sympathetically at all the
                consequences, and there will be immediate compensation for the
                loss of animals. Any consequentials will have to be looked at at
                a national level, and I will raise this issue at the ministerial
                meeting in London next Wednesday. I cannot go further at this
                stage, except to say that I sympathise with the farmers.
                However, my current focus is on eradicating and eliminating the
                disease.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gibson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, in view of the 60 untraced animals and
                the fact that an RUC agriculture fraud squad is virtually having
                to be established, does the Minister not accept that this calls
                into question the traceability which was much hailed in recent
                months?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, I thank the Minister for arranging
                compensation payments because a west Tyrone lobby has come to me
                saying that cash-flow problems are strangling the agriculture
                industry. Will the Minister move quickly, because farmers are in
                a desperate situation?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, on behalf of the consumer as well as
                the distressed farmer, why has the cost to the farmer gone up by
                only three pence per kilo over the past month. From an original
                high of 172p he is now facing a reduction, whereas, I am told,
                butchers have faced an increase of 12p? Is there evidence of a
                meat cartel using foot-and-mouth disease to increase its
                profits?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem with untraced animals is not the
                traceability system; rather, it is that some people have been
                trading illegally. We will have to look at that and tighten it
                up. Some people have been acting outside the law, trading
                illegally and flouting the law.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for recognising the
                measures that I have taken to deal with cash-flow problems. Last
                week I also had meetings with the grain trade and the banks. I
                had a very sympathetic hearing and was assured that they are
                aware of the cash-flow problems that the agri- food industry and
                farmers in particular are experiencing. They are prepared to be
                flexible and will not come down hard on people with real
                cash-flow problems at present.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the consumer and the prices
                being charged, I have no evidence of a cartel, and if there were
                one I would be very concerned about it. That would be a matter
                for the Office of Fair Trading. I have met with the General
                Consumer Council for Northern Ireland this week to hear its
                concerns. I would be extremely concerned if the price of meat
                was rising at a time when the price of animals was falling. That
                is a commercial issue that I could not get involved with, but it
                would be an indication of what could be called an unfair
                exploitation of farmers at a time when they are in real
                difficulty.</p>

                area of County Armagh have to travel to Newry to collect their
                post, and in some cases disinfectant matting is not in place.
                Can the Minister assure me that there is close liaison with Post

                it is fortress Ireland at the moment, so I do not have a problem

                points of order during questions on ministerial statements. We
                seem to have at last achieved consistency, and questions are not
                taken during questions to Ministers. However, I understood that
                the Speaker ruled in September that points of order would not be
                taken during the hour allocated for questions to a Minister on a
                statement, but would be taken at the end of the period. There
                seems to have been serial recidivism on the matter since. I ask

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following nomination by the First Minister
                and the Deputy First Minister, Mr Mark Durkan and I attended the
                meeting, which I chaired. The Irish Government were represented
                by Mr Noel Dempsey, the Minister for the Environment and Local
                Government. This statement has been agreed by Mr Durkan and is
                also made on his behalf.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The meeting began by reviewing progress on
                the current environmental work programme. The Council noted
                progress by the Environment and Heritage Service and the
                Environmental Protection Agency in developing a joint register
                of environmental research projects. The agencies are in the
                process of tendering for a joint contract to develop a web site
                of current environmental research. Access to this information
                will help researchers to avoid duplication of effort and to
                identify topics for research and possible funding sources.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The working group on water quality reported
                on the two areas that it was tasked to take forward — namely,
                water quality strategies for the Erne and Foyle catchment areas
                and the implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Alan Barr of Kirk McClure Morton made a
                short presentation on the main findings and recommendations of
                the review of the Erne and Foyle catchment management
                strategies. Copies of the report have been placed in the
                Assembly Library.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council also approved the publication of
                a report — ‘New Technologies for Monitoring’ — which was
                prepared jointly by the two environmental agencies. This report
                has been placed on the agencies’ web sites, and copies have
                been deposited in the Assembly Library.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the second environment sectoral meeting
                the Council agreed that co-operation on new technologies for
                monitoring should concentrate initially on water quality
                monitoring. In view of the importance of water quality
                monitoring for the implementation of the EU Water Framework
                Directive, the Council decided at the Belle Isle meeting that
                this work should be taken forward by the working group on water
                quality as part of its work on the implementation of the
                Directive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council noted the progress being made by
                the two environmental agencies in developing databases of
                environmental information. Ministers agreed that initial work
                should concentrate on cataloguing the information held by both
                jurisdictions. Decisions will then be taken on how best to
                provide Internet access to the data.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council agreed that the two Environment
                Departments should conduct a joint study into a number of the
                most significant impacts of agriculture on the environment. The
                terms of reference of the study include: assessment of the use
                of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilisers; consideration of good
                farming practices and relevant controls both North and South;
                and assessment of the cross-border movement of slurries and
                spent mushroom compost. A steering group including
                representatives of the relevant Agriculture Departments will
                take the work forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council then turned its attention to
                cross-border waste management. Ministers agreed that officials
                should begin work on identifying options to encourage the
                expansion of waste recycling in Ireland. In particular, it was
                agreed that a joint approach to developing uses and markets for
                secondary materials and recyclates would be of mutual benefit.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ministers also noted the arrangements for
                taking forward the issues raised by Assembly Members, following
                my first report to the Assembly on 11 September 2000. Pollution
                of the Erne system and the spread of zebra mussels will be
                studied by the water quality working group in the context of its
                work on the implementation of the Water Framework Directive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Investigating problems of disposing spent
                mushroom compost will form part of the study on the
                environmental impacts of agriculture. Primary responsibility for
                transposing the Major Accident Hazards Directive in the South
                rests with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment
                rather than with Minister Dempsey’s Department. It is not,
                therefore, a matter for the environment sectoral group.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, the Council considered and agreed
                the text of a joint communiqué that was issued after the
                meeting. A copy of that communiqué has been placed in the
                Assembly Library. The Council agreed that the next sectoral
                meeting on the environment will take place in June in the South.</p>

                there are adequate measures in place to protect our waterways,
                and that there are sufficient fines to deter polluters?</p>

                report on new technologies for monitoring have been placed in
                the Assembly Library. The report is also available on the
                websites of the two environmental agencies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report concluded that there are
                well-established methodologies for monitoring emissions to air
                and water and for measuring air quality. The report stated that
                co-operation should initially concentrate on monitoring water
                quality. The initial work in that area will focus on three main
                issues; the chemical and biological monitoring of surface
                waters, and the assessment of fish stocks.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our interest in fish stocks is purely as an
                indicator of environment quality — any work will be undertaken
                in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture and Rural
                Development and the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure as
                appropriate. Where there are other issues, these will be
                followed up.</p>

                the management of water quality throughout such a district on
                both sides of the border.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland’s three main waterways are
                the Erne, the Foyle and the Lough Neagh systems. They form part
                of catchments with the South. The group has made good progress
                in two areas: the Erne and the Foyle water quality strategies.
                Kirk McClure Morton, consulting engineers, were commissioned to
                review the Erne and Foyle catchment management strategies. They
                presented the main findings of the report at the meeting at
                Belle Isle.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Significant water quality management advances
                have been made since the original strategies for Lough Erne and
                Lough Foyle were completed in 1997–98. However, there are
                important new areas of work to be done to meet the water
                framework directive requirements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The working group has begun to plan for the

                Relevant officials from both jurisdictions and their
                counterparts in Great Britain will have to liaise on technical
                matters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The occurrence of zebra mussels outside their
                natural habitat is a problem in many parts of Europe and north
                America. They first appeared in the Erne system in 1996. They
                probably spread to Ireland on the hulls of boats that entered
                the River Shannon and then to the Erne system by the pleasure
                craft.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main thrust of my Department’s spring
                publicity campaign will be to educate the public abaout the
                mussel problem. It will be aimed particularly at boat owners,
                anglers and those who engage in watersports. We need their help
                to stop the spread of the mussels to waters that are not yet
                affected. The campaign will alert those groups to the danger of

                CORINE map records information to a minimum of five hectares.
                The UK land cover map is more detailed and records information
                every one hectare. Northern Ireland is included in the more
                detailed UK land cover 2000 map.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a European requirement that Northern
                Ireland also be part of the CORINE land cover map. There should
                be no additional costs to Northern Ireland. The cost of
                converting the UK land cover map to CORINE will be shared by the
                UK and European Environmental Agency. The obvious benefit of a
                joint land cover map is that land types will be classified in
                the same way in the North and in the South. It will be essential
                to have similar information in the North and the South when
                characterising shared river basin districts for the water
                framework directive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are working on other databases, and the
                first step in the integration of key environmental databases
                will be to catalogue the information held by both jurisdictions.
                Full integration of data may not be necessary — the catalogue
                itself may be sufficient.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People will have Internet access to the
                information in both jursidictions. It is too soon to estimate
                the cost of developing a catalogue of environmental information.
                However, both environmental agencies had already begun the
                process for their own purposes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Progress is slowly being made towards
                integration, which is not expected significantly to increase the
                costs.</p>

                research register was placed in newspapers both North and South
                on 22 February 2001. Access to the register will be through the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This question is very important and the issue
                is one that has been referred to many times. The Member is
                referring to pollution incidents where there has been Crown
                immunity. If we were to introduce an independent agency, we

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are advantages and disadvantages. I
                assure the Member that any Government agency that pollutes the
                water will certainly be exposed. We do that rather pedantically.
                Sewage treatment is the responsibility of the Department for
                Regional Development; it is not within my remit. Regarding
                pollution, we will certainly go after the polluter, whoever he
                may be, and we will enforce the issues when they come before us
                and where it is possible to do so.</p>

                water quality and new technologies for monitoring. I look

                announcement about the cross-border waste study, it is somewhat
                vague and general. The study is very important, and I want to
                know when it will begin. How urgently is this matter being
                addressed, and how long will it take? Will the Minister
                undertake to review the current waste management strategy in the

                made on implementing the waste management strategy since its
                publication in March 2000. My Department will make £3·5
                million available to help councils implement the strategy, which
                requires district councils to submit their waste management
                plans to my Department by June 2001. District councils have
                formed three waste management planning groups to meet this
                requirement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further planned work includes: establishing a
                new advisory board, which will comprise 15 members, including a
                chairman, to assist my Department implement the strategy; the
                issue of planning policy guidance on planning and waste
                management; the introduction of regulations to place a duty of
                care on anyone handling controlled waste to ensure that it is
                managed properly and recovered or disposed of safely; and the
                introduction of a waste management licensing scheme to control
                the operation of waste disposal sites. The progress may be slow
                but we are working on it and movement has been made.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A study is beginning straight away, and I

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s statement. With
                regard to the study on the expansion of waste recycling, what
                involvement will there be of private sector bodies, which seem
                to be playing the major part in recycling and on which we will
                be depending if we are to meet the targets now being set?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards the study on the impact of
                agriculture on the environment, this is not exactly the best
                timing for such a study. Moreover, it is couched in terms such
                as &quot;consideration of good farming practices&quot; and
                &quot;relevant controls&quot;, as opposed to perhaps
                &quot;consideration of the encouragement of good farming
                practices&quot;. Would it not be better to encourage farmers, by
                grant aid, to move towards better practices — especially in
                the face of the current crisis of BSE and foot-and mouth disease
                — rather than suggest further controls, to add to their
                problems?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member has referred to the waste
                management strategy. It has set a target for district councils
                to recycle 15% of household waste by 2005. This will entail a
                significant increase in the current level of recycling with
                district councils, estimated to be around 5%. I am pleased to
                state that my Department will provide, as I have said, £3·5
                million to help councils to implement the strategy. This can
                include assistance with recycling and the development of targets
                for recycling.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With reference to the farming issues, one
                takes into consideration the great difficulties farmers have at
                this time. However, agriculture is a major contributor to the
                economy of both Northern Ireland and the Republic, of which we
                are all very much aware. I fully appreciate the dire
                circumstances that the agriculture industry finds itself in at
                present, particularly with the current foot-and-mouth emergency.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nevertheless, we have to take a longer-term
                view and recognise the impact that agriculture activities have
                on the environment. The greatest problem is the run-off of
                nutrients to lakes and rivers, leading to excessive growth of
                algae and plants. This can cause oxygen levels to fall, which is
                the most serious water-quality problem affecting waterways on
                both sides of the border.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At Belle Isle, Ministers agreed that a joint
                study should be carried out into a number of the most
                significant impacts of agriculture on the environment. The study
                will involve representation of both Agriculture Departments. It
                will assess the use of fertiliser application rates, identify
                good farming practices and relevant controls, and assess
                cross-border movement of slurries and spent mushroom compost.
                Data from private bodies will come in through the Waste Advisory
                Board, which will be appointed very shortly.</p>

                The waste management strategy deals with the management of
                controlled wastes, which includes household, commercial and
                industrial wastes. Agricultural, mining and quarrying wastes are
                not included. However, the EU Waste Framework Directive requires
                that controls will be extended eventually to agricultural
                wastes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Department and the Department of
                Agriculture and Rural Development will be working together to
                bring such wastes within the control regime and to develop an
                agricultural waste strategy. The aim is to incorporate within
                this the waste management strategy at its first review in 2002.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So far as the cross-border issue of spent
                mushroom compost is concerned, the mushroom industry is
                concentrated in the border counties of Armagh, Tyrone, Monaghan
                and Cavan. Spent mushroom compost (SMC) has become a major
                environmental problem in those areas. In Monaghan, around 60% of
                SMC is dumped, only 10% is composted, and 30% is land spread. If
                the compost were to be imported into Northern Ireland for
                disposal, the district council would need to be satisfied that
                environmentally sound disposal methods were not realistically
                available in the country of origin.</p>

                district councils by June 2001 and will include proposals for
                achieving the recycling targets. Cross-border co-operation will
                provide the economies of scale necessary to make investment in
                recycling and recovery facilities viable. Northern Ireland is
                not large enough in itself, so there will be co-operation as far
                as that is concerned. We will look at it on an all-island basis.
                As I have already emphasised, that will also provide a larger
                market for products made from recycled material. That is a big

                zebra mussel. He used the term &quot;pollution of the Erne

                Has any effective study been done? Has anything been done to see
                what its effect is on fishing? Does it usurp and take the food
                of the fish, or is it an excellent means of clearing the water?
                Furthermore, what has been done to prevent the spread of this

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The zebra mussels at first seem as if they
                are clearing the water, but they do a lot of damage to it. I am
                not aware of any full investigations having being done. I
                understand that the Department of Agriculture is undertaking a
                major study of the zebra mussel issue because, as I said
                earlier, it is a very big issue that has really been imported.
                It looks as if the emphasis needs to be on prevention rather
                than cure because, as I understand it, whenever one has the
                problem, it is very difficult to get rid of it. Therefore
                prevention is an important issue. That is why I emphasised that
                boats and equipment can be cleansed by steam-cleaning the hulls.
                We depend very much on the people who move boats and equipment
                in waterways to ensure that they steam clean. The emphasis must
                be on prevention rather than cure.</p>

                group of councils in the north-west is of a cross-border nature
                and, from the point of view of my council in Strabane, we have

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Foster:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The waste management strategy allows for
                cross-border co-operation as part of the district council waste
                management plans. Any cross-border co-operation needs to comply
                with the waste management strategy and the United Kingdom
                management plan for exports and imports of waste. The United
                Kingdom plan is currently under review. It is likely to allow
                cross-border imports and exports of waste where there are sound
                economic and environmental reasons for such activity and so long
                as the activity is included in the district councils’ waste
                management plan.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The waste management strategy encourages
                groups of councils to draw up joint waste management plans to
                achieve economies of scale. Everything that is done will be
                controlled. The strategy will be watched closely, and control
                will be exercised on all cross-border activity. The North and
                South are co-operating so much, because waste management is a
                big issue — almost too big for Northern Ireland to deal with
                on its own. It is good that we, as two separate jurisdictions
                living in a neighbourly fashion, can work together on this big

                We have 15 years in which to achieve the good water quality
                specified in the Directive. It will take some time for us to get
                there, and undoubtedly the money is a problem. That is why there
                is a cross-border study. Northern Ireland is not big enough to
                tackle waste management on its own. The Department of the
                Environment wants to encourage people to recycle and make them

                present. This is a difficult issue which is going to be bigger
                than Northern&nbsp;Ireland can deal with on its own. It is
                worthwhile for the two different jurisdictions that border on
                one another to work hand in hand for the mutual benefit of all

                immediately implemented the relevant EU&nbsp;Directive, whereas
                the Republic of Ireland sought, and got, a derogation. That

                sub- regional implementation of waste management strategy. The
                Environment Committee was given that information in a recent
                presentation by a key official from the Department. Is there,

              seriously its responsibilites under the terms of the Good Friday
              Agreement. A new division was set up to take this agenda forward
              because of the need to recognise the importance of this area and
              to take a joined-up and integrated approach to the Department’s
              responsibilities in the areas of equality, rights and social
              inclusion. A considerable amount of work still has to be done
              following the approval of the equality scheme, and that will be
              overseen by this new division.</p>

              whether in respect of school buildings, the pupil/teacher ratio,
              access to teaching aids, and so forth — be administered?</p>

              the negotiations leading up to the Good Friday Agreement. Flowing
              from the Good Friday Agreement is a responsbility — not just in
              my Department, but in each one of them — to ensure that people
              are treated with equality, dignity and respect. As Minister of
              Education I pledge to ensure that this will happen, and I think
              that the creation of this division shows how much importance I
              place on the issue. It is vital that every child be treated
              equally.</p>

              However, it is vital to educate children about drug and alcohol

              children have to make their own choices. However, it is our duty
              and our responsibility as the people in charge of education to
              ensure that the full range of information is put before young
              people. The issues of alcohol abuse and drug abuse are important
              to the community, to parents, to educationalists and to children.
              Despite all the other pressures, it is important that we move

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It certainly can be tackled through the

              Educationalists have a vital role in preparing young people for
              the future. In 1996 my Department issued guidance to schools in
              the form of a resource pack entitled ‘Misuse of Drugs’. This
              included vital information about alcohol misuse. In addition,
              under the Northern Ireland drugs strategy, approximately £800,000
              was allocated to the education sector in March 2000 to enable
              provision in schools and the youth service to be strengthened. As
              a result of that, each of the five education and library boards
              have appointed two full-time officers to address the development
              of drug education programmes, including education about alcohol.
              With regard to details of expenditure, it is not possible to

              out there in the real world either during the day or on a nightly
              basis can see that there is huge alcohol abuse taking place. This
              is to the detriment not only of young people but also of the local

              meet the cost of increases in examination fees which will result.
              These funds will be allocated to schools shortly. Schools will
              also be able to draw on their share of the general £14·7 million
              addition made to schools’ delegated budgets for this year, as

              in examination fees arising from pupils being encouraged to take
              at least four AS levels in lower sixth, and because they will now
              have to pay exam fees for each module rather than one fee for the
              final exam. That is why I have made the extra £220,000 available
              to help meet these costs. In relation to the specifics of how much

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Only arrangements that will improve our
              education system, by enhancing choice, equality, accessibility and
              excellence, will be implemented. The review body has asked for an
              extension of the original May 2001 deadline to October 2001. This
              is in light of the huge response to the public consultation
              process and the wealth of oral and written material which has been
              submitted for consideration. The Education Committee has not yet
              finalised its submission. It, and other educational interests
              groups, have also requested a longer period for consideration of
              this complex issue. It is vital for the future of our children,
              and for our economy and society, that we develop the best possible
              arrangements for post-primary education here. If a little more
              time is needed to achieve this, it will be time well spent.
              Therefore I agreed to an extension for completion of the review
              body’s report to the end of October 2001.</p>

              is undertaking what is an incredibly important review of
              post-primary education. It has been involved in extensive work:
              about 25 public meetings, more than 1,000 written submissions —
              which most people will agree is enormous — and a website that
              has had approximately a quarter of a million hits. That shows
              there is an incredible interest in what is probably the most
              important education debate that we have seen in many years.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With respect to what all of this will do for

              we appreciate and understand the incredible good work that has
              been done in our education system. What we are trying to do is

              it remains to be seen how we can move forward and whether or not
              we can put in place a process, mechanisms and procedures that will
              further enhance and strengthen our education system. The
              benchmarks are all there to show our position at the moment —
              the latest 11-plus results, for example. People will be interested
              to see whether we can enhance our education system and benchmark
              it to show whether it is an improvement on the previous one. We
              cannot pre-empt the outcome of the review. I am as interested and
              as keen as anyone else to see this completed as a matter of
              urgency.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The way in which all political parties and
              educationalists have approached the issue since the review body
              was set up has been incredibly encouraging to everybody working in
              what is a very important area for young people, their parents and
              our society as a whole. I pay tribute to the parties in this
              Assembly that have moved forward in a positive and constructive
              way. We must keep up that approach. We must keep moving forward
              and ensure that the review body is aware that we are all behind
              it. When decisions have to be taken at the end of this process, I
              hope that they will be taken in consultation with this Assembly,

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Equality&quot; is the key word, and I
              certainly support our moving forward on a basis on which all our
              children are treated equally. I cannot pre-empt the outcome of the
              review body’s very important deliberations. Anyone who has
              observed the review body’s management of this cannot fail to be
              impressed by the incredible amount of work that it has done and
              has still to do over the coming period. I am as anxious as anyone
              to see the outcome. It will be my duty to take possession of the
              report and to manage the forward movement as expeditiously as
              possible. When I came to this position I made it clear on the very
              first day that the foundation stones of the Administration would
              be equality, excellence, choice and accessibility. If we stick by
              those guiding principles, it will be possible for us all to move
              forward with an education system that can truly value all our
              children equally.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should continually review our approach to
              these situations. We need to put the difficulties experienced into
              perspective. A total of 594 pupils were unable to attend for
              examinations because of the adverse weather conditions.
              Supplementary tests have been arranged by the CCEA for the A level

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is concern that some pupils will be
              disadvantaged, but that will not be the case, in my opinion.
              However, I do agree that we should continually review our approach
              to these situations. The Member has raised a very important issue
              in relation to the agricultural crisis and the effects the
              foot-and-mouth disease outbreak is having and might continue to
              have over the coming period. We should all learn lessons from the
              experience and do whatever we can to ensure that in the future we
              will overcome the hurdles that are, on occasion, placed before us.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The wearing of a school uniform is not governed
              by legislation and is a matter for individual schools to determine
              in line with their internal organisation and management. However,
              education and library boards may provide or contribute towards the
              cost of clothing for pupils in post-primary and special schools
              whose parents are in receipt of income support or income-based
              jobseeker’s allowance. The clothing allowances scheme is
              intended not to cover the full cost of school uniforms but to

              children with incidentals to their education — for example,
              items such as pens and pencils or articles of sports equipment,
              which will remain the property of the pupil.</p>

              door of such schools to children from low-income families who may
              have qualified for places in those schools? Has the Minister
              sought advice from the equality unit in the Office of the First

              in this regard?</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is vitally important that no school should
              impose extravagant charges on any child which make it difficult or
              even prohibitive for that child to attend the school. We should
              approach this matter in consultation with the schools and the
              school authorities. It is an issue that we should be concerned
              about. The vast majority of schools behave very responsibly. The
              importance of the issue lies in the difficulties that it can
              present in some circumstances. We must establish where it is a
              problem. If people can identify where the problem is, the best
              solution will be to move forward in consultation with the school
              to ensure that no child, parent or family is put under pressure in
              an unacceptable way.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before seeking advice from the Equality
              Commission, the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First
              Minister or anyone else, we should establish whether this is a
              real problem. If it is a problem, then we can consider going down

              others for the benefit of the school or in support of any school
              activity. However, schools must make it clear that there is no
              obligation to contribute and that pupils will not be treated
              differently depending on whether their parents have made a
              contribution in response to the request.</p>

              statutory walking distance of their home. I have no plans at

              finance the child’s transport to the Irish-medium secondary
              school in Belfast. That is the sort of anomaly that inaction on

              In relation to the current transport arrangements, everybody knows
              that education and library boards are required to make such
              arrangements as they consider necessary or as directed by the
              Department to facilitate the attendance of pupils at grant-aided
              schools. The current arrangements, which were introduced in 1997,
              enable transport to be provided where pupils have been unable to
              gain a place at a suitable school within statutory walking
              distance of their home. Therefore, in the context of transport
              arrangements, the term &quot;suitable school&quot; has a precise

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I expect the review group on acute hospitals to
              report to me in the spring. Since it was established last
              September, the group has been listening to the views of local
              communities, health and social services interests and many others.
              It would not be appropriate for me to comment on the future
              provision of acute services in any area until I have had the
              opportunity to study the group’s report.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To date, no specific rural proofing criteria
              for all Government policies have been drawn up, but any future
              decision on acute hospital services will take rural considerations
              fully into account. Any decision taken as a result of the review
              will be in line with the principles of targeting social need and
              will be subject to an equality impact assessment.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The absence of rural proofing criteria will
              disappoint many who live in rural parts of the North of Ireland.
              However, in their absence, will the Minister outline her current
              plans to ensure the delivery of acute services in Fermanagh and
              South Tyrone, which has the most dispersed rural community in the
              North of Ireland? Many constituents live 45&nbsp;minutes’
              journey from the nearest hospital, and some live even further
              away.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many constituents are of the opinion that one
              of its hospitals has had its services whittled away as a result of
              a policy of &quot;death by 1,000 cuts&quot;. Will the Minister
              outline her Department’s plans to ensure that the provision of
              future acute services will be fair to everyone?</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the issue of fairness, I made it clear in my
              substantive answer that all decisions will be subject to a full
              equality impact assessment. Obviously, access to acute hospital
              services is a matter of crucial interest to rural communities.
              Therefore I have asked the review group to give particular
              consideration to this matter. I expect that the report from the
              review group will focus, in particular, on rural areas. In
              addition, any change proposed in the report will need to be
              considered in the context of new targeting social need policies
              and will be subject to an equality impact assessment.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bearing in mind that we were all assured, when
              the Assembly was suspended, that George&nbsp;Howarth was about to
              issue the result of his review, will the Minister indicate when
              she expects to have this report? What is causing the delay? Is the
              Department being run by various colleges rather than by the
              Minister?</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, the Member will know that I did not ask
              for suspension. That came from a different side of the House.
              Having taken on such an onerous portfolio, I certainly did not
              seek four&nbsp;months of suspension in the middle of this. The
              Member will also know that the review of acute hospitals was
              announced following the end of suspension and therefore was not
              affected by that. I have reiterated this time and time again: the
              whole idea is that we are in a new situation with a new network of
              institutions, and people expect to have their views taken on
              board.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I set up the review group to ensure that people
              in rural and other areas had a chance to make their views known
              and to give a strategic overview of the services which will be
              needed in the future. I expect it will report to me in the spring.
              Such reviews take time. On the one hand there is a need to get
              this complex issue right, and the review group has gone out to
              public meetings in order to do this. Also, the group has sadly
              suffered from the loss of one of its very highly respected
              members, and that will have an impact on its work. The review
              group will set a strategic overview for us, and Members will
              recognise how crucial it will be for the future of our acute
              hospital services here.</p>

              into account the changes in provision of services in hospitals on
              the southern side of the border? For example, the removal of
              maternity services in the Louth Hospital will obviously have an
              impact on the people in north Louth using maternity services in
              Daisy Hill Hospital.</p>

              the group. It has been asked to examine access to hospital
              services, and it is very clear that this includes rural access. We
              know that that has been dealt with in its meetings in local areas,
              and I expect the report to give particular focus to rural issues
              and to highlight the matter.</p>

              Belvoir, the staff and the patients will not be made to suffer
              because of lack of funding. Some of my constituents have, on
              occasion, travelled to Belvoir, only to be told that the equipment

              the City Hospital was taken in 1998. That now looks extremely out
              of date. The latest evidence from Belvoir suggests that the
              equipment is on its last legs. Unlike Ms Armitage, I suggest that
              it is the Minister’s responsibility to find money to make that
              equipment fully serviceable. I welcome the £4 million that she is
              putting into the new cancer facility at the City Hospital, but is
              this just papering over the fact that the Department’s plans for
              combating cancer in Northern Ireland are in tatters?</p>
              <b>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member will know that he and I often have
              discussions about the tone in which he asks or ends his questions.
              However, I agree that I need to look, and I will look, at whatever
              needs to be done — whether that is the replacement of existing
              equipment or the provision of additional imaging or radiotherapy
              facilities — to ensure that cancer patients receive timely,
              high-quality care and treatment. It is clear from the Programme
              for Government, the budget allocations and the priorities for
              action that I have set out that the development of cancer services
              remains a high priority for my Department.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the issue of the decisions around the
              completion of the cancer centre, the Member should know that in
              1999 an outline business case was prepared on behalf of Belfast
              City Hospital Trust and was approved at a total estimated cost of
              £32 million. This envisaged the new cancer centre being
              operational from the end of 2003. The trust has recently indicated
              that, owing to significant and rapid developments in cancer
              services and new building requirements, the cost of the project
              may be considerably higher. My Department has therefore asked the
              trust — as I know the Member would expect it to do — to
              urgently revise its business case and to resubmit it for
              consideration. That process will inevitably cause some delay to
              the completion of the project.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I know that the Minister is concerned about the
              very serious situation in cancer services in Northern Ireland.
              Cancer cannot be treated until it is diagnosed. My question
              relates to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The Minister
              has heard me, on a number of occasions, talking about positron
              emission tomography. The most important thing at the moment is to
              do with MRI scanning, not just in Belfast City Hospital but in
              other parts of Northern Ireland. Can the Minister give me an
              answer on that?</p>

              imaging strategy that we are seeking to put forward at present.
              The idea of the extension of MRI scanning is a very major part of
              that. I will be able to come back to the Member, and to the
              Committee, shortly on the details of how we can proceed with that.
              Some of the bids that we have made will obviously have an impact
              on how quickly we proceed with some of our objectives.</p>

              up to two and a half years for MRI scans? A constituent of mine
              was told after six months that he would get an MRI scan but that
              it would be in 22 months’ time. Further to that, is the Minister
              aware that many people are having operations cancelled because
              there are not enough intensive care beds? Many people who have to
              receive thoracic surgery — in particular, to remove cancer —
              cannot have the operations because of the lack of intensive-care
              beds.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have recently taken action on the waiting
              list for MRI scans. In particular, a mobile unit was made
              available. I refer the Member to the announcement that I made
              about Altnagelvin. We have a strategy to put in place.
              Specifically, part of the priority of that will be to deal with
              the whole question of MRI, because we know that there are waiting
              lists there and that that does need improvement.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot comment on the specific cancelled
              operations that the Member mentioned — he would need to send me
              the details. However, I have said many times in this House that
              the capacity in our hospitals at present is not the capacity that
              is needed, due to years of underfunding of health and social
              services. I have asked, and will continue to press the case with,
              my Executive Colleagues to have further resources made available.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The ‘Priorities for Action’ document, which
              was issued on 9 March 2001, outlines my priorities for the coming
              year. The improvement of capacity, in order to ensure that people
              have access to hospital services and to deal with a continuing
              high level of demand and winter pressures, is one of those
              priorities.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As with all other busy hospitals, Craigavon
              Area Hospital does experience trolley waits when the demand for
              acute services is particularly high, so patients sometimes have to
              be cared for on trolleys overnight. However, the trust makes every
              effort to ensure that patients who are awaiting admission receive
              proper treatment and care and that the number of people waiting on
              trolleys is always kept to a minimum.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Southern Health and Social Services Board
              has been working with Craigavon area hospitals group and the
              Craigavon and Banbridge Community Health and Social Services Trust
              to deal with the problem. The measures include increasing the
              number of intensive care and high-dependency beds and enhancing
              community provision to take the pressure off Craigavon Area
              Hospital.</p>

              concern about the number of patients who have to wait for beds on
              trolleys. Does she agree that patients should not have to wait on
              a trolley overnight for a hospital bed? Can she secure additional
              finance to help Craigavon Area Hospital resolve this problem?</p>
              <b>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is absolutely unacceptable that even a
              minority of patients should have to remain on trolleys for
              unreasonably long periods of time. This year’s winter plans were
              supported by an investment of £15 million and involved a range of
              measures to speed up admissions and discharges from hospital. My
              priority has been, and remains, the provision of safe and
              effective services.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have made several bids this year for money to
              deal with some of the pressures on Craigavon Area Hospital,
              particularly the temporary transfer of services from South Tyrone
              Hospital, and money was put aside for that. I allocated £5·5
              million to address the financial consequences of the temporary
              closure of inpatient services at South Tyrone Hospital. That will
              cover the additional costs that are incurred by Craigavon Area
              Hospital.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nonetheless, Craigavon Area Hospital is one of
              the three hospitals that most frequently experience capacity
              problems at the moment. As I have said, one of my priorities for
              the coming year is to increase capacity to deal with the problem.
              For example, I have asked that the provision of intensive care and
              high-dependency beds, and other areas of hospital capacity, be
              examined. I have also asked that community care be considered as a
              means of relieving pressures on the hospital.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Finance and Personnel will
              answer questions next, so I will not even begin to answer the
              Member’s question about whether I can get the money to do this.
              However, I will continue to press my Executive Colleagues for
              increased funding to enable the Department of Health, Social
              Services and Public Safety to deal with these problems. Members
              will be aware that, within the Executive, there are competing
              priorities for resources.</p>

              underfunding by previous Governments.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">South Tyrone Hospital cannot provide overnight
              accommodation for patients because there is a lack of specialist

              elective day surgery at South Tyrone Hospital, and I have made it
              clear that I expect the chairpersons and chief executives of the

              but our hospitals are still affected by significant capacity

              look at the whole rating system and no issues are barred from
              being examined. One issue that we must address is the need to
              raise resources through some local taxation.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, the non-domestic revaluation exercise
              getting underway on 1 April — to update the last exercise
              carried out a number of years ago — will examine a number of
              issues, including the changes that have taken place since then in
              relation to retail geography, et cetera. Many people are making
              the case that the development of many out-of-town shopping centres
              in recent years has made a difference. Hopefully, the non-domestic

              of rating. The non-domestic revaluation exercise will decide, in
              valuation terms, how that burden should be distributed. We have to
              look at wider policy issues, including what particular sectors we
              want to protect or promote or what issues we want the rating
              system to particularly bear upon. The issues raised by the Member

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Lord Sharman’s review was carried out on
              behalf of the UK Government. It was independent of Government and
              represents his personal views following wide consultation with a
              variety of individuals and bodies. The UK Government will be
              considering the report and recommendations and will provide a

              be important to have a full and wide-ranging consultation process

              Government Resource and Accounts Bill by the Finance and Personnel
              Committee pre-empted, to some degree, the findings of Sharman?
              Despite opposition, the Committee was successful in getting
              changes to the Bill.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Also, does he agree that the implementation of
              the recommendations of the Sharman Report will create a degree of
              openness and scrutiny of Government accounts? Can he assure us
              that this will be the case with respect to future legislation?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are a number of points in that particular
              question. I believe we improved the Government Resources and
              Accounts Bill through consideration in Committees and in the
              Chamber. Nevertheless, I also believe that some of the proposed
              amendments raised issues that would be better and more competently
              pursued in future legislation. We have already indicated that the
              Audit Reorganisation Bill would be one area in which to take
              forward some of those issues.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now that we have the Sharman Report and
              recommendations, it is particularly important that we consider
              them properly. A number of false statements have been made in
              relation to Sharman, the legislation, and the attitudes to
              amendments that I had dealt with previously. The order making
              provision that Sharman recommended be used in the Government
              Resources and Accounts Act 2000 is in our Bill, which has now gone
              for Royal Assent.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Furthermore, we included the additional
              requirement on the Department of Finance and Personnel to have
              regard to any views of the Public Accounts Committee in relation
              to that order making provision. Quite a number of issues have been
              raised — more far-reaching than we could consider in the context
              of the Government Resources and Accounts Bill. The Executive, the
              relevant Committees and I are determined to fully consider those
              issues.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can the Minister assure the House that we will
              not follow slavishly that which is done in another place? Can he
              assure us that in applying the best parts of the Sharman Report we
              will be able to demonstrate our own autonomy, which is the
              interest of accountability for the people of Northern Ireland?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can assure the Member that it is precisely
              for that reason that we need to have our own consideration and our
              own wide-ranging consultation on the Sharman Report and on the
              other issues involved. There might be issues and ideas outside and
              beyond that report that, for our purposes, we want to take
              forward.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to remember that the original focus and
              thrust of the Sharman review was looking at things from the
              perspective of the UK Government. It did not look at issues at
              local government level, some of which, in our devolved context,
              fall to us, as opposed to the situation across the water. We need
              to come up with our own views and our own proposals. That is why I
              have argued that we should take the time to properly consider the
              Sharman Report and other aspects of these issues that might fall
              outside the ambit of the report.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the Bill that we recently passed in this
              House, we have already made provisions that go beyond those in the
              equivalent Whitehall legislation.</p>

              evaluating data sources supplied by Departments. A consultation
              version of the research findings will be made available in April,

              agreed with the European Commission and the Northern Ireland
              Departments to alleviate the difficulties facing those groups
              operating in areas of greatest disadvantage? Furthermore, can he
              inform us of the procedures to be followed by voluntary groups

              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That goes outside the immediate point about the
              Noble study. However, to make it clear, as I have recounted to the
              House before, in the current financial year we have made some £9
              million of gap funding available to cover a number of European
              programmes. Half of that is to cover the gap between Peace I and
              Peace II.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nevertheless, we recognise that the main issue
              of concern to people is the gap in funding that will apply in the
              next financial year. To that end, as I announced in this House on
              12 February, the Executive is now authorising Departments to go
              ahead and, on the basis of sound judgement, to make advanced
              allocations to projects that they believe would be eligible under
              Peace II. We have allocated a further £2 million to the Executive
              Programme fund on social inclusion and community regeneration,
              effectively as a safety net to cover Departments in case they make
              a bona fide allocation on that basis to a group that subsequently
              does not qualify for Peace II. That safety net provision is there,
              first to protect the respective departmental budgets, and secondly
              to protect the budget for the Peace programme overall.</p>

              he agree that it would be highly questionable, to say the least,
              to continue to rely on dated information such as the Robson index
              — or the International Fund for Ireland ward designation, which
              has been derived from it — when developing new TSN criteria?
              Furthermore, does he recognise the importance of being able to
              target pockets of deprivation, which might be neglected at ward
              level?</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with the thrust of most of the points
              raised by the Member. The Robson indices have served their purpose
              and run their course. That is why we are conducting this exercise
              at present. We want to make sure that we have new indicators of
              deprivation, both to take account of a wider range of domains of
              deprivation, because those are relevant to particular programmes,
              and, in aggregate terms, to give us a more reflective and
              broader-based measure of deprivation. It is also important that,
              as far as possible, we improve the assistance that such measures
              of deprivation can give us in targeting terms — and that means
              not just in helping to map the particular factors of deprivation,
              but also being able to locate concentrations of deprivation.</p>

              that the outcome will not be confined to information which is
              available only at ward level. I accept that there are pockets
              either within wards, or that straddle wards. Ward boundaries are
              not necessarily drawn in the most congruous way from an
              administrative or social point of view.</p>

              probe him further. He said that he has no policy in relation to
              meeting with councils, and yet he lists a number of meetings that
              he is going to have with them. Given the outcry that there has
              been about the increase in regional rates levels, certainly in so
              far as his original proposals were concerned, he will be aware, as
              a former councillor, that many local council representatives —
              from parties of all descriptions, his own included — have voiced
              grave concerns about the level of the increase.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Would it not be more sensible for the Minister

              level of rates, he should have a formal process of consultation
              with local councils? Can he also outline to the House what plans
              he has to ensure that when the rates bills come through people’s
              doors that they know to whom they should complain about a regional
              rate increase of more than double the rate of inflation — almost
              treble the rate of inflation — which is his responsibility?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have already pointed out in this Chamber and
              at the Finance and Personnel Committee that some time ago, I asked
              the Rate Collection Agency to ensure that on the rates bill, there
              is a much clearer and stronger differentiation between the
              regional rate and the district rate. It may be harder to do that
              satisfactorily this year, compared with future years, simply
              because of time factors and the question of the need for better
              information and technology — different software, essentially.
              However, we have already taken the decision in principle, and an
              instruction to sharpen up that differentiation has been given to
              the Rate Collection Agency. It is important that people understand
              the basis and composition of the rates bill that they are being
              asked to pay.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards the wider points, I said that it was
              in relation to future rating levels that I had no plans to discuss
              or deal with councils. I based that partly on the fact that, in
              the nature of our public expenditure planning and of the number of
              meetings that I have to undertake within Government, it would be
              hard for me now to promise and build in a satisfactory
              consultation phase with local government about future regional
              rate levels. It is more important for us to make sure that we have
              built in more prior consultation with the Assembly, and its
              Committees, in particular, for I know that that has been a point
              of criticism and concern here. We could, therefore, look after our
              responsibility for the regional rate in an open and transparent
              way, allowing councils to do the same in relation to their
              responsibility for the district rates.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker, with your permission I will
              take questions 5, 11 and 12 together.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Current policy is that all public procurement
              be based on value for money, having regard to propriety and
              regularity. Value for money is defined as the optimum combination
              of whole life cost and quality or fitness for purpose to meet the
              users’ requirements. The review of procurement was conducted
              prior to devolution and produced a number of recommendations which
              have considerable merit. However, more needs to be done to ensure
              that that important work is taken forward in the context of
              devolution and in a way that is consistent with the wider
              commitments in the Programme for Government.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An implementation team has been established to
              take forward the findings and recommendations of the initial
              review. The first meeting of the team took place on 19 February,
              and it will bring forward its proposals and take account of the
              equality dimension for consideration by the Executive Committee by
              June 2001.</p>
              <b>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for his statement and for
              clarifying the issue for me. Will he inform the House if the
              Government Purchasing Agency (GPA) was used in assessing the award
              of a purchase contract for the Northern Ireland Tourist Board to
              Baird’s printing company for the production of promotional and
              marketing materials? If the GPA was not used, why not? Will the
              Minister assure the House that it is Executive policy that all
              public service contracts are submitted to a process so that no
              conflicts of interests may arise now or in the future?</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The GPA was not used in the procurement
              transactions that were the subject of the Comptroller and Auditor
              General’s report. That decision was not made by the GPA or the
              Department of Finance and Personnel. Therefore I cannot comment or
              give details on it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Subsequent to the first draft of the
              Comptroller and Auditor General’s report, the Northern Ireland
              Tourist Board moved to a position where all its procurement will
              be conducted through the GPA.</p>

              Therefore the exercise can take account of those issues, and I

              can be used as a source of funding for areas of greatest need?

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I have said, the review was undertaken prior
              to devolution. It looked at public procurement in Northern
              Ireland, which is running at £1 billion a year.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That review said — on the basis of the
              savings being suggested for Whitehall — that we should be able
              to achieve savings of some £30 million. After further examination
              of this matter, we could achieve even greater savings. The main
              aim is not to quantify the possible savings, but to make sure that
              we have the means to guarantee that all possible savings are made.
              We should also maximise the value for money that we get from
              public procurement so that we do not overspend on items and
              services and so that we can, in turn, release that money into
              other hard-pressed areas of public spending.</p>

              public money is being spent on public services. The money spent on

              Northern Ireland Voluntary Trust and their management as
              intermediary funding bodies of Peace I. Nevertheless, I recognise
              the genuineness with which particular concerns are held on the
              degree to which money is being made available to a range of
              victims’ groups and specific victims’ interests. The Executive
              are trying to be sensitive to this, and in the arrangements made
              in Peace II in respect of victims that measure will be managed
              under the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First

              the draft Life Sentences (Northern Ireland) Order 2001 and report
              to the Assembly. The draft Order seeks to introduce new provisions
              for the sentencing, review and release of life-sentence prisoners
              and those in prison at the pleasure of the Secretary of State. It
              will establish a specific body of Life Sentence Review
              Commissioners and move to address the matter of compliance with
              the Human Rights Act 1998.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our first meeting was held on 29 January 2001.
              We met on four further occasions, all in public session. The
              Committee considered the draft Order and debated the purpose of
              and changes to the legislation. As a result of extremely tight
              deadlines the Committee decided to invite written evidence from
              seven organisations, as listed in the report. The Committee also
              invited the Secretary of State and senior Northern Ireland Office
              officials to give oral evidence on the background to the Order.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, owing to pre-existing diary
              commitments they were unable to accept the Committee’s

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Overall, the Committee received six written
              submissions and took oral evidence from the Northern Ireland Human
              Rights Commission, the Probation Board for Northern Ireland and
              Prof&nbsp;John&nbsp;Jackson from Queen’s University, Belfast.
              This provided a good spread and balance of evidence, considering
              the extremely tight deadline. All written submissions, minutes of
              evidence and minutes of proceedings are included in the report for
              completeness.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having heard oral evidence on 5 and
              6&nbsp;February the Committee carried out an article-by-article
              consideration of the draft Order on 12&nbsp;February. This also
              included consideration of the four schedules overall. A majority
              of the Committee welcomed the draft Order, as it attempts to bring
              the law on the release of life-sentence prisoners into line with
              the requirements of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).
              However, the Committee had a number of concerns, including the
              fact that the Secretary of State would retain certain powers,
              potential breaches of the ECHR, lack of clarification on all life
              prisoners recall and revocation of licence. The Committee made the
              following recommendations and comments in relation to the draft
              Order.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For article&nbsp;3, a statement should be
              included that the Commissioners are to be independent of
              Government. The appointment of commissioners should, as far as
              possible, be made through open competition.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;In discharging any functions under this
              Order the Commissioners shall have regard to —</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b) the Convention rights of life prisoners;</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(c) any representations made by or on behalf of
              a victim or a member of his/her family.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Convention rights&quot; and
              &quot;victim&quot; need to be defined.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For schedule 1, the Commissioners must have
              security of tenure to ensure their independence of Government, and
              provision should be made for a fixed-term appointment of
              five&nbsp;years. For article&nbsp;4, there should be a role for
              the commissioners in deciding what information should be disclosed
              to the prisoner. This would entail a process whereby the Secretary
              of State would refer to the commissioners for a decision on the
              extent to which certain information should be withheld from the
              prisoner.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For article&nbsp;5, new arrangements whereby
              courts will be required to fix the punishment part of a life
              sentence were welcomed. Political interference with the court’s
              power to sentence convicted offenders who were over&nbsp;18 when
              they committed their offence was questioned. The power of the
              Secretary of State to review the court sentence when the offender
              was under the age of 18 when the offence was committed was
              considered appropriate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For article 6, an amendment was recommended to
              exclude consideration of certain factors when deciding when to
              release a life prisoner. For article&nbsp;7, the Secretary of
              State should consult the commissioners in all compassionate
              release cases.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For article 8, there should be an amendment to
              allow the commissioners to review the licence at regular intervals
              and to give commissioners the power to annul a licence after a
              certain time has elapsed and where there have been no breaches of
              the licence conditions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For article 9, there should be an amendment of
              the wording of article 9(2) so that it reads</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Secretary of State may revoke the
              licence of any life prisoner and recall him to prison before a
              recommendation by the Commissioners is practicable where it
              appears to him to be necessary for the protection of the public
              from serious harm.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An amendment to article 9(4) should specify a
              timescale:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Secretary of State shall as soon as
              reasonably practicable refer the case of a life prisoner recalled
              under this article to the Commissioners.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On article 10, the power to specify the tariff
              or punishment part of the sentence of transferred life prisoners
              should be given to the court. In order to comply fully with
              article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, the
              determination of the tariff requires a hearing before a court.
              There should be a procedure whereby the Secretary of State refers
              the case of a transferred life prisoner to the court for the
              tariff to be determined.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On Article 11, as with article 10, the power to
              certify the part of the sentence which should be served before a
              prisoner is due to be considered for release should also be given
              to the court.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These recommendations are outlined in detail in
              the report, together with the Committee’s conclusions, which
              stress</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The need for the Secretary of State to
              enter into meaningful consultations with the relevant
              organisations before implementation.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee was set tight deadlines to
              complete its work, which militated against the provision of oral
              and written evidence from the Secretary of State, the Northern
              Ireland Office and to some extent the legal profession. That
              timely evidence would have helped us to produce a more fully
              informed report.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly is often put in the position of
              presenting complete reports or commentaries on pieces of
              legislation within tight deadlines, giving it little time to
              perform these functions adequately. A strong message should go
              from the Assembly to the Northern Ireland Office and the Secretary
              of State that Members should be given a reasonable time to react
              to proposals from the Government.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the members of the Committee for their
              assistance, their hard work and their contribution to the report.
              I also thank the various organisations for their written
              submissions and oral evidence, which were given short notice.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I thank the Assembly staff for their
              support.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I invite Members to support the motion.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr A Maginness:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr Savage for his chairmanship of the
              Committee and for the contribution he has made to the House. It
              was a comprehensive presentation on behalf of the Committee on
              this proposed draft legislation. I agree with the Chairperson
              about the time frame. All members of the Committee and, indeed,
              other Members of the House agreed that insufficient time was given
              for consideration of this draft legislation. The same was the case
              with the flags regulations, the financial services legislation and
              so forth.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under section 85(4)(c) of the Northern Ireland
              Act 1998, the period we are given is, in effect, 60 days. It
              should be emphasised to the Secretary of State that 60 days is not
              long enough and that the Act should be amended to extend the time
              period. The code of practice on written consultation issued by the
              Cabinet Office in November 2000 stipulated a period of 12 weeks,
              which compares unfavourably with the time allocated to the
              Assembly. Strong representations should be made not only by the
              Committee in its presentation to the House but also by you, Madam
              Deputy Speaker, to the Northern Ireland Office.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.15 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This has resulted in a very tight schedule for
              Members in the completion of their work, and it is unfair that we,
              as legislators, should be so pressurised, especially on such
              important legislation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The other effect is to impose an even more
              unfair burden upon outside organisations which are very dependent
              on voluntary contributions to their various internal and policy
              committees. We are therefore not getting the benefit of fuller
              presentations from those organisations. That is a further point
              for consideration by the Secretary of State.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moving to the substance of the report and of
              the draft legislation, the Committee has emphasised the need for
              the commissioners to be truly independent of Government. The
              Committee has made several suggestions in that regard. A constant
              theme in the Committee was that independence should not just be
              notional but that it should be firmly established. It was
              suggested, for example, that the commissioners’ terms of office
              should be for five years, which would guarantee their
              independence. Other provisions were also suggested.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Also, in that section of the report, the
              Committee suggested that representations should be made by victims
              or their families in relation to the decision-making process
              concerning releases. That is a very important matter which the
              House should bear in mind. Those who have suffered, or families
              which have suffered, as a result of the offences committed by the
              people with whom we are concerned today, should also be considered
              by the independent commission in the exercise of its functions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to schedule 2, a point was made
              regarding the disclosure of evidence and information to the
              commissioners but not to the prisoners. In the view of the Ad Hoc
              Committee, that creates problems. It was felt that that would be
              in contravention of article 6 of the European Convention on Human
              Rights. That is not just some sort of minor reservation. It is a
              very real reservation of the Committee, and it should be
              emphasised in the House that it is not right that such information
              and evidence should not be disclosed to a prisoner or his
              representative. To some extent the proposed legislation tries to
              meet that, in so far as the legislation indicates that a special
              advocate could be appointed by the commission to consider the
              evidence and information presented.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While that to some extent ameliorates the
              problems, it does not remedy in full the defect in this schedule.
              It would therefore be best if all evidence and all information
              were disclosed to the prisoner appearing before the commissioners.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are differences between evidence and
              information. Evidence is subject to various proofs and has been
              brought to the commissioners with weight and authority;
              information has not necessarily been tested. It is important
              therefore that all information and evidence is brought to the
              attention of the prisoner so that his legal representatives can
              deal with any problems as they arise. A prisoner must be in a
              position to rebut defective information or evidence.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under article 5, which is at the heart of the
              proposed legislation, a judge will fix the tariff. He or she will
              fix the punishment for retribution and deterrence. That is a
              crucial innovation because it will make our approach to sentencing
              compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. In no way
              will the sentencing of an individual depend on anything other than
              a court.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, a distinction is made for
              &quot;whole-life prisoners&quot; — prisoners who receive
              sentences that do not have fixed terms. When a person is under 18
              the Committee believes that it is appropriate for the Secretary of
              State to be able to say that that person can be referred to the
              commissioners. That is an important move by the Secretary of
              State.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ad Hoc Committee divided on prisoners who
              were over 18 when they committed the offence and received a
              whole-life tariff from the court. Although the Committee’s
              majority view was to accept the provision that the Secretary of
              State could act, some members objected in principle, saying that
              that allowed for political interference with the court’s power
              to sentence convicted offenders who were over 18 when they
              committed the offence. I agree with the majority view on this
              matter because I cannot envisage a situation in which a person
              should be sentenced to a whole-life tariff and suffer an
              indeterminate sentence for the rest of his or her life. In those
              circumstances someone has to intervene in order to review that
              sentence at an appropriate stage. There is no provision for a
              court to do so and the best possible alternative is for the
              Secretary of State to intervene or, if such matters are devolved,
              the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister. We should
              support the majority view of the Committee, which is to accept
              this provision. I know that that deviates from the concept of
              there not being any political interference in sentencing.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, for the reasons that I have just
              outlined, I believe that, in these circumstances, it is necessary
              for there to be an intervention, albeit from a political source. I
              believe that it is fair and just in all the circumstances. A
              better alternative would be for a court to review that, but there
              is no provision for that in this or any alternative legislation.
              In these circumstances, I support the majority view.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to article 8, it was the Committee’s
              view that the imposition of a licence or licence conditions on a
              prisoner for the rest of his life after release from prison was
              unduly harsh. I agree with that. There must be circumstances when
              a prisoner who has been released for a number of years should be
              given the opportunity of wiping the slate completely clean so that
              there is no longer anything hanging over him, and he can get on
              with the rest of his life. The stigma of having a life sentence
              would therefore be removed. Where a person has shown himself to be
              of good character and has rehabilitated himself, it is wrong and
              unjust that he continues to carry the stigma of a life prisoner. I
              believe that there should be some provision — and the Committee
              has accepted this — for the annulment of that licence. This
              would be of benefit to the released prisoner.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I know that this will probably not be accepted
              by the Secretary of State, although I hope that it is, for it is a
              very important message for the Assembly to send to the Secretary
              of State so that this stigma can be removed from released life
              prisoners at some time in the future. We should all support it. If
              the Secretary of State does not accept the terms of the present
              draft legislation, perhaps at some point in the future he will
              accept them in alternative legislation before Parliament.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I have points in relation to articles
              10 and 11. Article 10 deals with transferred prisoners, and
              article 11 deals with existing life prisoners. It was the view of
              the Ad Hoc Committee that these two provisions were incompatible
              with article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Again,
              we have the interference, as it were, of the Secretary of State.
              The Secretary of State has a sentencing function and can specify
              the remaining tariff that a prisoner has to serve. That is in
              relation to either an existing life prisoner or a prisoner who has
              been transferred, for example, from prison in England or Wales, or
              even from the Irish Republic. The Secretary of State should have
              no significant role in deciding the term or tariff that the
              prisoner will have to spend in prison. That function should be
              exercised by a court. I fully support that — I believe that the
              court should exercise such a function. The provision in the
              legislation before the House says that the Secretary of State
              should deal with the matter in consultation with the Lord Chief
              Justice.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.30 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I believe that that is insufficient to
              meet the terms of article 6 of the European Convention. It seems
              to be wrong in principle to allow that to happen. I support the
              Committee fully in its recommendation that a court is the
              appropriate body for dealing with this, notwithstanding the fact
              that the Lord Chief Justice would have some sort of role,
              according to the draft legislation before the House.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee did outstanding work in the time
              available, and its members worked very well together in a
              non-partisan fashion. It produced a consensual report that it can
              be proud of, and I believe that the House should give it the
              fullest support.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once again this House has demonstrated that it
              is able to put together a report under the difficult and, at
              times, perplexing circumstances in Northern Ireland. It allows
              Members to produce a report from which they can select á la
              carte, and which says, essentially, that we agree to disagree.
              That is a unique feature of this House. We did the same with the
              flags report. In that case none of the parties agreed with each
              other, but nonetheless we were able to produce a report. In this
              case, although the disagreement is on technical issues, we have
              been able to produce a report wherein we agree to disagree. We
              came up with a report that expresses and represents all the
              different points of view. That at least gives us the ability to
              come forward and suggest that we can support it, if the Secretary
              of State agrees to certain points.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On that basis, my party will be supporting the
              motion that was so ably presented this evening by the Chairperson
              of the Committee. I wish to add my congratulations to the staff of
              the Committee for the way in which business was conducted. We have
              produced a report, under difficult circumstances, which would not
              otherwise have been proposed or supported in this way.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report deals with a number of issues, and I
              would like to break them down into four areas. The first is the
              issue of consultation. Both of the Members who have spoken on this
              have indicated their disappointment and dissatisfaction with the
              way the consultation process operates. I have to add my voice to
              their concern. There is a recommendation in the report that
              reflects our concern about the lack of consultation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We asked the Secretary of State and officials
              from the Northern Ireland Office to make themselves available to
              consult with us, in a meaningful way, about many of the terms that
              have been introduced into this draft Order. As we see from the
              report, the Secretary of State had too many diary commitments, and
              officials from the Northern Ireland Office were too busy to
              attend. We must express our concern that neither the Northern
              Ireland Office nor the Secretary of State could make themselves
              available to discuss this very important issue, to give us their
              point of view and to answer questions. Many members of the
              Committee had questions and concerns about this proposed Order.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once again, the way that the Northern Ireland
              Office has handled this makes a mockery of the consultation. It
              should take that to heart. If it is going to take this House and
              its representatives seriously then it must consult with them
              seriously, instead of treating them in the off- hand way that it
              did during the course of the deliberations of this and other
              Committees.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Order raises an issue that divides us on
              fundamental grounds. That is the issue of whether or not the
              Secretary of State should have a role in the sentencing process.
              That was discussed at the Committee meetings.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My party is of the view that no politician
              should have a direct say in the sentencing of a prisoner. That is
              an issue for the court — the court should make a determination,
              and the sentence should be served unless it is overturned at
              appeal. This Order gives the Secretary of State a direct input
              into the sentencing of prisoners. I object strongly to that
              measure because I believe that it is open to abuse.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Politicians, by their very nature, are lobbied,
              and they can succumb to a lobby. On an issue of justice that
              should be arbitrated independently by the court, it is wrong that
              a politician should have that say. I have had some experience of
              that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was involved in a case, over 10 years ago,
              known as the &quot;UDR four&quot;. The mechanism that was then
              open to us was to lobby a politician. We had to provide him not
              only with evidential issues but with political reasons why he
              should reopen the case.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fortunately, as a result of an appeal relating
              to that case, that mechanism has changed. You have to go back
              through the courts, and an independent Criminal Cases Review
              Commission must come up with evidence and put forward a case that
              shows that there is sufficient evidence to warrant an appeal, as
              opposed to there being both evidential and political grounds for
              an appeal.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been a subtle change, but this Order
              allows for back-pedalling on that, which is wrong in principle and
              could be open to abuse. There have been a number of cases that
              have demonstrated in England and Wales — and, in principle,
              could demonstrate here — how this measure would operate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under article 5, for example, it is essential
              that those people who serve a whole-life tariff do actually serve
              that tariff. If you do the crime, then you must be able to serve
              the time. Although that is a cliché, any political interference
              with how a person serves that time should be restricted.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I believe that life should mean life. That is a
              view that raises the hackles of some people, but it is one to
              which my party holds firmly. We think that any attempt to
              undermine what life means, and what a court means when it
              sentences someone to life, should be resisted.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are three types of case where we can see
              that abuse could arise. There is what I would call the Hindley-
              type case, where, under article 5(4), a person can, through
              political lobbying, ask for his or her case to be looked at again.
              That should be avoided. The Criminal Cases Review Commission
              should be the only mechanism used, and on an evidential basis
              only.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then there are the Bulger-type cases. Those
              cases again indicate — even where juveniles and very young
              children are involved — that they can be open to political
              interference.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, under article 7, the Secretary of
              State may, at any time, release a life prisoner if he is convinced
              that there are exceptional circumstances. We could name that the
              &quot;Kray clause&quot; — the Home Secretary was convinced that,
              under certain circumstances in that particular case, a prisoner
              could be released.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Order does not allow for consultation. I
              am glad that we, as a Committee, attempted to plug the gap by
              saying that if the Secretary of State wants to use those
              wide-ranging powers he must, at least, consult. He must consult
              with people who are openly recruited and appointed as independent
              commissioners.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third area that concerns me is the role of
              the independent commissioners. I think that the Committee was
              agreed that the commissioners should be independent and
              independently appointed. Indeed, on page 18 of the report, we
              recommended that the commissioners</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;should be independent of Government and
              appointed through open competition&quot;.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We recommended that they should,</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;in exercising their functions, have
              regard for the Convention rights of life prisoners&quot;.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is essential that those commissioners
              demonstrate that they have human rights experience, because to
              date most commissioners have not been able to demonstrate that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are two issues relating to the
              commissioners: who are they — they should be independent — and
              what are they entitled to hear? The non-disclosure of material to
              commissioners causes great concern right across the community. If
              we believe in fair trial, there must be a fair and transparent
              legal system. Such a system could not include a mechanism that
              would allow a prisoner to be shut out of a hearing so that he or
              she would not know who was making the accusations or what case was
              being made and would not be able to respond directly to the
              allegations. I share with most members of the Committee the
              concern that the draft Order allows for something that could lead
              to a travesty of justice. We should guard against introducing an
              Order that could pervert justice. That is why I support the
              relevant recommendations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we first considered it, the draft Order
              contained no article that addressed the issue of victims’
              rights. That was disappointing. I am glad that the Committee’s
              recommendations in relation to article 3 proposed that the
              commissioners should listen to representations made on behalf of
              the victims. Prof Dickson, chief of the Northern Ireland Human
              Rights Commission, gave evidence to the Committee and suggested
              that, at the very least, a victim should be able to make a case in
              writing. I agree. However, there should be a mechanism available
              to victims that would allow them to make their case to the
              commissioners, so that the commissioners would know exactly the
              feelings that they would evoke and the reaction that they would
              cause if they were to allow a particular prisoner to be released
              on licence.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is essential that people understand how
              victims feel. Until now, they have been excluded from the process.
              The one thing that the Secretary of State should learn from
              consideration of the legislation is that victims have rights. He
              should give them not only a voice but an ear in the process.
              People must see that victims have rights and that they must be
              listened to.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Prof Dickson said that he would consider with
              the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission the issue of how
              victims should bring their case before the sentence commissioners.
              On page 59 of the report, we have published a letter from Prof
              Dickson that reveals a careless and flippant disregard for the
              rights of victims:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the Commission was not able to discuss
              further the respects in which victims’ views could be taken into
              account.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The professor goes on to say</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;we had so much else to discuss that day
              that we did not reach that item.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not doubt that Prof Dixon is a busy man
              and that the commission is a busy commission. However, the fact
              that there was so much else on the agenda that victims’ rights
              were not even reached will be a bitter pill for victims of crime
              to swallow. Their rights must be considered.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many people perceive that more attention is
              paid to prisoners’ rights than to those of victims. The letter
              from Prof Dickson and the Secretary of State’s Order do nothing
              to dispel that perception. Many people will argue that that is
              just a perception and that prisoners have a hard time of it.
              However, that perception must be addressed. If life is too busy
              for the views of victims even to be taken into account, they will
              be justified in holding on to that perception. Victims have been
              ignored until now. I hope that the recommendations that we have
              made in respect of the Order will spur the Secretary of State and
              the Northern Ireland Office into recognising that they must take
              cognizance of victims’ views.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.45 pm</p>
              </i><b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr J Kelly:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I
              too want to congratulate the Chairman and staff of the Ad Hoc
              Committee for the work that they did in a such a short time. The
              question of time is important, as Alban Maginness pointed out. The
              usefulness of the Ad Hoc Committees comes into question when no
              time is given to properly conduct an inquiry into the subject that
              is under consideration.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We asked the Secretary of State to attend a
              Committee meeting, but the invitation was refused. That is a
              further indication of how little regard they have for Ad Hoc
              Committees. The same is true of the judiciary and their
              non-attendance at the Committee.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We welcome any move that aims to put human
              rights legislation into practice. It is not enough to amend
              existing legislation or to adopt a model that has been designed
              for use in England and is fraught with problems. There are a
              number of radical progressive alternatives in Scandinavia, for
              example, that provide fair and more humane regimes.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It must be remembered that, for the most part,
              the intermediate and subjective elements of life sentences have
              been used against Republicans. There is nothing new in this system
              to guard against that happening again. My party has long argued in
              favour of the abolition of both mandatory and discretionary
              indeterminate life sentences. The proposed introduction of a
              tariff system throws up many new concerns that will only compound
              the problems associated with life prisoners and those that are
              being detained at the Secretary of State’s pleasure (SOSp).</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the judiciary were given the power to set a
              tariff — with all the connotations that its loyalty to the Crown
              has — what checks and balances will be put in place to ensure
              equality under the law for both victims and perpetrators?
              Political prisoners are still being brought before Diplock courts
              with all their inherent bias and willingness to convict on the
              most dubious of evidence. It must be noted that the only two
              prisoners that were given natural life sentences were Republicans
              who were convicted of single killings. That contrasts sharply with
              the treatment in court of the Loyalist death squads such as the
              &quot;Shankill butchers&quot;. There is much that we can do about
              that, but we should be mindful of these things when considering
              any new proposals.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If a commission is to be set up to oversee the
              release process, a number of safeguards must be put in place to
              ensure that the system is open and fair. The Secretary of State
              currently has extensive powers to deal with life and SOSp
              prisoners that should be given over to the commission. Sentencing
              should be a matter for the judiciary, and release should be a
              matter for the commission. The separate arrangements that are in
              place under the Good Friday Agreement are the appropriate
              mechanisms for dealing with political prisoners.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The commissioners should be representative of
              the community and not simply political appointees drawn from
              particular professional classes. The commission should be open to
              representatives of community organisations such as community
              restorative justice committees. We should be told clearly what
              skills, experience and training the commissioners will need. The
              commissioners will need staff. The staff should not be drawn from
              the Prison Service or the Civil Service but should be independent
              and accountable only to the commissioners.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a need for clear guidelines,
              definitions and directions to be given to the commissioners. Terms
              such as &quot;risk to the public&quot; need to be defined. There
              should be widespread consultation on the issue, and it should
              include the views of the community, ex-prisoners representative
              groups such as Coiste na n-Iarchimí and Restorative Justice and
              prisoners themselves. The review process should be transparent and
              open. There should be no secret hearings or undisclosed evidence.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Prisoners should have the right to be present,
              along with their legal representatives or any other person
              nominated by them. People serving life and those serving sentences
              at the Secretary of State’s pleasure need to be able to
              challenge any aspect of evidence presented and any decision of a
              review or commission hearing.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The present system of phased release needs to
              be overhauled, to give a meaningfully structured release programme
              of paroles. Information and support should be part of the release
              process, but the Prison Service is not necessarily best equipped
              to provide that. Consultation with current and former lifers would
              be useful in that regard. After a period has elapsed, the
              commission should have the power to annul licences. Former life
              sentence prisoners and prisoners at the pleasure of the Secretary
              of State should also be afforded that facility. Release should be
              unconditional except in the case of sex offenders, who should be
              placed on the sex offenders register.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The criteria for releasing a lifer or a
              prisoner at the pleasure of the Secretary of State on
              compassionate grounds should be clearly laid out and administered
              by the commission. That would avoid situations where prisoners are
              discriminated against, as has happened in the past with British
              soldiers released after serving only a few years. The power of
              recall should be removed from the Secretary of State, who is,
              after all, a political appointee. Recall should not happen unless
              new evidence is brought before a court.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the outset I congratulated the Chairperson
              and the members of the Committee for the work that they did in
              such a short time. The question of Ad Hoc Committees and their
              usefulness, considering the scant amount of regard that is given
              to them, should be taken up by the Business Committee.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr B Hutchinson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will start by declaring an interest in this,
              as a former life-sentence prisoner still on licence. I have not
              had that licence removed, even though I have been released for 11
              years. Also, for the Hansard record, I will clear up
              misinformation from John Kelly, which I know he did not give
              deliberately. In the case of the &quot;Shankill butchers&quot;,
              two people were sentenced to natural life, and on the day of
              sentencing the judge repeated that both should serve natural life.
              Also in the 1970s, two other Loyalists were sentenced to death for
              the killing of a policeman, but both had the sentence commuted. We
              should not give out misinformation. I do not know why we are
              talking about Loyalists and Republicans. I would like to think
              that that is all behind us. We are now dealing with a new breed of
              prisoner.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have to agree with what John Kelly said about
              the tariff. I am concerned when I hear people talking about
              rehabilitation and then a tariff. We need to decide what happens
              to people when they go to prison — is it about rehabilitating or
              about punishing? I think that a tariff is about punishing, not
              rehabilitating. How can you sentence someone to life imprisonment
              and say that he should serve at least 15 years before you consider
              him for rehabilitation? You can only judge whether a person is
              rehabilitated by their actions in prison. There is no evidence to
              suggest whether a person is rehabilitated or not.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with Alban Maginness that we need
              evidence rather than information, but the information that keeps,
              and has kept, people in prison for a long time has only been
              information — it has not been evidence. If we were to take
              examples of people who have been in prison for a long time,
              whether Republican or Loyalist, the information was given by the
              Prison Service and by people on the outside, who made a judgement
              of whether the prisoner would be a risk to society. How can
              someone decide that when there is no evidence, only information?
              In some cases that information was 15 and 16 years old — not
              current.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to be careful about that. I want to be
              careful about setting tariffs. Rehabilitation is an individual
              thing, and not something that you can lay down for everybody.
              People take different lengths of time to be rehabilitated — some
              can be rehabilitated quite quickly; others cannot. From my own
              experience, having been in prison, I think that some people are
              kept in prison too long — they have been rehabilitated, but
              actually start to turn back. They feel that they have been
              victimised, not because of something they have done but because of
              something that people think they are doing or have done. That is a
              big danger. We need to be careful about tariffs.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like everyone else, I need to mention that we
              lacked enough time to respond to every issue. We can complain
              about that bitterly from now until the cows come home, but it is
              not going to solve the problem. However, the report is very good,
              and the Secretary of State and others reading it will get a lot of
              information from it. It should help them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Someone once said that nothing concentrates the
              mind like a hanging — no pun intended. That is what happened to
              us: we had to concentrate on the job in hand. Mr Paisley Jnr was
              right when he said that we had to agree on some things and agree
              to differ on others. At least we produced a report, and it is an
              example of how this Assembly has worked well. We all set our minds
              to trying to achieve that, even though we may not necessarily have
              agreed on the issues.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are problems as regards the Secretary of
              State retaining certain powers. I hear quite a lot of people
              saying — and I agree with them — that there is a difficulty
              with the decision being a political one. Politicians can be
              lobbied. However, I would remind them that very few judges in this
              country do not have a political view. Regardless of whether the
              view is a party political one, it can be either right or left of
              centre — and God help the prisoner if it is right of centre, for
              he will probably not get a fair deal.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We really have to be careful about pinning the
              responsibility on politicians. Judges also have a role, and I am
              not sure that the judiciary is independent from political thought
              or political beliefs. I would not expect it to be. Judges are
              human beings and they are entitled to hold political opinions.
              However, is it possible for them to detach themselves from their
              opinions when they are actually doing their job?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr quoted quite a good example, and
              I was thinking about it while he was speaking. I was thinking
              about his work with the &quot;UDR four&quot;. Very few people
              wanted to get involved with the &quot;UDR four&quot;, but Mr
              Paisley stuck his head above the parapet. He has to be commended
              for that. He proved to be right in the long run.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The point is that there are ills in this
              society. There have been travesties of justice the whole way
              along. Therefore we need to have some sort of mechanism to deal
              with that. At the end of the day, and irrespective of whether
              people go back to court to get their cases reopened on appeal, we
              have to have some mechanism whereby the Government can decide that
              cases need to be re-opened. These will be political decisions.
              However, we need to find the appropriate mechanism.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We cannot divorce the judiciary from politics
              completely. It cannot be done. It is a matter of fact and a matter
              of life. All of these things are cross-cutting, and we need to
              have powers whereby politicians or Government can have cases
              re-opened. It is a question of being above board and letting
              everybody see it being above board. We need to address the system
              that facilitates it and ensure that it is above board, so that
              every person can have that right. Criteria should be laid down,
              and if people meet the criteria their cases could be reopened.
              Those are all important issues.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to be careful regarding the recall of
              prisoners. I do not think that anybody in the Committee would have
              disagreed that there is a lack of clarification about when people
              could be recalled and when they could not. I am very concerned
              about it because it is a thorny issue. We need to ensure that
              there is no breach of the European Convention on Human Rights.
              That is very important. Some of the evidence given to us suggests
              that it might have been the case on some occasions in the past.
              Therefore we need to be careful about the recall of prisoners and
              take a longer look at it. We need to make sure that there is some
              consultation with others and that we get opinions from them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate the Chairperson and Committee
              staff again for pulling this report together. We will have more Ad
              Hoc Committees, and we may not have the time to respond to every
              issue that we would like to have.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.00 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, we need to respond in the short time
              that we have. If this is anything to go by, we can produce
              reasonable documents — in fact, good documents — in a short
              time. This report and the flags report are examples of how we will
              deal with legislation on reserved matters. We must respond, no
              matter how little time we have.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Attwood:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I associate myself with the comments of Billy
              Hutchinson, Alban Maginness and Ian Paisley Jnr about the work of
              the staff and about how agreeing to disagree meant that there was
              no more serious conflict on the Committee.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several themes and principles that arise from
              the Ad Hoc Committee’s report are relevant to this discussion
              and others. First, I share the concern that the Secretary of State’s
              consultation with the Assembly on the matter was inadequate.
              However, as we also know, it goes further than that. At the public
              hearing, Brice Dickson, the chief commissioner of the Northern
              Ireland Human Rights Commission, replied as follows to a question
              about whether the Northern Ireland Office had consulted the Human
              Rights Commission before the draft Order was issued:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;No. We received the first version before
              Christmas, at the same time as everyone else.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The statutory body responsible for human rights
              matters in Northern Ireland, as laid down by an Act of the British
              Parliament was not consulted in any way prior to the issue of the
              draft legislation. That should not surprise us. At the Ad Hoc
              Committee on flags, a similar question was put to the chair of the
              Equality Commission, Joan Harbison, and she confirmed that the
              Equality Commission had not been consulted by the Secretary of
              State or the Northern Ireland Office in advance of the issue of
              the draft Flags (Northern Ireland) Order 2000. There is a
              structural problem with consultation with the Assembly and the
              main statutory bodies in the North that are responsible for the
              issues that have arisen from draft legislation. That structural
              problem must be addressed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like others, the SDLP welcomes the draft
              legislation, although not without objection. We welcome it for
              several reasons. First, as Prof Jackson said at the public
              hearing, the draft legislation introduces a principled and
              human-rights-based approach to the release of life prisoners.
              Although there are weaknesses in the draft Order, that principled
              and human-rights-based approach is the appropriate method for the
              consideration of future legislation. That should be made explicit,
              which is why the Committee has recommended that article 3 be
              amended to read as follows:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;In discharging any functions under this
              Order the Commissioners shall have regard to&quot; —</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">inter alia —</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the Convention rights of life
              prisoners&quot;.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That makes explicit the principled and human
              rights-based approach to the release of prisoners that Prof
              Jackson said was implicit in the draft Order.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are some even more compelling principles
              that inform both the draft legislation and the recommendations of
              the Committee. If the Assembly can agree to endorse those
              principles in relation to this draft legislation, I would like us
              to endorse the application of the same principles when it comes to
              our own legislation. They are good principles, and they represent
              good practice.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, there are a number of principles in the
              legislation and in the Committee’s recommendations about the
              independence of membership of statutory bodies, the transparent
              working of statutory bodies and the belief that such bodies should
              be free of political interference. That is why the Committee said
              that in order to ensure that members are independent in
              discharging their functions, they should have security of tenure
              for at least five years in the first instance. That will ensure
              that people who are fulfilling a public function do so independent
              of obvious external pressures. A tenure that is limited to one,
              two or three years is an external pressure. By creating certainty
              of tenure, one creates greater certainty of the independence of a
              member. That principle should apply across the board in relation
              to public nominations. In due course the Assembly may have to
              consider that principle in respect of other public nominations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, appointments to public bodies should
              be decided through open competition. That is an appropriate
              principle that should influence those who are appointed to public
              bodies. It should apply equally to other public appointments. In
              the North there are approximately 3,500 people appointed to
              quangos and similar organisations. We should have, and are
              beginning to have, a rigorous system of open competition for
              filling those appointments. That is good in practice and
              principle, and it informed the Committee’s report.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, and at the risk of going into
              uncertain territory, another principle was flagged up in the
              Patten Report on policing. It said that there should be a robust
              separation of powers between the policing board and the Executive.
              Those principles also informed the Committee in its
              recommendations to the Assembly on the powers of the Secretary of
              State and the powers of the Commissioners.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are passages in the draft report where
              the Committee states that there should be a robust separation of
              powers between the Secretary of State and the Executive on one
              hand and the Commissioners on the other. Those examples include
              the power of the Secretary of State under the draft Order to
              recall a prisoner and the power of the Secretary of State and a
              judge to determine what part of a life sentence prisoner’s life
              sentence should be served where he has been transferred to the
              North from another prison. There are a number of other examples,
              but they escape me at the moment. The Committee endorses the
              principle of a robust separation of powers between the Executive
              on one hand and a legal authority on the other. That principle
              should begin to inform the Assembly in other deliberations yet to
              arise.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fourthly, the principle of transparency is also
              important. The Committee’s report says explicitly that while
              there was discussion about transparency, it has concerns about the
              Secretary of State not discharging information about a prisoner in
              certain circumstances. While the draft Order introduces a special
              advocates clause in order to mitigate the prospect of a prisoner
              not being aware of matters that might be relevant in the
              consideration of his case, the Committee said that that was not
              adequate to ensure that there was an accountable and transparent
              process when it came to determining what a prisoner should or
              should not know.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It should be for the Commissioners to decide
              what information is or is not made available to a prisoner whose
              case is under consideration — not for the Secretary of State or
              the special advocate. That is an important principle. If the
              Assembly accepts that principle, it will have a wider application
              in other ongoing procedures in Northern Ireland where information
              is not made known to a certain person because it may be
              security-related or security-relevant.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a consequence, in the North there are
              procedures where a special advocate process is already in place in
              spite of the difficulties that some of us think are associated
              with that procedure. If the Assembly considers that the special
              advocate procedure is not adequate with respect to the release of
              life prisoners, then the Assembly may, in due course, similarly
              consider that it is not appropriate or relevant in other cases.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The final point I want to make is about release
              on licence. While Alban&nbsp;Maginness and others have dealt with
              the substantive parts of the Committee’s recommendations, I want
              to highlight that part relating to the release on licence of a
              life prisoner. It seems inconsistent to say that if the process of
              imprisonment is an exercise in deterrence and rehabilitation, and
              if a life sentence review board concludes that the deterrence
              principle has been satisfied, the licence cannot be annulled. The
              rehabilitation principle should be satisfied to the point where a
              prisoner on a life sentence licence should have that licence
              annulled. That person should be treated equally with every other
              citizen.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the report.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Savage:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have heard the views of many Members. This
              is a very complex issue. When the Committee was given the task to
              do, it got tore into it. Many loose ends had to be tied up. The
              Committee knew that there was a job to be done, and we put our
              backs into it. Overall, there is support for the report. The
              Committee worked hard to arrive at the report, and there was
              agreement on the need for this legislation. There was also
              agreement on the Committee’s recommendations and concerns, and
              they are all highlighted in the report.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a good report. It speaks well for every
              Member who contributed to it. I would also like to thank the staff
              for their hard work. We have put into place, I hope, new
              legislation that will bring about change in an area where it is
