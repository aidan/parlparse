              <p ALIGN="left"><b><font SIZE="3">Mr Speaker:</p>
              </font></b><center><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following last Monday’s Question Time, Mr
              Derek Hussey raised a point of order seeking clarification on the
              convention adopted by the Speaker or Deputy Speaker in choosing
              supplementary questioners.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The choice of supplementary questions is at the
              discretion of the Speaker or Deputy Speaker, and there are many
              matters to be taken into account. I have discussed the matter on
              several occasions with the Business Committee. There is the need
              to balance satisfactory exploration of the issue with the need for
              Ministers to answer as many tabled questions as possible in the
              time available.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Aside from the question from the Member who
              tabled the question, I shall ordinarily call a maximum of two
              further supplementary questions. I do that to ensure that Members
              who take the trouble to table questions are not excessively
              disadvantaged by other Members who request to ask supplementary
              questions. I shall not generally call more than one Member from
              any party to pose a question or supplementaries to it. In
              addition, I shall not call a Member to pose a supplementary
              question who already has a listed question on the Notice Paper
              that may be reasonably expected to be reached by the Minister
              during Question Time.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are many other matters to be taken into
              account, such as the preference accorded to Chairpersons and
              Deputy Chairpersons of Committees whose Minister is answering the
              particular questions, the preference accorded to other Members in
              a constituency, when a constituency is the subject of a question,
              and the recognition of Members who have a standing interest in the
              issue to hand.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With only two supplementary questions and at
              least five major sections of the House, if not more, it is clear
              that on many occasions there will not be a balance within a
              question. However, the Speaker or Deputy Speaker does try, as far
              as possible, to maintain a balance over time. I have studied
              Hansard in respect of this period of questions, and I am content
              that, as far as was reasonably possible, the proper conventions
              were followed in questions to the Minister. I hope that this
              assists in clarifying the matter for the Member and the House.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hussey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. The Minister
              mentioned people who had a relevant interest in the issue.
              However, two members of the Committee for Regional Development
              were not called to speak. In spite of the cross-community nature
              of the Assembly, no one was called to speak from this side of the
              House.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have to say that I think the Member is
              picking and choosing; he needs to be careful that he is not
              challenging the Chair. The question of the occupant of the Chair
              at any time is not a matter of issue. The conventions are clear,
              and Members will see that the matter was properly attended to. I
              hope that the Member will read all of what I have said, not just
              the bits of it that happen to suit that particular question for
              himself.</p>

              91 farmers from West Tyrone under Standing Order 22. I acknowledge
              the work of Omagh district councillor, Bert Wilson, who is a
              farmer and a signatory of the petition. The petition is in support
              of the transfer of the Department of Agriculture and Rural
              Development permit office from Sperrin House, Omagh, to the
              agricultural mart at Drumquin Road, Omagh. The concern of the
              petition is further heightened by the closure of parking
              facilities at the former Omagh Showgrounds site, thus increasing
              the difficult access problems at the current location of the
              Department’s permit office and the problems associated with
              parking in Omagh generally.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That this Assembly expresses its grave concern
              about the future of primary care services in Northern Ireland and
              calls on the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety
              to take prompt action to allay the serious concerns of the
              professionals and staff working in health and social services
              about the arrangements for local health and social care groups.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The debate is about the future of primary care
              services in Northern Ireland. The Prime Minister, Tony Blair, and
              successive Secretaries of State have told us that the Health
              Service should be primary care led — it should be led from the
              coalface: from the bottom up; not from the top down. The former
              direct rule Minister, John McFall, produced a document some time
              ago called ‘Fit for the Future — a New Approach.’ It was
              addressed to the New Northern Ireland Assembly, and it expressed a
              vision of health and personal social services as a single
              integrated service centred around primary care.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The needs of people were to come first, and the
              needs of organisations were to come second. The proposed new
              groups are to be committees of the health boards. I welcome the
              end of fundholding because of the inequities in the system.
              However, the four health boards have been around for years,
              carrying out the commissioning for non- fundholding practices, and
              they have not succeeded. We are moving backwards rather than
              forwards.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I unequivocally support the setting up of new
              primary care groups, with multidisciplinary teams working
              together. However, the guidelines should have been issued a year
              ago — certainly, at least 10 months ago. Our vision for primary
              care should be similar to that in England — empowering
              front-line staff to use their skills and knowledge to develop
              innovative services, with more say in how services are delivered,
              and empowering patients to become informed and active partners in
              their care.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We understand the massive financial constraints
              on the Minister and the Department of Health, Social Services and
              Public Safety and I am aware of the recent report by the Northern
              Ireland Confederation for Health and Social Services (NICON),
              which covers the four boards. One of the points that it made was
              that an extra £100 million per year is needed, in real terms,
              over the next 10 years to bring the service up to an acceptable
              level. I accept that there has been a legacy of underfunding over
              many years. However, a 7·2% increase for the health budget was
              announced in October 2000; £17 million was allocated in November
              2000; £14·5 million was allocated in January; and a further
              £18·5 million was allocated in February. In total, the budget
              available for 2002-03 will be over one third — 37% — larger
              than the budget when the Minister took office. That is an increase
              of £687 million.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are huge pressures on primary care
              professionals. I must refer to the waiting lists, which everyone
              is currently talking about. I accept that there have been 20 years
              of underfunding, and I appreciate the efforts that the Minister
              has already made. We have the problem of the cancellation of
              outpatient clinics. We have so-called bed blocking — I do not
              like that term, but we all know what it means. I am aware of the
              Minister’s framework for action on waiting lists announced in
              September 2001 and the boards’ comprehensive waiting list plans
              and quarterly monitoring reports. Indeed, I think that there are
              also bimonthly meetings. However, if there were one board instead
              of four it might be easier, and we might get more uniformity of
              services across the North.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 20 February, the Minister announced the
              establishment of 15 new local health and social care groups, and I
              will quote from her press release at that time. Commenting on the
              high degree of consensus among stakeholders in establishing the
              new groups, the Minister said</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;I hope this will point the way to a
              continuing focus on partnership, co-operation and shared
              objectives, which will be crucial for the new Groups to fulfil
              their full potential.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept that, but there was not consensus
              among stakeholders on the option that the Minister chose. In the
              same press release the Minister said</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The experience of the five Commissioning
              Pilot Groups has shown that GPs and other primary care
              professionals working together in groups have improved the
              provision and quality of local services.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with that statement, and I would have
              thought that the new primary care groups would be based on such
              pilot groups. However, Dr Harold Jefferson, chairperson of the
              successful Lisburn commissioning pilot, said in a recent letter to
              all MLAs</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;I am deeply distressed and disgusted at
              the present plans for the local health and social care groups.
              What is to be their function?&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Jefferson goes on to make the point that
              although we are told that the groups are developing from the
              commissioning pilots, they bear scant resemblance to these
              organisations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 1 March, the director of primary care in the
              Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety replied to
              Dr Jefferson. In his letter the director blames the Assembly,
              because it voted last year to delay the ending of GP fundholding.
              However, Mr Speaker, you and Members know that the purpose of the
              amendment was to facilitate, and ensure that the Department
              brought about, a seamless transition into new primary care
              structures. Over a year has passed, and we do not have any such
              transition. The director also said</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">

              introduced in the last nine or 10 months. I have heard
              explanations from the Department about finance and personnel. It
              can juggle the figures in whatever way it likes, but the fact is
              that at least 10 months have been wasted. The guidelines must have
              been ready a year ago, and I do not see why they were not

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the first point, I am aware of
              the redeployment centre in the Central Services Agency. I have had
              telephone discussions with the relevant person there. I hope it
              works out, but I have doubts about it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The bodies that wrote in totally supported the
              new groups, as we all do. They do not, however, make any reference
              to delays. Correspondence was also received from Prof Salmon,
              Chairperson of the Northern Ireland Trust Nurses Association, from
              the Directors of Nursing in the boards and from the Association of
              Directors of Social Services, whom we met last week. There were
              also a couple of other groups. We all support the local health and
              social care groups, but it is a question of how the groups are set
              up and why the guidance was not given long ago.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister appeared before the Health
              Committee on Wednesday 6 March to discuss the health budget and
              primary care. We were pleased that she did, and it took several
              hours to cover both subjects. At the meeting, reference was made
              to the Committee meeting on Wednesday 27&nbsp;February, when
              representatives of the Royal College of Nursing, the British
              Medical Association GPs’ Committee and the Royal College of
              Midwives attended. Those bodies requested a meeting with the
              Minister. Members will have a copy of a letter dated 19 February,
              signed by Dr Brian Patterson, Mrs Hilary Herron of the Royal
              College of Nursing and Mrs Breedagh Hughes of the Royal College of
              Midwives, in which they expressed extreme worries about the
              situation. Those three groups represent many front-line staff,
              and, therefore, the Health Committee advised them that they should
              seek a meeting with the Minister. At the Committee’s meeting
              last Wednesday, we were told that no such request had been
              received. I subsequently found out that a letter, signed by all
              three representatives, was handed in at Castle Buildings on
              Tuesday afternoon. I am not suggesting that the Minister knew
              about that, but the letter was handed in.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I strongly support the primary care groups. We
              will be in big trouble if we do not get primary care right,
              because it is the basis of the whole Health Service. Everyone
              concerned must be involved in meaningful dialogue.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the end of fundholding, and I
              sincerely want the new primary care groups to succeed. We have had
              a golden opportunity for change. Perhaps it is not too late. The
              people of Northern Ireland deserve the best; it is now up to the
              Minister and her Department to achieve that.</p>

              order to facilitate as many Members as possible, I am imposing a

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My background is in community child health,
              although I trained as a general practitioner. I am acutely aware
              that early diagnosis has become increasingly important, due to
              recent advances in drug therapy and the potential gains from the
              modification of risk factors. In most areas of medicine early
              diagnosis assists the GP, as it permits the formulation of a
              management plan, which obviates much of the later crisis
              intervention. Family practitioners remain the central core of the
              provision of support and co-ordination in medicine, which benefits
              both patients and carers.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not a member of the Committee for Health,
              Social Services and Public Safety, but I keep in close contact
              with my Colleagues on it. The Department’s consultation paper,
              ‘Building the Way Forward in Primary Care’, had many positive
              features that can be readily supported. The proposals were
              outlined in section 6 of the document, following an analysis of
              five models or options in the previous section. This is the model
              described as option 3, evolving into the option 4 model. Both
              models involve the creation of multidisciplinary care groups to
              serve populations of between 50,000 and 150,000. Option 3 proposes
              groups that would be mainly advisory, while option 4 proposes
              groups having devolved commissioning budgets.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If any approach is to be successful in
              developing the agenda for change in health and social care and
              developing the full potential of primary care, we must clarify the
              concept of primary care to include health, social and community
              care. It is inevitable, and highly desirable, that closer working
              relationships with community trusts will develop, and, eventually,
              integration can take place between the new local health and social
              care groups as equal partners.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Adequate resources will need to be prioritised
              to allow the new groups to flourish. Important areas include
              training and managing support and resources for infrastructure and
              programme development. The costs involved in information and
              communications technology (ICT) development are considerable, but
              essential if desirable quality improvements are to be realised.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much will depend on the overall resource
              allocation to health and social care. If the allocation is
              inadequate, no amount of innovation or efficiency will be able to
              deliver the required outcome. Northern Ireland should aim to have
              at least the same resource per capita as any other region in the
              United Kingdom — preferably a sum that fully reflects the
              additional needs of our population.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Option 4 might not be an end in itself, but it
              is a firm foundation for further developments in integrated health
              and social care delivery. The Department has said that it must
              ensure that the right structures are in place and that the right
              policies are pursued in order to achieve the Executive’s
              strategic priority of working for a healthier population. However,
              we must not become bogged down in bureaucratic wrangling when the
              real war is against disease, social injustice and the inequalities
              in health and well-being for a large section of the population.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Berry:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion does not argue for the retention of
              GP fundholding. Indeed, the argument is not about the merits or
              demerits of GP fundholding, which, as it is currently constituted,
              is dead in the water. Those who wish to rehash arguments over that
              issue have lost the plot, or at best they want to deflect
              attention away from the real issue that the motion is concerned
              with.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A recent newspaper report about the discontent
              over the circumstances surrounding the ending of GP fundholding
              exemplifies all that is wrong about the way in which the Health
              Service is run in Northern Ireland. It is one thing to remove GP
              fundholding, but it is quite another to turn back the clock by 10
              years without any understanding of what will replace it, or
              without the implementation of a replacement that will fit in with
              the improvement of the Health Service. That is not only sheer
              incompetence but official ignorance under the guise of skill.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Wilson] in the Chair)</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In its wisdom the Assembly gave the Minister
              and the Department a year to come up with clear plans that were
              properly resourced and carefully set out, and which could be
              supported fully by the Committee for Health, Social Services and
              Public Safety and the primary care sector. Instead, the Minister
              was aggrieved when the Assembly delayed the ending of GP
              fundholding for another year. That was a wise decision. There was
              no replacement on the table, under the table or outside the door.
              There were not even mirrors. It is now one year later and —
              surprise, surprise — the issue is not much further forward. It
              is little wonder that professionals are distraught and angry. The
              seamless transition is non-existent. The Minister has angered just
              about everyone who is involved in the delivery of services.
              Doctors, nurses, midwives and a host of other professionals are
              extremely angry at the latest botch-up by the Department.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What has been happening? Since the issue was
              last debated in January 2001, little has happened. In the past few
              weeks, however, there has been some activity. The Department
              issued a press statement on 16 October 2001. Impressively, it took
              from January 2001 to October 2001 to come up with that. The
              statement was followed by a circular on 14 December 2001. There
              was no consultation or negotiation before, during or after those
              events. It is an attempt at change by uninformed, incompetent
              diktat. It is clear that if the Minister had spoken to
              professionals, she would simply have exposed her own ignorance.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister promised the Assembly that when GP
              fundholding was replaced, all would be well. All is not well, and
              worse still, there will now be a gaping hole where once was there
              were clinicians in operation. That is hardly the most brilliant
              piece of leadership. There is chaos, uncertainty and, at best,
              mere cant. It is unacceptable that just a few weeks before the
              changeover nothing concrete is in place. Perhaps everything is
              supposed to happen over the next couple of weeks, as if by magic.
              Furthermore, there is no blueprint. Neither the Health Committee
              nor the Assembly has been presented with the finalised blueprint
              for primary care, a blueprint that should have been debated and
              voted on by the Assembly. That would show professionals where
              things are going. How the Minister can continue to make piecemeal
              changes without a plan is beyond the comprehension of any rational
              individual.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister, the Department and those who work
              in the primary care sector do not know where things are going. Not
              once has there been a simple outline of how the removal of GP
              fundholding, in the absence of any specific transitional scheme to
              finalised agreed arrangements, will improve either the quality or
              quantity of care. There has not been one piece of hard, factual
              data. The Assembly is entitled to hear how the removal of GP
              fundholding will improve the quality and quantity of care to
              patients in the absence of a transition to finalised arrangements.
              Where are the hard, real, factual data?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 17 January 2001 it was recorded that the
              Chairperson of the Health Committee expressed the strong view of
              the Committee that GP fundholding should cease only when the
              Department could make the planned seamless transition to an agreed
              alternative.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Amazingly, we are no further on today. Those
              who argued against our motion last year said that it was wrong.
              One Member had the nerve to suggest that an extension would not
              allow for a proper replacement for GP fundholding to be put in
              place and that it ought to go immediately.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must listen to the British Medical
              Association (BMA), which wrote to the Committee for Health, Social
              Services and Public Safety about the end of GP fundholding and
              said that there had been no detailed guidance, no details about
              timescales, no proper resources, no meaningful consultations, no
              primary care development funding and no details about the
              redeployment of GP fundholding staff. That is a clear vote of no

              commissions to address the Committee. The Committee has only heard
              from groups opposed to the transition from GP fundholding to
              primary care. Even within those groups, there has been marked
              disagreement over the way forward.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thought that the Committee’s function was
              to bring the Minister before it to address its concerns about
              primary care and to ask people working in that sector to give the
              Committee their views on the transition from GP fundholding to
              primary care. That did not happen. There was no consensual
              discussion from those representative bodies in favour of primary
              care. Their point of view was not heard. The only point of view
              that the Committee heard came from those who were ostensibly
              opposed to the introduction of primary care. The Royal College of
              Nursing, the Royal College of Midwives and the BMA disagreed among
              themselves over the way forward.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was inappropriate for the Chairperson of the
              Committee, as a GP, to bring the motion to the House without
              declaring his interest in the transition from fundholding to
              primary care.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The House of Commons Select Committee on Health

              in primary care, whether in general practice or community trusts,
              were finding the pace of change quite threatening, so there have
              been difficulties in England, Scotland and Wales with the
              transition from fundholding to primary care. Such expressions of
              doubt and concern have not just come from this Assembly, its

              Health Service.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My colleague and I oppose this motion, because
              ample opportunity was not given to practitioners in primary care
              to express their views to the Health Committee. There are
              difficulties, but the best way to address them is for the
              Minister, the Committee and all the groups involved in the
              transition to meet and discuss how those difficulties could be
              solved. A more orderly method of teasing them out is by discussion
              and debate. There is no doubt that primary care is the care of the
              future — by all objective standards of critical analysis it can
              ease tensions in the Health Service. Go raibh maith agat.</p>

              bringing a vital subject to the Floor of the Assembly. I also
              welcome the Minister and hope that she can help us to overcome our
              concerns.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must not forget that the one-year extension
              to GP fundholding brought benefits to local communities. However,
              we are a few weeks away from the introduction of an entirely new
              system, and I am deeply disappointed that very little is known
              about how things are expected to work out. I hope we are not
              experimenting with the health, and possibly the lives, of people.
              Ordinary people want and expect a good local GP service, and in
              general they are not interested in how it is administered.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All Assembly Members have received

              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the opportunity to change the HPSS to
              work better for the population has also been ignored.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We see proposals that still have no clear
              vision or commitment. They create a set of new bureaucratic
              quangos. They have no obvious purpose or goals, certainly none
              that could not be achieved by existing arrangements.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, the Hayes Report identifies the

              not seem to be the aim of current policy guidance, and it
              certainly will not be its outcome.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support local primary care groups that can
              and must make a difference to the health of our constituents. I
              appeal to the Minister to heed the advice of medical professionals
              who have years of experience and are willing to see change
              succeed. There is no reason to change the system unless we are
              confident that it will bring early benefits to health provision
              for everyone. That must be a priority for all. I support the
              motion.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Health and social care groups will improve
              prospects for better services if they are developed through
              meaningful engagement between professionals and service users. The
              experience drawn from successive primary care pilot schemes has
              shown that family doctors, community nurses, social workers and
              other professionals can work together successfully to redesign and
              develop services for the community. For the benefit of all, we
              must grasp and exploit the opportunity to extend this concept to
              people throughout Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The purpose of local health and social care
              groups is to give the people who work in primary care, and the
              communities that they serve, more influence over the way in which
              services are arranged and developed. At present, planning and
              development of the services is organised through what is called
              &quot;commissioning&quot;, and responsibility rests with the four
              boards. It is important that, under the new arrangements, the next
              few years will see local health and social care groups gradually
              taking on more responsibility for commissioning services. Most
              importantly, the process must be undertaken through effective,
              collective working between professional staff and community
              representatives. We hope that the boards will be fully committed
              to actively supporting the growth and development of these groups.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have stressed on several occasions the
              importance of how the 18 members of each group will be chosen.
              When the groups become fully operational, five of the members will
              be GPs, and the remainder will be made up of a range of
              grass-roots health and social care professionals, including those
              allied to medicine, nursing, pharmacy and social work. It is
              significant that two members will be community representatives who
              will promote the interests of patients and other service users.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Scotland, England and Wales are already moving
              in this direction, and it is time for Northern Ireland to develop
              such community groups. A balance must be struck between
              representation and the obvious need to not make the groups
              cumbersome. Initially, not everyone will be able to achieve
              representation. We are glad that there is a mechanism to review
              the situation within 18&nbsp;months. Groups will be able to be
              flexible, but I stress that midwives should be represented on them
              — they must not be left out.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand the Member’s concern about
              midwives. The Royal College of Midwives expressed that concern, so
              I raised the matter with the Minister in the Health Committee
              meeting on Wednesday. The Minister said that, in the guidance,
              &quot;nurses&quot; is used as a generic term and does not exclude

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for that information. That
              is good news, and I hope that midwives will be included.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Real opportunities to improve services and
              build community confidence and the confidence of professional
              staff do not come often and must be quickly and properly grasped.
              It is clear from letters that we receive that there are concerns
              about the Health Service, but they can, and should, be addressed
              through the normal channels. My Colleague, Monica McWilliams, as a
              member of the Health Committee, will be working to allay those
              concerns.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Making changes to health and social services is
              rarely risk free. However, it is a hugely important task that is
              often wrongly perceived as presenting a threat to the stability of
              existing services and to the jobs of much- valued health and
              social care staff. Health and social care groups can strengthen
              services — they pose no threat to the roles and jobs of
              front-line staff. If anything, they maximise opportunities for
              staff and provide a basis for professionals from many backgrounds
              to interact more readily with patients and to tailor successfully
              services to meet their specific needs.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although we accept that the Minister should
              work hard to allay existing concerns, we do not support the
              motion. This is a real chance to make meaningful and constructive
              change to primary care services in Northern Ireland, and we should
              take that chance when we can.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. It is public knowledge
              that the Health Service as administered in Northern Ireland is
              dysfunctional. The waiting lists are not only the worst in the
              United Kingdom, they are the worst in Europe, and it is plain that
              organisational reform of the delivery of primary healthcare is
              nothing short of chaotic. What are the reasons for that? The first
              reason is how resources are used, and the second is the delay in
              this much-needed reform.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Dr Hendron rightly pointed out, capital
              investment in the basic infrastructure of health was underemployed
              for many years under direct rule. However, that merely underlines
              the failure of those who agreed the terms of devolved Government
              to ensure that the underspend on capital infrastructure funding
              was made good.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having said that, resources are also being
              massively reduced by a welter of bureaucratic expense under
              devolved Government. Several weeks ago, I pointed out that £1·2
              billion will be spent on the administrative costs of running the
              11 Departments and the Assembly. Almost 14% of the block grant is
              being spent on feeding the Assembly and its administrative
              processes, which are a dripping roast for those who benefit from
              them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have been recently informed that the cost of
              ministerial cars, which are provided by the Assembly and by the
              Administration, amounts to £1·2 million per annum. Something
              must be done about resources. We shall not receive more resources
              through any increase in the Barnett formula, so they must be
              obtained in other ways — and not by petty efforts such as
              raising the rates by £12 million to screw many small businesses
              and put them out of business when that £12&nbsp;million will
              cover only one third of the £36 million needed to meet the Office
              of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister’s administrative
              costs alone, Mr Trimble’s Department. Therefore, something must
              be done about resources.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also the issue of organisational
              reform. It is plain from correspondence to Members from the
              professional organisations affected by these reforms — GPs,
              midwives, nurses and other care professionals — that the
              transitional arrangements for going from fundholding to the
              provision of primary healthcare through local health and social
              care groups is nothing short of a disaster. The Minister has
              provided no guidance on the core issues. Local groups cannot
              influence either the commissioning of secondary care services or
              primary care development, and we have no details of the timescale
              within which the groups will be able to do that other than a bare
              statement in a circular.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister’s statement of 16 October 2001
              about groups progressing to delegated budgets as quickly as they
              can demonstrate their capacity to deal with them entirely ignored
              the fact that a broad spectrum of fundholders and other groups
              have experience of controlling their budgets and could do that
              efficiently. There are no guarantees with regard to service
              provision to patients after 1 April. However, the Minister has
              done something about that belatedly. The funding arrangements are
              totally inadequate. In Northern Ireland the funding will be £3
              per patient; on the mainland the funding is between £7 and £8
              per patient. How can any form of comparable primary healthcare
              service be delivered when the cost of providing that is being cut
              from £7 or £8 to £3? There is also a lack of meaningful
              involvement of all stakeholders in the process, and there has been
              no meaningful consultation on the constitution of the groups, the
              management boards or the remuneration arrangements.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In response to John Kelly, I will close by
              stating that most groups are totally opposed to what is happening.
              The South and East Belfast Primary Care Group had this to say:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;In February 2001, the Assembly rejected
              the timetable then proposed to develop new Primary Care structures
              issued by the DHSSPS. The Assembly accepted the argument that the
              gap between the ending of existing arrangements on 1 April 2001
              and the earliest operational date of any new proposals would be
              detrimental to the provision of Primary Care services.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister and her Department have wasted an
              entire year and have failed to put in position any guidance,
              instruction or constitutional arrangements whereby primary care
              can be developed. I have great pleasure in supporting the motion.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGrady:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I approach the motion and its expression of
              concern for the new structural arrangements based on information
              that I have received from people on the streets and in
              constituency offices, including people from the medical
              fraternity, and their experiences. There is enormous and grave
              concern that the new structure is not even designed to deliver
              better primary care and will constitute yet another bureaucratic
              structure laid over an already overstructured delivery of medical
              facilities.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is concern about the levels of
              bureaucracy and the levels of resources that were supposed to be
              available for the new development. I hoped, as did all laypersons,
              that the new structure would speed up access to primary care and
              contribute to shortening the much-quoted waiting lists, which are
              causing increasing daily concern to people on both elective and
              non-elective waiting lists. An increase over the past year of
              14·5 % and a failure by the Department to achieve its set targets
              and explain why those targets are not being met against a
              backcloth of increasing funding are shortcomings, not least in
              clarity.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must try to achieve that clarity so that we
              can redress what appears to be happening, which seems to be —
              and I cannot substantiate this with facts and figures — more
              money chasing less effective delivery. If that is the case, it
              requires an urgent and extreme remedy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I come to the debate not from the point of view
              of statistics or finance but from my experience and knowledge of
              the unnecessary pain and suffering being placed on families, the
              communities and the country. The relief of pain and suffering is
              the objective of all medical services.</p>

              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGrady:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No, I have just started. I will give way when I
              come to something substantial that the Member might wish to query,
              but I have not dealt with the generics yet.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is correct to look at how efficiently and
              effectively the Heath Service is administered, but that must be
              done with the objective of achieving better relief of pain and
              suffering. We cannot include in a motion such as this the
              provision of care for cancer patients, because that is not primary
              care — although initially everything is primary care. People are
              literally dying against a backcloth of a lack of medicines and
              treatments that are available elsewhere, and that is never
              acceptable in a society such as ours.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alongside that, medical professionals — GPs,
              midwives and district nurses — do not know how the proposal can
              work, and they do not know why it has been made. In fact, GPs have
              asked the Department to explain the objective, purpose and
              facilities that will drive the new structure, which will start in
              two weeks, but they have not had a meaningful answer.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have heard Members talking about a variety
              of bodies — the Royal College of Nurses and the Royal College of
              Midwives — who say that there has been no meaningful
              consultation on their participation. However, district nurses and
              midwives are primary carers. If they do not know what is going on,
              what, in the name of God, are the patients going to do?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">GPs are not sure about what is happening and
              what will be expected from them. The new body to be set up — and
              I stand to be corrected on this — will consist of GPs, who will
              get an extra £17,000 a year for administration. All of the
              others, midwives, district nurses and lay people, if there are
              any, will get nothing. This is not an even-handed scheme that will
              encourage co-operation and a better development of resources.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The BMA finds the process incredible. It says
              that there is no long-term vision, no medium-term plan and no
              short-term direction. It criticises the lack of information it is
              receiving from the Department, information that is necessary to
              achieve what, it is hoped, will be an improved system of delivery.</p>

              for giving us a timely opportunity to speak on the subject.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to focus on the local health and social
              care groups, because they are very much at the nub of the motion.
              As several Members have said, it is significant that many care
              professionals have expressed doubts about the proposed
              arrangements, notwithstanding the general support for the broad
              principles of primary care groups as set out in ‘Fit for the
              Future’.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.00 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, the current proposals from the
              Minister and the Department are inadequate to empower and
              resource, as Mr McGrady mentioned. For example, where, in the
              current proposals, is there clear, detailed guidance on the
              formation and function of local health and social care groups?
              Crucially, why is there is no meaningful involvement in
              commissioning from the outset? If that does not occur — and some
              of us doubt whether it will ever occur in the future — social
              care groups will simply become another talking shop in a sector
              that has too many layers of administration.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A more malign interpretation of what may be
              going on is that to the extent that the groups will include
              membership from the health boards, this change is, in effect, a
              way of entrenching the power and position of the health boards.
              That is something that should be subject to review, and I hope
              that it will be subject to investigation during the overall review
              of public administration. Furthermore, there seems to have been a
              complete lack of involvement of many of the grass-roots
              stakeholders, especially community nurses and professions allied
              to medicine.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our primary health care system differs
              substantially from, for example, that in America and much of the
              rest of the EU. Many commentators have judged that features of our
              primary system, especially the way in which GPs and others act as
              gatekeepers to care elsewhere in the system, are good features
              that should be cherished and developed. The problem with the
              Minister’s proposals is that instead of carefully prepared
              evolutionary change, we seem to have in the offing, from the
              beginning of next month, something that is, in effect, a diktat.
              Diktats may well be attractive when coming out of a revolutionary
              approach to politics, but, in general, they are not a sensible way
              in which to engage with the major stakeholders, civil society, and
              to make sensible, evidence-based approaches to policy. I have
              great pleasure in supporting the motion.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. There are many people
              with cancer in my constituency, which has a predominantly elderly
              population. The GP surgeries are so packed that we must plan to be
              sick at least two weeks in advance. If, God forbid, we plan to
              injure ourselves, we must give one week’s notice to the
              treatment room for an appointment with the practice nurse. Those
              are facts.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is unbelievable that someone who has severe
              pain because of a genetic disorder cannot get relief from pain
              that has been debilitating him for at least three days, because
              that is the earliest that he can get an emergency appointment.
              Such patients know that they are not ill enough to attend
              casualty. Many also do not feel that they are ill enough to sit
              for four to 12 hours in a busy emergency department when all they
              need is a prescription for pain relief that could be easily taken
              care of with a ten-minute chat to their GP, who is familiar with
              their condition.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The NHS plan states that, by 2004, the
              Government will have revolutionised their primary care services.
              By 2004, many people will have encountered much pain and
              discomfort. Many will have resorted to incurring large bills for
              private treatment, so that at least they can see someone when they
              are ill and not two weeks after the event.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have all heard of the baby twin across the
              water who died after NHS helpline staff told her parents that she
              had colic and how to treat her. The baby had meningitis and died
              in days. Believe it or not, the Government plan to use the
              helpline and an Internet site even more to reduce the number of
              people using the doctors’ surgeries and the numbers in the
              waiting rooms of doctors’ surgeries and hospitals. Is that just
              another way of fudging the figures? Many believe that that is a
              possibility. As elections approach, the need to reduce waiting
              times will help people to focus more.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Primary care, like every other part of the
              public sector, was underfunded by the Government for 20 years. The
              Conservative Government put the primary Health Service under
              self-management, and, to some extent, that worked. However, the
              population keeps growing, and the funding has stayed low.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some GPs have found a better way of managing
              the money and do not want the new reforms, as they are now
              presented, to come into effect. They are just beginning to pull
              together under the strain that the last reforms caused. A surgery
              in Strangford took a long and incisive look at the patients that
              attend there. They found that they fell into two categories —
              the asthmatics and the elderly. The doctors put a major part of
              their budget into those two problems and set up a clinic for
              asthmatics to free some of the time that they spend with their
              patients. Patients with asthma now have an allotted time for
              seeing their doctor and the main nurses.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The doctors also set up an elderly patients’
              well-being clinic to deal with flu vaccines and other forms of
              preventative care to free space during the day for other patients.
              By giving those two groups weekly clinics, the doctors have seen
              great improvements in other areas of their practice. They have
              been able to see more of other patients, and they do not have
              these problems in greater number than before. Asthma is an
              increasingly common condition in modern society.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those doctors, and many like them across the
              Province, took the initiative and made fundholding work for them.
              However, as usual the Government, instead of investing the money
              where it is needed, will restructure and shove this bit and remove
              that bit, and, lo and behold, we will have a new and improved
              &quot;primary care service&quot;.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Doctors in my constituency have contacted me
              with complaints about the restructuring of the primary care sector
              of the Health Service. GPs have been told that this new scheme
              will be the answer to their prayers. Doctors disagree strongly.
              They believe that there has been no long-term vision, no
              medium-term plan and no short-term direction for putting the new
              scheme in place. Doctors have said that neither the Minister nor
              anyone from the Department can tell them, except in vague terms,
              what the strategy is. They fear that patient- focused primary
              care-led services are being replaced with cost-effective primary
              care.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Health Service should not be about money.
              However, for certain conditions, a week’s drug treatment can
              cost up to £1,000. Does the strategy take into account the time
              and energy that doctors need to face the problems caused by the
              inadequate system that is proposed for April? Doctors fear that
              because of the stress and strain of implementing another of the
              Department’s schemes for cutting corners and money, they will
              lose colleagues with many years of experience under their white
              coats.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Doctors have finally got to grips with the
              fundholding strategy. Many have used it to further their practices
              by getting more nurses and other services such as
              physiotherapists, opticians, dentists and counsellors to join
              their units and form one-stop clinics for all their family needs.
              Other surgeries in my constituency have looked at other areas of
              the profession, such as patients with heart complaints and ECG
              monitors. These doctors do not think that the system is broken,
              and wonder why the Department is trying to fix it, and fix it in a
              way that will leave those who are trying to work in the new
              system, with only weeks to go before it is enforced on them, with
              only vague notions of what will happen?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Doctors whom I have talked to say that we
              should look at the system in England, and I agree. With my
              concerns and those of my constituents in mind, I call for answers
              to be given.</p>

              is right that Mr John Kelly should call on the Chairperson of the
              Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety, Dr
              Hendron, to declare an interest. That is part of the procedure in
              the House. He was not implying that Dr Hendron did not do that
              deliberately. He was saying that it was right that it should be
              declared.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members have said that there are concerns among
              the professionals about the new arrangements for primary care. I
              also have concerns, and after Mr John Kelly and I met the
              professionals last week, I agreed to raise those concerns with the
              Department and the Minister. Many of us are not experts on what is
              happening. Several Members have admitted that, without going into
              detail on the establishment of the new arrangements because they
              are not members of the Committee.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We met with people who were in favour of the
              new arrangements and also with people who were opposed to them.
              Contrary to what many are saying, there are people who are happy
              with the new arrangements. The Committee should have allowed those
              groups to give their views. When changes are in the air, hard
              decisions must be made. People are concerned about taking that
              leap of faith. They have relevant concerns, and we should take
              them through those changes step by step.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister gave evidence to the Committee for
              Health, Social Services and Public Safety on Wednesday 6 March,
              when she gave a presentation and answered questions. In the
              limited time that I have, I wish to place her answers on the
              record. The Minister said that the objective of the new groups is
              to reduce bureaucracy, promote inclusivity among primary care
              professionals and move resources into front-line services. She
              told the Committee that the groups’ aim is for local people and
              local health professionals, using their expertise and knowledge of
              what is needed, to come together to ensure that those needs are
              met. I do not believe that anyone could oppose that.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Mr Speaker in the Chair)</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members spoke about the £3 per head
              for administration costs and the fact that in England and Wales it
              is £7 or £8 per head. I could not stand here and justify any
              more money being spent on administration. We have all spoken about
              the levels of administration in the Health Service. My conscience
              would not allow me to argue for more spending on administration
              and less on front-line patient care.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister answered several questions on
              issues that have been raised in today’s debate, such as the
              make-up of the primary care management boards. The Minister told
              the Committee that she was confident that the configuration of
              those boards was such that no single group would be dominant and
              that representation would be well balanced. I agree with that,
              because there should be no single dominant force. If we are to
              tackle collectively the needs of our communities, many people
              should be involved.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice mentioned the inclusion of midwives
              in the guidance. That was put to the Minister, who told the
              Committee that two posts would be available for nurses and that
              the use of the generic term &quot;nurse&quot; did not exclude
              midwives and health visitors.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Concerns were raised that some nurse-led
              services would be lost under the new arrangements. The Minister
              gave an assurance that all health care provided under GP
              fundholding would be maintained. The Royal College of Nursing also
              raised that. The Committee met with that organisation on 27
              February, and I asked its representative to give me an outline of
              the services that it thought would be lost. To date, I have not
              received that information. We must approach this in a mature
              fashion. Many groups favour the establishment of the new primary
              care arrangements, and we must give them the benefit of our
              attention.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are concerns that another level of
              bureaucracy is being created that will result in yet another
              talking shop. We were told in the debate on the Executive’s
              review of public administration, which, in my view, should have
              started a long time ago, that the Department is confident that the
              new groups are flexible enough to be accommodated in any wider
              structural change. Were we being told to delay or that GP
              fundholding should not be changed until the outcome of the review
              while, in the same debate, we were told that we need to tackle the
              level of bureaucracy in the Health Service?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several issues must be taken on board. GPs are
              an essential part of the new plans. However, up until now, they
              have not been a part of the Health Service in contractual,
              financial or employment terms. I commend GPs because they are

              They cannot drive the group, and they should not have the
              automatic right to chair the group. We can all tackle the need for
              services and promote health in our communities.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend the Minister and the Department for
              ensuring that community representatives and service users will be
              involved in the new groups. Go raibh maith agat.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hamilton:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. A year ago the Minister
              was intent on ending GP fundholding, with no system available to
              replace it. At that time, the Committee for Health, Social
              Services and Public Safety rightly refused to back what the
              Minister wanted to do in the timescale in which she wanted to do
              it. That delayed the ending of GP fundholding for one year. The
              intention of the delay was to give the Minister time to take into
              account the findings of the primary care review and the Hayes
              Report and to create what has been referred to as a &quot;seamless
              robe of medical care&quot;. Sadly, the Minister has squandered the
              opportunity given to her by the Committee and the Assembly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the intervening year, she has managed to
              annoy virtually the whole spectrum of primary care professionals,
              including GPs, nurses, midwives and community care staff, not to
              mention the Health Committee. One has only to read the minutes of
              evidence given to the Committee by the groups that I have
              mentioned to gauge the level of annoyance that has been caused. I
              do not understand why the situation had to arise. If every other
              Minister and Department in the Assembly can work closely with
              their Committees, why is it that relationships between the Health
              Department, its medical staff and its Committee are in such
              disarray over this?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr J Kelly:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Member give way?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hamilton:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No, I will not give way.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee recently took evidence from those
              professionals, and the view is that the Minister has made minimum
              primary care proposals. She has missed a golden opportunity boldly
              to introduce what was envisaged in ‘Fit for the Future’. That
              system would have seen a patient-led Health Service with money for
              services allocated to the primary care groups and professionals
              close to the ground, who could decide on the most appropriate
              forms of medical care. That, however, has not happened, and we are
              faced with the creation of yet another level of expensive
              bureaucracy that will take money away from what it should be used
              for primarily — investment in patient care.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many Members are fully aware of the
              overadministration of medical services in Northern Ireland. The
              Minister needs to make immediate plans to stand down those
              organisations in order to bring about the devolution of medical
              funding to primary care groups.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs I Robinson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Detailed guidance on the constitution,
              governance and accountability arrangements for local health and
              social care groups, and the remuneration arrangements for those
              groups, was issued only on 12 February 2002 for implementation by
              the boards by 1 April 2002.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That leaves an unrealistic six-week timeframe.
              Having had 12 months to do all this, the Minister has left only
              six weeks for those involved to establish the local health and
              social care groups. What a waste of a year. In the words of the
              Northern Ireland Multi-Disciplinary Forum</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;A year of development time has been
              squandered, Assembly wishes ignored and, more importantly, the
              opportunity to change the health and personal social services to
              work better for the population has also been ignored.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister announced on 12 October 2001 that
              there was broad support for the preferred model proposed in the
              document entitled ‘Building the Way Forward in Primary Care’.
              However, the facts speak differently. The Royal College of
              Midwives, the Royal College of Nursing, and the British Medical
              Association, in common with most other professional health
              organisations here, did not support the proposal to establish
              local health and social care groups as committees of the existing
              boards. They saw that as adding another layer of bureaucracy to an
              already top-heavy structure for health care provision. That has
              not been helped by the failure of real dialogue between the
              Minister and primary care professionals.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many GPs believe that the arrangements the
              Minister intends to pursue will not enable primary care
              professionals to improve the quality or quantity of care for
              patients. GPs believe that fundholding was not perfect; however,
              nothing is. They rightly claim that we should build on the
              developments of the past and on recent innovations and start to
              protect services that have already been introduced. Their concerns
              — and they are genuine — are that no direction and no real
              additional moneys have been identified and that there is no
              capacity within primary care to increase services so as to reduce
              referrals to hospital and facilitate earlier discharge. In my
              meetings with GP representatives, they have often quoted the Hayes
              Report’s call for primary care services to be provided more
              locally, so that a high-quality service can interrelate with
              hospitals and lead to a higher rate of successful outcomes for
              patients. General practitioners believe that that will not happen
              under the proposed system; indeed, they believe that it represents
              a retrograde step.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is concern at the lack of clarity on the
              function of the local health and social care groups. The
              transition from the end of fundholding to local health and social
              care groups is only weeks away, yet the guidance issued to date
              focuses only on the establishment of the groups and is vague about
              their purpose and strategic direction. Many argue strongly that
              these groups represent another level of costly bureaucracy choked
              with red tape.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Boards will constitute the committees and from
              April 2002 will arrange the delegation of functions to local
              health and social care groups. Boards will be responsible for
              setting up the management boards of the local health and social
              care groups and for ensuring that they fulfil their primary care
              development. In collaboration with health and social services, the
              boards will develop the capacity to take on responsibility for
              commissioning hospital and community services.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The make-up of the local health and social care
              groups is also a matter for concern. Where GPs and other health
              care professionals have had some experience in primary care
              commissioning, it will be a completely new exercise for many
              others. Why did the Minister not use the last year productively?
              Why were no training exercises commissioned to enable primary care
              professionals to participate properly in the new groups? Who will
              make them up? Will they be based on the bottom-up philosophy, or
              will they be top heavy? It is proposed that GPs will have between
              three and five seats on each local health and social care group
              management board, depending on the size of population to be
              covered. Potentially, these boards will include up to six
              community trust representatives, one acute trust representative
              and up to two health and social services board representatives. At
              least three of the community trust representatives will be from
              director level, making a mockery of the bottom-up approach
              envisaged.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many other valid concerns have been raised by
              representatives of all the professions involved in primary care.
              For instance, why have midwives been excluded or ignored as an
              independent profession involved in primary care? They have failed
              to become eligible for seats on the health and social care group
              boards.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is to happen to the employees of GP
              fundholders and Eastern Multifund, whose contracts expire when the
              new arrangements come into effect? The Minister gave public
              assurances in the Chamber that she would be sympathetic to the
              needs of those people. At the time she claimed that to lose these
              highly skilled people and their experience would be terrible.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gibson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion because there were many
              features of great merit in the proposal. At the consultation in
              Omagh, local care groups were considered to be a good idea.
              Difficulties arose about what that excellent phrase &quot;good
              primary care&quot; meant. The consultation process showed that all
              GPs there seemed to have different levels of aspiration. Although
              they welcomed the principle and the idea, they wondered how it
              would translate into practice.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my area the Dunnamanagh practice caters for
              a large rural area that includes Ballymagorry, Bready,
              Magheramason and the rural hinterland attached to that that joins
              with Plumbridge and moves into Foyle. The Irvinestown practice
              covers a great part of mid-Tyrone and is joined with County
              Fermanagh. The Castlederg, Strabane, Newtownstewart, Omagh,
              Drumquin, Dromore and Carrickmore practices have local health
              pathways. Joining up the whole conglomeration will not lead to
              concentric health pathways. It was pointed out that operating
              large geographical areas as one local health unit, such as in west
              Tyrone, will create difficulties.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The consumer aspect was also raised. Every
              consumer has a high regard for his GP practice, which is the first
              port of call for him and his family. Consumers want to protect
              their practices and be sure that they will not be financially
              decapitated by another layer of local administration, which would
              include a chairman, a chief executive and 18 staff who will have
              to be paid attendance fees for their work. The funding for that is
              to come from the local practice area money. People view that as
              another barrier between them and the provision of care by the
              boards. They deem that costly administration as a great enough
              hindrance.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I speak for an area where there is
              less-favoured provision to meet health requirements and which
              scores high on the scale of health needs, in every possible way.
              The idea was welcome, but the last thing consumers want is another
              quango between them and the delivery of services. They do not want
              any further curbs or restrictions, financial or otherwise, between
              them and the health care provision they need.</p>

              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To tell someone what to do, or to impose a
              solution, is not what is meant by consultation. The decapitation
              of the financial provision is not helpful. Therefore, the lack of
              guidance, and the BMA’s and other health professionals’
              rejection of the plan, has left a potentially good idea in a
              quagmire.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask the Minister to re-examine the first idea
              for a seamless transition from the present system to one that is
              perceived to be good for local healthcare, but which appears to
              have no method of delivery. She must think again and allow time
              for change and for consideration of the guidance. We should learn
              from the mistakes that were made across the water, rather than
              repeat them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In supporting the motion, I ask the Minister to
              give the medical practitioners the time and direction that they
              need to make a good job of what has always been a great primary
              care service in their localities.</p>

              so, as usual, I shall take a slightly different line. I support
              the motion. No one can take issue with it. The motion expresses
              the grave concerns that the community, the Health Committee and
              the medical profession have.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am slightly disappointed that several Members
              feel that they cannot support the motion. The Health Committee
              works extremely well under the fair and understanding attitude of
              its Chairperson, Dr Joe Hendron, and Deputy Chairperson, Mr Tommy
              Gallagher. The Minister is present for the debate, so I assume
              that she has concerns also.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We shall know that when the vote takes place. I
              am not here to name people.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Surely there is no better way to deal with
              concerns than to deal with them immediately, not in six or seven
              months’ time. I do not want the issue to be fudged; enough
              issues have been fudged already. However, we all agree that GP
              fundholding will end and that we must replace it with another
              system.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The objective of establishing the new groups is
              to reduce bureaucracy and promote inclusiveness among primary care
              professionals. I want the Minister to state, if she can, how much
              money will be saved when we move from GP fundholding to local
              health and social care groups. Some time ago, I asked the Minister
              how much money would be saved if we were to cut the number of
              health boards and trusts. The Minister said that we would save a
              moderate sum. However, I was not sure what the Minister meant by
              &quot;moderate&quot;, because the word means different things to
              different people. Therefore I asked for an exact figure, but I am
              still waiting. I live in hope, as always, that she will provide
              that figure. If we were to have fewer boards and trusts, perhaps
              more finance would be available for the Health Service. The
              Minister should have examined all moneys that are spent directly
              on healthcare.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, the new health and care groups may
              have to change. Pharmacists feel that having only one pharmacist
              on a board is not enough. It is inadequate and unequal. However, I
              assume that the membership is not written in stone. I hope that
              the Minister will agree that if money can be saved on bureaucracy,
              it should go towards healthcare, which is more important than
              trusts and boards spending money on, dare I say, luxuries that the
              Health Service could do with.</p>

              in Members’ minds today must be the fears and concerns referred
              to in the motion. I acknowledge the ever-demanding workload of
              primary healthcare professionals — GPs, nurses, physiotherapists<b>,
              midwives, and many others. They are faced with that workload at a
              time when resources are scarce and the public’s expectations are
              increasing.</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members must also recognise that in the past
              resources for primary care have not been allocated fairly. There
              have been variations, inconsistencies and inequalities in the
              delivery of primary healthcare — for example, response times for
              out-of-hour services are much longer in rural areas than in the
              towns and cities. Members must also bear in mind the wider picture
              — how the Health Service measures up to the rest of Europe.
              There is no doubt that Northern Ireland lags behind. In many other
              countries the quality of service is well ahead of the primary care
              currently being delivered here.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Local primary care teams have been set up in
              many countries in Europe and in the USA. Doctors, nurses and other
              professionals come together with community representatives and a
              wide range of other interested parties in order to deliver the
              service. Those primary care schemes have shown that when they are
              given responsibility for budgets, they are able to target
              resources at those who are most in need in their local areas. The
              new local health and social care groups that are being set up on 1
              April 2002 can do the same in Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, that potential will only be realised
              if the Minister, the Department, the Health Committee and the
              Assembly ensure that the right foundation is there to tackle
              inequalities and deliver better standards of care to local people,
              regardless of where they live. If the Assembly gets primary care
              right, it will considerably ease the pressures that acute
              hospitals are presently experiencing.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That must include taking on board the valid
              concerns of health professionals and the general public.
              Accountability under the new arrangements is a major concern. The
              new groups will be subcommittees of the health boards. No elected
              representatives sit on the health boards. Members must understand,
              therefore, why people are concerned. Final decisions on primary
              care should not be left to the boards alone. There needs to be a
              Northern Ireland-wide steering committee involving those groups to
              manage the change and to build confidence in the new arrangements.
              Primary care needs a detailed and clear- cut timetable of what
              will be commissioned, by whom and when.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Local groups that will serve border areas must
              be able to work in a cross-border context if they are to properly
              address the needs of the local people. All aspects of primary care
              should be handled in the most open and transparent way.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are other concerns, not least the deep
              anxieties about possible job losses or about the downgrading of
              jobs for those employed in an administrative capacity under the
              current GP arrangements. I acknowledge that the Minister has made
              some attempts to address those concerns, but more work must be
              done. The Royal College of Nursing, for example, does not believe
              that the new arrangements will support the principles in ‘Building
              the Way Forward in Primary Care’. Those principles are designed
              to reduce bureaucracy, improve the delivery of the service and
              encourage grass-roots input into local health and social care.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been, as Members have said,
              insufficient time to digest all the new guidance that has been
              issued in the past few weeks. Training is a crucial issue if the
              capacity of the new local health and social care groups is to be
              maximised. We need an assurance that local primary care
              initiatives will continue and develop. I want the Minister to give
              a commitment that no services that currently operate under GP
              fundholding will be lost.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Health, Social Services and
              Public Safety (Ms de Brún):</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Beidh
              dhá fheidhm shainiúla ag na grúpaí áitiúla sláinte agus
              cúraim shóisialta. Ar an chéad dul síos, beidh siad freagrach
              as pleanáil agus soláthar cúraim phríomhúil, ach sa deireadh
              thiar glacfaidh siad le freagracht bhreise maidir le seirbhísí
              cúraim thánaistigh a choimisiniú. Sin gealltanas a thug mé;
              seo iad na feidhmeanna a bheidh ag na grúpaí.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Local health and social care groups will have
              two distinct functions. They will be responsible for planning and
              delivering primary care in the first instance, but they will
              ultimately take on the added responsibility of commissioning
              secondary care services. I have given that undertaking, and I
              shall outline the groups’ functions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Local health and social care groups will be
              statutory committees — not subcommittees — of health and
              social services boards. They will have clear lines of
              accountability to boards for their actions. That will be
              especially important when groups assume responsibility for the
              substantial public funds that they will manage when they take on
              commissioning functions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For an organisation of that nature to deliver
              on such a formidable agenda, it is essential that all health and
              personal social services sectors be represented, including people
              from trusts who will be able to deliver on the plans agreed by the
              group. It is essential that all those who were involved in the
              planning and delivery of services work together from the
              beginning.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Local health and social care groups are more
              inclusive than any other model in England, Scotland or Wales.
              Primary care professionals and services users will co-operate for
              the benefit of service users in their area. The involvement of
              primary care professionals and others in identifying local health
              and social care needs, and in deciding how those will be
              addressed, is an essential element of the commissioning process
              and is critical to the new groups’ success. The management
              boards of the new groups will be responsible for devising
              effective mechanisms to ensure the involvement of other
              stakeholders and members of the wider group who are involved at
              grass-roots level. That will ensure a bottom-up and inclusive
              approach.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important to recognise that the Assembly’s
              decision to delay the end of GP fundholding for a further 12
              months tied up resources that could otherwise have been devoted to
              developing the new arrangements. The actual implementation process
              has not suffered any delay. When GP fundholding was extended last
              year, I agreed, when I was asked, to extend the consultation
              period on ‘Building the Way Forward in Primary Care’. As I
              told the Assembly at the time, it was our intention to establish
              the new groups up to September 2001 as resources became freed up
              as a result of an end to GP fundholding.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.45 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was always the Department’s intention that
              the resources released from fundholding would be used to meet the
              cost of the new arrangements. The extension of GP fundholding
              meant that finance, people and resources could not be made
              available immediately to work on the arrangements for setting up
              new groups. Managing and monitoring the scheme in its final
              difficult year has absorbed resources which otherwise would have
              been devoted to the development of the new groups. Nonetheless,
              guidance on the new arrangements was developed simultaneously, and
              many complex issues were resolved.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the guidance was developed, it was also
              necessary to take soundings from the various stakeholders.
              Excellent progress has been made on the basis of the guidance
              issued so far. The groups’ configurations have been determined,
              and management boards are being established. It will take time for
              the groups to become established properly, and they will develop
              at different paces. Commissioning will be a completely new
              experience for many of those involved in the groups. Moreover, it
              will take time for groups to learn to work together and to build
              up the experience and skills necessary to carry out effective
              commissioning. It is difficult to predict precisely how long it
              will take for all of them to be able to take responsibility for
              budgets for commissioning services. However, I have set a firm
              target for some groups to take on the commissioning of some
              services from April 2003.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From the outset, budgets for prescribing
              management costs and primary care development will be delegated to
              the groups, and they will begin to establish their infrastructure
              and to formulate their plans for the commissioning and delivery of
              health and social services. They will be expected to identify
              local health and social care needs and to draw up plans to meet
              gaps in services. They will use their primary care development
              money to commission local primary and community care services as
              appropriate. Next year I intend to deploy additional resources
              towards primary care development.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The groups must decide on local priorities,
              taking account of resource constraints and other factors. They
              will also contribute to their individual health and social
              services board’s commissioning decisions, which will seek to
              reflect local dimensions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One objective of the new arrangements is to
              reduce bureaucracy. Another objective is to move resources into
              front-line patient care. The new arrangements reduce the number of
              commissioning bodies from 150 — the number of existing GP funds,
              plus pilots — to 15. The ending of fundholding means that there
              will no longer be short-term or individual case contracts. That
              too will reduce bureaucracy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By holding the administrative costs of the new
              groups to an average of £3 per head, £2·5 million can be
              diverted ultimately from administration to primary care front-line
              services. The level of management funding here is the same as
              level one funding in England. Those groups were at that level when
              they were first established. With regard to wider structures and
              what might emerge from the review of public administration, the
              financial impact will be examined as part of that review. The
              Executive have agreed that that examination is necessary.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The composition of the management boards of the
              new groups allows for representation of key interests, without its
              being too unwieldy. A Member raised that point earlier today. That
              does not mean that any profession that is not represented on the
              boards, or that has less representation than desired, will not be
              able to contribute fully to the work of the group. The facility to
              co-opt others onto the management board, and the opportunities for
              participation at subgroup level, should provide for the
              appropriate involvement of all professions and interests.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many Members have mentioned the preservation of
              services. I give an absolute assurance that all services provided
              by GP fundholders will be maintained until the new groups can
              decide on their future. I expect those professionals who currently
              provide those services to continue to do so. Most administrative
              GP fundholding staff will be redeployed in the service or will
              remain in their GP practice but engaged in other work. Initially,
              there will be 30 job opportunities in the new groups. The
              advertisement clearly states that midwives who work in the
              community will be eligible to apply for posts.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Boards have expressed their support for the new
              arrangements, and they will be held to account for their role in
              the development of the new groups. I will shortly discuss the
              general managerial structure.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those nurses, midwives, health visitors, social
              workers, professions allied to medicine (PAM) staff, pharmacists
              and community users or representatives who self-nominate will be
              paid for their work on these groups. Only those who are nominated
              by boards and trusts will not be paid, as it would be considered
              part of their ongoing work. Staff on pilot schemes will remain in
              place until they have had an opportunity to apply for posts in the
              new organisations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fears were expressed that certain interests
              might dominate the group management boards. Those fears are not
              borne out by the commissioning pilots, which also have board and
              trust staff on their management boards. Board and trust
              representatives will fill six of the 18 places on the new
              management boards, and GPs will fill five places. Therefore no
              single group or profession will dominate the new groups. Also, as
              part of their quota, boards and trusts must nominate a nurse, a
              social worker and a PAM representative. That means that there will
              be two nurses, two social workers and two PAM staff on each group.
              The generic term &quot;nurses&quot; refers to nurses, midwives and
              health visitors whose names are on the register of the UK Central
              Council for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting (UKCC). The
              management boards of the groups must then devise effective
              mechanisms to ensure the involvement of other stakeholders and
              members of the wider local health and social care group who are
              involved at grass-roots level. It will be up to the management
              boards of the groups to ensure that there is a bottom-up approach.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards the figure of £3 per head of the
              population for the new groups, the funding here is comparable to
              the funding of new groups elsewhere when they were being set up
              and before they took on greater levels of responsibility. I
              believe that this figure will be adequate for the initial stages
              of the groups’ development, but it will be kept under review.
              Maintaining administrative costs at £3 per head will also enable
              me to divert £2·5 million to primary care services. That money
              will be shared with the groups, which will decide how it will be
              spent. It is important to note that the figure of £3 per head of
              the population, which amounts to over £5 million, simply meets
              administration costs. It will be spent on allowances for
              management board members, support staff and on supporting any
              additional infrastructure that the local health and social care
              groups decide to establish. It may also be used for some internal
              training and development. I will make additional resources
              available for the purpose of providing or developing primary care
              services.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From April 2003, local health and social care
              groups will be able to commission a wide range of health and
              social services and to draw down from boards the necessary
              resources. The commissioning role of the groups will grow over the
              years as the groups gain experience and confidence. I cannot
              foresee the end point now, because health and social services
              structures may change following the reviews of acute hospital
              services and public administration. Both reviews address the wider
              question of structures. However, I am sure that the groups will
              play a growing role in the planning and delivery of services and,
              to look at it in another way, I have put no restrictions on the
              way in which the groups may develop.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards the configurations in the Western
              Board area, the groups there were formulated following discussions
              with the primary care professions and service users. There is
              widespread agreement on the configurations in that area. Perhaps
              someone will convey that answer to the Member who raised the point
              but who has since left the Chamber.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the importance of the overall allocation to
              health, I point out again that five sixths of the new resources
              for health and personal social services have gone simply to meet
              inflation — the rising costs of the existing services. The
              remaining amounts have been insufficient to keep pace with demand.
              The position has been exacerbated by real reductions in baseline
              funding extracted over the past two decades. Moreover, any
              available funding has been subject to the Barnett squeeze, which
              has led to lower levels of increases being made available here.
              During the 1990s, health and personal social services spending per
              head grew by some 25% in real terms. In England, growth amounted
              to 35%. Matters have worsened since then, and the allocations for
              the current spending review period widened the gap.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The service needs not just more resources but
              greater certainty about future funding levels, which will allow
              meaningful long-term planning. The NHS has had the advantage in
              recent years of greater resources and firm baselines for the
              future, and I hope that this year’s spending review will give us
              the opportunity to achieve that and that we can work to make that
              happen.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The end of GP fundholding on 1 April will have
              no adverse impact on services. People will still go to their GP or
              primary care professional and receive the same services that they
              currently receive. It is important to reiterate that all the
              boards have agreed that all services currently provided by GP
              fundholders will be maintained until the local health and social
              care groups can decide on their future. We have held discussions
              with GPs, nurses, social workers, pharmacists, boards, trusts and
              others to discuss the detail of the arrangements.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The formal consultation on ‘Building the Way
              Forward in Primary Care’ ran from 11 December 2000 until 31
              March 2001, and during that period departmental officials were
              involved in over 50 meetings, seminars and workshops. At that time
              I met the General Practitioners’ Committee of the British
              Medical Association (BMA) and the Royal College of General
              Practitioners. I met the General Practitioners’ Committee again
              in January 2002.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Prior to that, I was involved in a series of
              discussions with a wide range of health professionals and
              managers, including the BMA and the Royal College of Nursing, to
              listen to views about primary care arrangements, and there has
              been ongoing contact with officials. Many of the concerns that
              were raised have been addressed. Services will be maintained at
              the end of fundholding, staff will continue to be employed and
              professional staff will form a large part of the local health and
              social care group management boards. I have received a request
              from the BMA, the Royal College of Nursing and the Royal College
              of Midwives for me to meet them to discuss their concerns, and I
              have agreed to do so on Wednesday.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In answer to the point raised by Dr Hendron,
              that letter arrived by post on 7 March.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall proceed with the setting-up of the new
              local health and social care groups. The level of support
              expressed during the consultation exercise last year was
              extensive. Recent expressions of support have come from the
              Association of Directors of Social Services, the advisory
              committee for professions allied to medicine (PAM), the directors
              of nursing of the four health boards, the Foyle area nurse
              practitioners and general practice forum, community practitioners
              in the Health Visitors’ Association, and Armagh City and
              District Health and Social Services Community Forum.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Hendron mentioned opposition from Dr Harold
              Jefferson. However, I have also received support from some of the
              commissioning pilots, and there may be differing opinions on that.
              Many of those involved in the pilots have indicated that they will
              support the proposals that I am putting forward. I am proceeding
              because of the success of the commissioning pilots on which the
              new groups are based. I want to put more money into front-line
              services so that local people and local health professionals can
              work together in a multidisciplinary fashion to make local
              decisions about local services.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue of a wider structural change in
              health and personal social services remains firmly on my agenda.
              In developing health and personal social services that are fit for
              the twenty-first century, it is important to ensure that the
              organisational structure is appropriate for the efficient and
              effective delivery of services. Structures must support the close
              working of all parts of health and personal social services and
              also facilitate communications between health and social services
              and education, housing and other key public services. I believe
              that the new groups will allow that to happen.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive’s wish to review public
              administration here, and the issues surrounding the development of
              acute hospital services — and the mention made there of the
              wider structures — provide the wider context within which any
              proposals for organisational change must be developed. The new
              groups have been set up to be flexible enough to be accommodated
              within any wider structural changes.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Similar groups that were established in Wales,
              Scotland and England were originally subgroups of existing Health
              Service bodies. I am aware that if the new groups are to succeed,
              it is essential that funding be made available for the development
              of primary care services. Next year, I intend to deploy additional
              resources towards primary care developments. I have discussed my
              proposals with the Committee.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amounts will increase by £2·5 million in
              2003-04 once the balance of the money currently tied up in GP
              fundholding management allowance has been released.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, local health and social care
              groups represent the best option for primary care to assume a
              central position in health and social services. They provide the
              first important step towards a more inclusive and co-ordinated
              system for planning, commissioning, and delivering services. They
              will ensure that local people and local health professionals work
              together, in a multidisciplinary fashion, to make local decisions
              about local services. I hope that we can all work together in a
              spirit of co-operation, as we have been able to do on some of the
              wider questions, to ensure that the groups succeed. It is in the
              interests of patients and all the people that they do.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for being present for the
              entire debate. I listened carefully to what she had to say. I also
              thank all my Assembly Colleagues who participated.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Adamson mentioned early diagnosis and other
              important primary care issues, such as multidisciplinary groups
              and equality of partners in the new groups. Early diagnosis is
              extremely important. Mr McCarthy was positive in his comments
              about the need for a first-class service. However, he did say that
              we do not have a clear vision. He also described the way in which
              the groups are to be set up as quangos. Ms Morrice made positive
              comments, although I think that she said she was going to vote
              against the motion. However, I may have taken her up wrongly. If
              she is to vote against the motion, I do not understand why.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney spoke about waiting lists, which
              is a massive subject in itself. He said that we have the longest
              waiting lists in Europe. He also talked about the bureaucratic
              set-up in the Northern Ireland Health Service and mentioned
              various bodies that have expressed concern. Mr McGrady spoke from
              his experiences with bureaucratic structures, resources and
              waiting lists. He talked especially about pain and suffering,
              which is a key point as it happens daily. He also said that people
              are dying.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie focused on the groups themselves and
              on enhancing the power of the boards, which is also a key point.
              It is a top-down, not a bottom-up, structure. We are increasing
              the powers of the boards, and the Member mentioned the word
              &quot;diktat&quot; in that regard. Mr Shannon talked about cancer
              problems and about trying to get appointments with nurses in GPs’
              practices. He also mentioned the massive pressures on primary care
              services. We all know that there are asthma clinics, clinics for
              the elderly and many other clinics, but we are concerned with the
              overall strategy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr John Kelly made some points on which I wish
              to comment. First, he said that I had not declared my interest in
              primary care. On a point of order, in January 2001, during a
              similar debate, I definitely declared that I retained a slight
              interest in primary care. I apologise if I have misled anyone in
              the Assembly, but if I did, I did so inadvertently. I have never
              gained one penny through fundholding, and, as far as primary care
              is concerned, I shall not be involved in it for very much longer.
              However, I shall not go into that.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr J Kelly:</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Member give way?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Hendron:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall not give way. I normally give way to Mr
              John Kelly, but not when I am summing up.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr John Kelly also said that we had heard from
              no representatives of those who are in favour — in favour of
              what? We are all in favour of the new primary care groups. The
              discussion has been going on for years, ever since John McFall was
              the direct rule Minister. If Mr John Kelly is saying that all the
              organisations that we are discussing, as well as certain other
              groups that I listed in my opening speech, oppose the Minister’s
              decision, I have already dealt with them. Organisations such as
              the Northern Ireland Trust Nurses Association and the directors of
              social services, with whom we met last Wednesday, are well
              informed. Although they are not at the coalface, they support the
              new measures, just as we all support them. However, they are not
              querying the fact that the guidelines could have been laid down
              long ago. That is the key point.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Berry talked about turning back the clock
              and said that fundholding was dead. Of course, he is absolutely
              right. Mr John Kelly and Ms Ramsey queried having this debate in
              the first place. I point out to them it is only in the last six or
              seven weeks that details of the primary care groups have come to
              the people concerned, so it was impossible for the Committee for
              Health, Social Services and Public Safety to see every group that
              wanted to meet us. We have met as many groups as possible and I
              — <i>[Interruption].</p>

              interrupt a Member who is speaking. All Members got reasonable
              hearings, so I do not see why the Chairperson should not get a
              reasonable hearing too.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Chairperson, I have tried to facilitate
              every member of the Committee, including Mr John Kelly, with
              regard to the people whom they wanted me to meet in the past.
              However, with the key date being 1 April it was impossible for the
              Committee to meet all the groups. The Minister and her Department
              should have brought the groups along with them during the last 12
              months.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hamilton talked about an amendment and about
              an opportunity missed — most of us would accept that. Mrs Iris
              Robinson talked about the broad support for the Minister’s
              original model. However, there was no broad support for that
              model; there was broad support for the model in ‘Fit for the
              Future’, which was brought forward by John McFall.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In ‘Building the Way Forward in Primary Care
              - Summary of the Responses to the Consultation’, the Minister
              refers to &quot;respondents&quot;. As I said to her last week —
              if a wee man in the Cavehill had written a letter about the future
              of primary care, he would have become a respondent. All groups —
              primary care, nurses, midwives — are referred to as
              &quot;respondents&quot; and, according to the document, most of
              them are supportive.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gibson talked about the legacy of
              bureaucracy and about things being imposed. Ms Armitage’s grave
              concern was shared by most of the Committee for Health, Social
              Services and Public Safety, and she wants no fudge. My Colleague,
              Mr Gallagher, talked about the workload on primary care, increased
              public expectation, resources and, above all, accountability.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister described the primary care groups
              in detail. The Assembly supports primary care groups. Primary
              care-led health services are happening in these islands and in
              western Europe, and we agree with what the Prime Minister, Tony
              Blair, said about such a service. The reason for the amendment in
              January 2001 was to allow for a seamless transition.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister said that the committees were
              statutory committees of the boards — I hope we are not playing
              with words. There was no primary legislation involved. Of course,
              the matter is within the statutory arrangements of the boards, but
              they are still committees of the boards. I hope — it will not be
              before the election, but perhaps following it next year — that
              there will be primary legislation in the Assembly to give power to
              the people at the front line, so that there will be a truly
              primary care-led Health Service in which all professionals are
              equal and have direct links to the community.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will not raise the issue of the composition
              of the boards now. I will finish by saying that we want the best
              primary care for the people of Northern Ireland and that it is up
              to the Minister and her Department to bring people along with
              them. Mr John Kelly mentioned groups that we have not spoken to:
              all of them support the new ideas for primary care. Maybe it is
              not too late, but it is now over to the Minister and her
              Department.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is now some 15 months since I last
              introduced a major motion on agriculture to the Assembly. That was
              on 5 December 2000. At that time, the House unanimously supported
              the motion, which called for more proactivity on the part of the
              Department to redress the sorry state that agriculture was in at
              that time. Unanimity is not common in the House, so, when it
              occurs, Ministers should always take special note.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At that time, I proposed the adoption of a
              farmers’ early retirement and loan scheme, which — if I may
              paraphrase what would be a complex piece of legislation — would
              set out to enable older farmers to retire with dignity, a lump sum
              and a pension and enable young blood to enter the agriculture
              sector with new ideas, new perspectives and a business education
              behind it. The legislation that I proposed was based on the
              schemes currently operational in Denmark and France, so we were
              not in uncharted waters. Indeed, I had been in close contact with
              the Agriculture Ministries in both countries as well as with the
              appropriate directorates in Brussels and the now demised Ministry
              of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in London — a Ministry axed
              because of its lack of proactivity.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was enthused about the scheme from the
              contact that I had with its practitioners through my membership of
              the Committee of the Regions in the European Union. The most
              important feature of the scheme was that it would provide a proper
              and proven framework around which the farming sector could
              restructure itself. The need for the scheme was great in December
              2000 when we were in the middle of an unprecedented crisis in
              agriculture — foot-and-mouth disease was still to come. However,
              the need for the scheme is even greater today.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We may not be in a hurricane season. There may
              have been a slight improvement in farm incomes. I emphasise the
              word &quot;slight&quot;, because I challenge the Minister and her
              colleagues to explain to the House how they would live on the
              average improved income of only £5,800 a year that farming
              families now receive. Although we may not be in the midst of a
              hurricane, we are certainly not in fair weather yet.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However small or temporary the respite between
              crises may be, it provides a chance for us to act decisively and
              not in the midst of chaos. That is why I am advocating action now.
              I called for action in December 2000, and I am doing so again 15
              months later. It is the duty of the Government to provide a
              legislative framework to enable farming to restructure. A new era
              for farming is slowly emerging. It is an era driven largely by
              Europe, where the subsidy culture will soon be a thing of the
              past. It is an era in which the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries
              and Food’s successor Department, the Department for Environment,
              Food and Rural Affairs, has already set out a new role for farmers
              as custodians of the countryside.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The collapse of the former farming economic
              infrastructure has been driven by powerful forces. The strength of
              sterling has driven down our international competitiveness. There
              has been a disempowerment of the farming sector, and the sector
              has not restructured as quickly as the food-based industries that
              it sustains. As a consequence, farmers have been in a poor
              negotiating position with the big supermarket chains and the even
              bigger capital that they represent. World food prices have fallen
              when there has been economic prosperity for every other sector of
              the economy.</p>
              <i>

              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The farming sector has fared poorly compared to
              other sectors. People have difficulty identifying with the
              hard-pressed farmers. In addition, our farmers face competition
              from the Third World, the Far East and Europe, and trade
              liberalisation makes the problem worse. The report of the policy
              commission on farming and food was clear on the remedy for a
              sustainable future.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, farming must become more business-
              focused. The policy commission’s report said that it could
              become a vibrant, profitable business, attracting investment and
              new entrants by listening to the people who consume its products
              and conserving its most valuable asset — a healthy and
              attractive countryside.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We cannot reorganise farming into viable,
              healthy business-orientated, economically efficient units unless
              we restructure it, and that can be done only by introducing an
              early retirement scheme for farmers and encouraging young people
              who have been trained in agricultural colleagues and farms to take
              up the challenge and by providing Northern Ireland farming with a
              business plan. I am advocating both of those.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Minister does not introduce an early
              retirement scheme and provide a framework for restructuring, that
              is tantamount to saying that we will abandon farmers to the
              powerful economic forces I have mentioned. Some farmers will sink,
              and some will swim. That is not a recipe for ordered restructuring
              — it is a rout. It is an abdication of the duty we owe to an
              important part of our community that depends on agriculture for
              its living.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remind the House of the knock-on effects of
              that. Only 0·9% of the British electorate is actively engaged in
              farming. In Northern Ireland about 85,000 people are engaged, one
              way or another, in agriculture. The building trade employs only
              one third of that number. As an employer, farming is second only
              to manufacturing. For reasons of economic prudence, we should
              introduce an early retirement scheme and a loan scheme. Most
              Members would join me in doing that for common decency alone.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not propose to labour the details of the
              scheme today — Members have heard me talk about it often enough.
              They can read the details in the Hansard of 5 December 2000, or
              they can read one of the many recent articles in the press. The
              Minister has appointed consultants to look at this, and I want to
              convince the House that we need to act on it. Where is their
              report? We have been waiting fifteen months, and that is too long.
              We must not be like Nero, fiddling about while Rome burns.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to add some important provisos to the
              scheme that was set out in December 2000. We must tie the
              implementation into restrictions on production. Farmers are
              sometimes obsessed with producing more and more. What is the point
              of producing more, if it cannot be sold? That only drives the
              prices down. During the Northern Ireland Institute of Agricultural
              Science conference it was said that only 22% of farmers saw a need
              for radical change towards a market-oriented entrepreneurial
              culture, and that is very worrying. One of the main reasons
              identified for the failure of farmers is that they do not live in
              the real world.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government are sending out confusing
              signals. We must have a 10-year business plan for agriculture in
              addition to the early retirement and farm loan schemes. They are
              essentially two sides of the one coin, and they go hand-in-hand.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That 10-year plan cannot be definite. What can
              be definite in this fast-moving world? However, the plan must
              &quot;best guess&quot; the direction that world agriculture will
              take by using the most sophisticated tools available in market
              trends analysis and market intelligent methods. That is a major
              task.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the plan cannot be prescriptive, it
              must give farmers an idea of the realistic market options
              available in the next 10 years so that serious and viable planning
              can take place in agriculture. Only then can a proper investment
              climate be created. It is the duty of the Government to give a
              lead. However, the issues are of such dimensions that the matter
              should be taken on by the entire Northern Ireland Executive and
              not just by the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development.
              Given the importance of the agrifood industry as well as the
              agriculture sector, this is a strategic matter for the entire
              Northern Ireland economy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two avenues are open to us with regard to the
              financing of an early retirement scheme. Fifteen months ago, in my
              original submission to the Minister, I demonstrated how the scheme
              could be self-financing. If loans were restricted to those farmers
              with indebtedness of over £20,000, that would put some £1,440
              million into circulation. The total capital asset value of
              Northern Ireland farms is over £10·5 billion, a massive sum,
              compared with the total farmers’ indebtedness of some £700
              million, that is less than 7% of the capital asset value of the
              farms. The scheme’s best feature is that it would lock the
              capital asset value of Northern Ireland farms at normal interest
              rates, which would earn the banks or financial institutions
              charged with the administration of the scheme some £42 million a
              year. The scheme itself would cost some £20 million a year to
              operate in the first five years, and after that the costs would
              diminish significantly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Surely it is not beyond the imagination of man
              or Minister to tell the banks that they would generate a massive
              sum by simply operating the scheme and that they would be expected
              to plough a significant part of that back into the industry. Given
              the sheer volume of business, it might be possible for the banks
              to pay the total cost and still pocket profits of £22 million a
              year.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another option might be to redesign the
              regional policy of the United Kingdom, using Northern Ireland, as
              has been done on many occasions, as a test case, to bring the
              scheme in on the back of a permitted soft loan European strategy
              within the constraints of the European Union’s Agenda 2000
              regulations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a matter for the entire Executive,
              because the issues raised involve a significant level of
              expenditure and strategic planning decisions. We must position
              ourselves in the world market in a way that ensures viability in
              farm size and efficiency. Adequate business planning requires
              imaginative leadership, and now is the time for that. Many stories
              have been told about what happened to the agriculture industry.
              Having listened to the previous debate on health, agriculture must
              not get itself into the same position. We are all aware of the
              crisis facing the Health Service. I hope that the proposal will be
              examined comprehensively and that with a common-sense approach,
              the agriculture industry can be brought back onto a level footing.</p>

              who wish to speak, but a maximum requirement. That limit does not
              apply to Mr Savage, who moved the motion, or to the Minister who

              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Bradley:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion, but I do not imply that
              nothing has been done or achieved by the Minister or the
              Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. First, we should
              look at when the downward spiral in farming began. The mid-1990s
              — 25 years into direct rule — was the beginning of the end for
              many farmers. The Minister, the rest of the Executive and the
              Agriculture Committee have worked to deliver new hope to the
              farming industry, but in the three short years since it became
              locally elected people’s responsibility to address our problems,
              we have had the disruption of foot-and- mouth disease.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I attended an Ulster Farmers’ Union meeting
              on Tuesday night, and I was asked to convey publicly, on the union’s
              behalf, its gratitude for the Minister’s efforts during the
              foot-and-mouth disease crisis. Since November 1999, the House has
              experienced periods of suspension, so much has been achieved in a
              few working months. As a member of the Agriculture Committee, I am
              fully aware of the tremendous amount of work that has been done to
              get the agriculture industry working again. The Minister, the
              Department of Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee
              have worked together on many important issues. Since November
              1999, small farmers who were neglected for more than a quarter of
              a century have finally been recognised. Milk producers with a
              quota of less than 250,000 litres were given additional quota. The
              90-head limit on the beef special premium (BSP) was removed, and
              new protection measures were introduced for producers with fewer
              than 30 heads of cattle. A new milk scheme was introduced, and
              beef national envelope funds were revised and split sixty-forty
              between suckler producers and heifer producers.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Benefits for the long-term survival of the
              industry inevitably come about as a result of the cross-border
              animal health programme that the Minister is pursuing. The
              introduction of the new beef quality initiative will also ensure
              that Northern Ireland produce is of the best quality. A vision
              group was established, and its action plan should be up and
              running by June 2002. Work is under way to secure a future for the
              next generation and, as the Deputy Chairperson of the Committee
              has said, it is the hope of many, including myself, that
              developments will include a combination of a new entrants’
              programme and an early retirement scheme.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many other developments have taken place that
              are in the interests of the farming industry and broader rural
              issues. Those include: the reduction of red tape; the securing of
              funding; the backing of rural development; the Minister speaking
              up in Europe; support for the fishing industry; and the securing
              of regionalisation for Northern Ireland during the foot-and-mouth
              disease outbreak. So much was achieved in a short time. I support
              the motion, but rather than ask the Minister to consider the
              implementation of measures to sustain viability, I ask that she
              continue to implement measures that will allay the concerns of all
              who are interested in the future of the agriculture and fishing
              industries for the betterment of rural society overall.</p>

              schemes, including better disabled access and the installation of
              computer equipment. Seventy-four youth organisations have applied
              for grants so far. I encourage other clubs, particularly those in

              they have been denied? Schools, including Riverdale Primary

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In formulating their development plans, PEAGs
              are required by the Department of Education to give particular
              regard to the needs of rural areas. Prior to the expansion
              programme, the level of provision tended to be lowest in those
              areas. However, while there is a good network of nursery schools
              and units, pre-school playgroups and private day centres, local
              circumstances may be such that it is simply not possible for the
              intended level of coverage to be reached in some rural areas.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In some areas of the Lagan Valley constituency
              it has not been possible to achieve the intended level of
              coverage. That is largely due to local circumstances. For example,
              I am aware of one large village in Lagan Valley where none of the
              existing playgroups has applied to be allocated pre-school places.
              That operates to depress the overall level of coverage that can be
              achieved in that area. The Department is working with the South
              Eastern Education and Library Board PEAG to investigate what can
              be done to increase the level of provision in such situations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also aware that there has been much
              discussion about the issue of statutory settings, which are
              established in the controlled and maintained sectors. I am aware
              of the view that decisions about the funding of new statutory
              provision have discriminated against the controlled sector. Both
              sectors have benefited from the creation of new nursery provision
              under the pre-school education expansion programme.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are other initiatives, such as Belfast
              Regeneration — formerly known as Making Belfast Work — and the
              EU special support programme for peace and reconciliation. There
              are currently 155 controlled, 95 Catholic maintained, 13
              grant-maintained integrated and one non- Catholic maintained
              nursery schools and units in a total of 264. A further 33 new
              projects of all management types are currently being developed. I
              emphasise that all pre- school education provision is open to all
              children. There is considerable integration of attendance in that
              sector.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue must be dealt with in its proper
              perspective. The Assembly must acknowledge that in certain
              circumstances there are particular individual situations that do
              not reflect the overall picture.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Member’s question, because it
              is at the heart of the current debate on post-primary
              arrangements. The 11-plus test exists only because Northern
              Ireland has a system of post-primary education that allows grammar
              schools to select the pupils that they want and reject the rest.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is clear demand for the abolition of the
              test, but that cannot happen unless decisions are taken on the key
              issue of academic selection. Retaining academic selection and
              abolishing the test would require some other form of selection by
              grammar schools. Whatever system is used, it will perpetuate many
              weaknesses that have been identified by research into current
              arrangements.</p>

              made in the House and in public to the effect that it is important
              to realise that the abolition of the 11-plus test cannot take
              place unless academic selection is also abolished are, in fact,
              inaccurate? Will he also accept that it is possible to have
              academic selection by other means?</p>
              <b>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The consultation process, which ends on 28
              June, provides a golden opportunity for people to make
              suggestions. I have made it clear from the outset that I want
              people to respond to that consultation and to give their views on
              the Burns proposals. I have also invited people to suggest
              modifications and alternatives for consideration by my Department.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today I launched a video and other consultation
              materials as a vital aid to discussion. This is the most
              comprehensive consultation on any issue since the Assembly’s
              establishment. However, research by Prof Tony Gallagher, Prof Alan
              Smith, Save the Children and Prof Gardiner clearly states that new
              arrangements should not perpetuate the weaknesses that have been
              identified in their research. That is a danger.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the consultation is meaningful and
              real and offers a real opportunity for the entire community to
              have a say in future arrangements. We do not have a modern
              education system of which we can be proud. We must recognise that
              the arrangements put in place over 50 years ago were relevant to
              the last century. That system is not relevant to the needs of our
              children, be they from the Shankill Road, from the Bogside, from
              the Falls Road, from Ballymena or from Portadown. We must face
              that reality.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People must also face the crux issue of
              academic selection. We must confront the facts; only 2% of
              children from the Shankill Road have a grammar school education,
              and only 8% of children who attend grammar schools come from
              disadvantaged areas. Those are huge issues.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appeal to everybody, both in the Assembly and
              outside, not to become involved in conflict or division on this
              issue. Everyone has a duty and a responsibility to rise above
              that. This is about more than structures; it is about putting
              children at the centre of our thinking and establishing an
              education system that will allow them to believe in themselves and
              to succeed.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McHugh:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I
              agree with the Minister that we must focus on prioritising
              children. Putting children first, rather than putting them forward
              as failures at 11 years old, is the key to the debate. Does the
              Minister acknowledge that academic selection is, in fact, academic
              rejection for the majority of children?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M McGuinness: </b>Yes, I do. The reality is
              that academic selection for some children means academic rejection
              for many more.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moreover, research has shown that academic
              selection at age 11 prematurely closes down opportunities for the
              majority of pupils. It creates a sense of failure and results in a
              loss of self-esteem and confidence at a stage of their
              educational, social and emotional development when every
              encouragement should be given. Teachers have to work extremely
              hard to restore that loss.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should also understand that children are
              individuals whose educational development progresses at different
              rates. We recently heard that from Prof Gerry McKenna of the
              University of Ulster. He made a significant point, which is backed
              up by Prof George Bain, the vice- chancellor of Queen’s
              University. Only 50% of students come via A level to the new
              University of Ulster. Where do all the others come from? That is
              the big question. That clearly shows up the extra and incredible
              abilities of our young people. It is important that options are
              kept open until a child’s needs and aspirations have developed
              more fully.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have heard it suggested that the idea that
              every child can be a success is pie in the sky. On the contrary,
              every child can be a success. I have been in special education
              schools with autistic children, and it has done my heart proud to
              see a child on one day being able to count to six and on the next
              day to count to eight. That is how success must be measured.
              Children have different abilities, and unless we get our heads
              around that, and realise that our challenge is to provide an
              education system which opens doors for all of our children, we
              will always struggle against the backdrop of an education system
              that is not world class and which lags behind New Zealand, Korea
              and many other such countries.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sure that the people of the Shankill Road
              will be touched and pleased to hear about the Minister’s concern
              for their children’s future. It is a pity that he did not share
              that concern when his associates bombed their parents not so long
              ago.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How is the Minister’s consultation video to
              inform the debate on the issue of post-primary education? Eighty
              per cent of that video is directed towards the promotion of his
              party political point of view and of the Burns proposal.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Minister rejects academic selection, on
              what basis does he expect youngsters to be selected for
              oversubscribed schools? Is he in favour of social selection based
              on their parents’ ability to pay, their contacts, or their
              ability to buy a house in the proximity of the popular schools?</p>

              response form are to provide clear and objective information on
              the consultation arrangements and on the Burns proposals, to

              The video will be sent to schools, further education colleges and
              community groups, and it will act as an aid to discussion on the
              proposals. It will also be sent to public libraries and made
              available to the public.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The content of the video sets the context for

              to the weaknesses identified by the Gallagher and Smith research
              and the Save the Children research. The Burns proposals are
              explained, and answers are provided to frequently asked questions
              about them.</p>

              the document and about current arrangements.</p>

              post-primary education in order to stimulate discussion.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last week, a 10-and-a-half-year-old child
              uttered one of the most powerful statements that I have heard in
              the course of this debate. During the Save the Children research,
              she was asked what the 11-plus meant to her. Her words were more
              powerful than those of any adult who has articulated his or her
              views on selection. She said that if she passed, she would go to a
              smart school, but that if she failed, she would go to a stupid
              school. I rest my case.</p>

              funding for a new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner, and

              financial interest to keep it simply as a radiotherapy treatment
              centre. Moreover, given the waiting lists, to do so would take
              some of the pressure off the new cancer centre, which may or may
              not be open in 2005. Belvoir Park has a good reputation, and the
              new cancer centre will take time to develop. Does the Minister

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Campbell Report recommended that
              radiotherapy and chemotherapy services should be moved from
              Belvoir Park Hospital to Belfast City Hospital and become an
              integral part of the regional cancer centre. The report recognised
              that changes in treatment, together with the increasingly elderly
              population, will require clinicians to deal with people who are
              likely to be more ill and suffering from complex medical problems.
              Therefore, the report concluded that radiotherapy and chemotherapy
              services should be delivered in an acute hospital setting, where
              there is the full back-up of acute and diagnostic services. The
              relocation of radiotherapy and chemotherapy services from Belvoir
              Park to the City Hospital will give acutely ill cancer patients
              direct on-site access to general and specialist physicians and
              surgeons. For that reason, those services are better placed at the
              City Hospital site.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Pending the opening of the cancer centre, I am
              determined to ensure that cancer sufferers have the best possible
              treatment and care. I have made it clear that services at Belvoir
              Park are an important aspect of cancer treatment and that the
              hospital has an important and continuing role. I have underpinned
              current service provision by approving the acquisition of two
              linear accelerators at a capital cost of £3·8 million. I have
              also approved an investment of £550,000 for urgent remedial work
              to the building infrastructure and equipment at Belvoir Park, my
              officials are urgently considering the case for a replacement CT
              scanner for the hospital and I expect to announce the way forward
              soon.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The regional cancer centre is a keystone of the
              pattern of cancer services that I wish to develop. It is critical
              that we have a modern state-of-the-art facility, and it is my
              intention that that becomes a reality as soon as possible.
              Significant progress has been made on the Belfast City Hospital
              site. With regard to the cancer centre, I inherited a planned
              investment of some £32 million and a private finance initiative (PFI)
              process that had been set in motion by the previous
              Administration. Last year, the trusts and clinicians involved said
              that a state-of-the-art facility was needed that incorporated new
              and emerging technology and that advances made in patient care and
              treatment must be built on, so I had to decide whether the
              original proposal was adequate. The trusts and clinicians made the
              case that the rapid evolution of the concept of a cancer centre
              meant that the original proposal was no longer adequate. My
              Department and the Department of Finance and Personnel have now
              approved the revised business case at a cost of £57 million, and
              I will make an announcement on that before the summer recess.</p>

              levels in the service? What purpose do health boards serve other

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The ending of GP fundholding and the creation
              of local health and social care groups will not only allow local
              people to take local decisions about local services, it will also
              allow money to be moved from administration to front-line care. I
              anticipate that £2·5 million will be freed up and that money
              that was spent on administration will be spent on front-line care.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The wider structures will be addressed in

              recommendations made in the acute hospitals review group’s
              report and as part of the review of public administration. The
              continued existence of boards and trusts, how many there will be,
              what their functions will be and how other structures will fit in
              will be addressed in that context.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whatever emerges, it is important to ensure

              interconnection between health and social services, education,
              housing and other key public services is facilitated.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From the outset, I have ensured that the new
              local health and social care groups will be set up and operated in
              such a way as to be flexible enough to be accommodated within any
              wider structural changes in health and social services that emerge

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s response to our
              debate earlier today. Given that the majority of people being
              asked to serve on these new groups are from the health
              professions, can the Minister assure the House that these medical
              people will not be required to carry out clerical or
              administrative work to the detriment of ordinary patients?</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Compensating people for the time that they give
              to these boards will allow GPs and pharmacists, for example, to
              employ locum cover. That will ensure that they are able to carry
              out this work and that their other work will not suffer as a
              result. It is not my intention that anybody should be out of
              pocket because of these arrangements. I have put forward a figure
              of £3 per head for the management of these groups, and I will
              keep that under review.</p>

              the Minister answer the criticism that boards and trusts will
              dominate the management boards of new local health and social care
              groups?</p>
              <b>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Such fears have been expressed, but they were
              not borne out by the commissioning pilots, which also have board
              and trust managements on their boards, and on which the new groups
              have been based. Board and trust representatives will together
              fill only six of the 18 places on the management board, and GPs
              will fill five — so no one group or profession will dominate the
              new groups. Also, as part of their quota, boards and trusts must
              nominate a nurse, a social worker and a professional allied to
              medicine, which means that there will be two nurses, two social
              workers and two professionals allied to medicine on each group. In
              that regard, I point out that the generic term &quot;nurses&quot;
              refers to nurses, midwives and health visitors whose names are on
              the register of the United Kingdom Central Council for Nursing,
              Midwifery and Health Visiting (UKCC).</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The management boards of the groups must devise
              effective mechanisms to ensure the involvement of other
              stakeholders and members of the wider local health and social care
              group who are involved at the grass roots. It will be up to the
              management boards of the new groups to ensure that there is a
              bottom-up approach. I am confident that the management structure
              and representation on the boards are such that no group or
              profession will dominate. We now have a unique opportunity for
              primary care professionals and others, working at local level with
              local people, to have a way of ensuring that local people and
              primary care are at the centre of our health and social services.</p>

              she has failed — she has not grasped the waiting lists problem
              in the hospitals and the recent crisis in the Royal Victoria
              Hospital’s fracture wards. How many elective surgical procedures
              have been cancelled in all hospitals in Northern Ireland to date?</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The waiting lists question is not one that can
              be tackled in isolation from the broader pressures on hospital
              services, which have seen the number of emergency admissions
              rising steadily over the past year or so. Regarding capacity, the
              only cure is more resources. We need sustained long-term action,
              supported by the resources and the service capacity necessary to
              bring waiting lists down.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On efficiency, there is a significant programme
              of work under way to improve the flow of patients through the
              system. That includes reducing the number of people who fail to
              keep their appointments; putting in place alternatives to hospital
              admission, such as physiotherapists in the community treating
              patients with back pain; making sure theatres are operating at
              maximum capacity; and validating lists to ensure that they are
              accurate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In spite of our difficulties, three out of four
              people get treatment within three months, and 95% of those people
              are treated within a year. Not all the same people are waiting at
              the same time. The people on the waiting lists are constantly
              changing.</p>

              emergency pressure on beds, what measures is the Minister

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The service will be asked to increase the level
              of protected elective capacity during the next year — units that
              will not be affected by pressures. Altnagelvin Hospital already
              has a good model in place with doctors performing approximately
              1,000 procedures a year. Some of the recommendations in the acute
              hospitals review group’s report also mentioned that point, so it
              will be included in the Executive’s discussion about proposals
              for the way forward in wider acute service provision. As well as
              that, an extra 1,000 community care places will be available next
              year, which will help to reduce the number of people in hospital,
              thus freeing up hospital capacity for operations.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition to the points that I have outlined
              in my answer to the previous Member, 262 patients have been
              offered the opportunity to have cardiac surgery in Glasgow or
              elsewhere this year rather than wait for treatment locally. For
              example, the Northern Health and Social Services Board hopes that
              51 patients will be treated in Scotland by the end of March, which
              would deal with all the board’s excess.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Royal Group of Hospitals has confirmed that
              by the end of March doctors there will have completed more than
              700 procedures. The Western Health and Social Services Board has
              held additional ophthalmology clinics at Roe Valley Hospital,
              reducing the number of waiting inpatients from 360 to 30 and thus
              reducing the average waiting time from two years to six months.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ward 8 in the Royal Victoria Hospital has been
              re- organised as an elective surgery ward for six months of the
              year and as an emergency admissions ward for the other six months.
              A mobile magnetic resonance imaging unit was brought in to provide
              a scanning service to help the Northern and Western boards reduce
              waiting lists there. Additional scanning capacity from a mobile
              unit is also available at the Royal Victoria Hospital. Those are
              some of the specific actions that have been taken to help
              individual patients — who did not have to wait as long as they
              otherwise might have had to.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I outlined earlier the type of work that is
              under way to improve the flow of patients through the system. Of
              course, with regard to asking and pleading for extra resources, we
              cannot carry out the work unless the service has the beds, staff,
              equipment and theatre time. To reduce waiting lists we need
              sustained long-term action supported by resources and the
              necessary service capacity.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People who sustain fractures are first assessed
              at an accident and emergency department to determine whether they
              require surgery at a main fracture centre. If they do, they are
              transferred to one of the fracture units at the Royal Victoria,
              the Ulster or Altnagelvin hospitals. I am assured that
              arrangements are in place to ensure that as far as possible
              everyone who is assessed as requiring inpatient fracture surgery
              is transferred to a main fracture centre as soon as possible and
              within 48 hours at the latest. All patients who are admitted
              either directly to a main fracture centre or are transferred from
              a local hospital are clinically assessed at a main fracture
              centre, and treatment is prioritised accordingly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is clearly not acceptable that some people
              must wait a long time for this treatment. Our fracture services
              have been under sustained pressure for some time as a result of an
              increased demand for surgery, coupled with a shortage of
              specialist staff, such as anaesthetists and orthopaedic surgeons
              both here and in the NHS. I have outlined the ongoing work. In
              addition, in planning for the present and the future, my
              Department has afforded a high priority to training in this
              speciality. Specifically, the number of trainees in orthopaedics
              has increased by almost 50% in the past five years, and further
              increases are planned.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes, unfortunately, our fracture services have
              been under sustained pressure for some time. Although every effort
              is made to minimise the impact on other services, the nature of
              trauma and fracture injuries is such that urgent surgery is often
              required. Regrettably, that has resulted in the cancellation of
              some elective orthopaedic surgery.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is great excitement in the House today,
              because it looks as if we are going to get past question 7. With
              questions to the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public
              Safety, that must be a record.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In spite of the debates this morning and the
              questions so far, I am still not clear what has gone wrong, given
              that all the royal colleges and medical professionals are at odds
              with the Minister’s plan for primary care groups. Will the
              Minister tell us what has gone wrong with the consultation, or has
              she decided to take on the royal colleges as a test of strength?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms de Brún:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If anyone is deciding to take on anyone else in
              a test of strength, the Member may want to look closer to home
              than to ask the question of me. It is certainly not my intention
              to do anything of the sort. I have talked to many groups, as has
              my Department. I detailed in the debate earlier the long programme
              of consultation and meetings that I have had with groups — as
              late as today.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Within a week of receiving a letter asking for
              a meeting with the British Medical Association, the Royal College
              of Nursing and the Royal College of Midwives, I agreed to meet
              those groups. The letter arrived on 7 March, and I have said that
              I will meet them on Wednesday of this week. There is no question
              but that I have spoken in detail and have sent out detailed
              guidance. That guidance has also been given to Committee members,
              some of whom have contradicted what was written in the guidance in
              television and radio interviews, saying that certain things would
              not happen when they were clearly written in the guidance.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I am attempting, yet again today, to
              ensure that I address people’s concerns by telling them that the
              services of the GP fundholders will be maintained until local
              health and social care groups have had a chance to make their
              decisions about them. I expect the professional delivery of those
              services to continue and the £3 per head that I referred to
              previously to be sufficient for the management costs. I will look
              at that, and I am prepared to keep it under review.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There will be very few, if any, redundancies,
              and given the management structure of the groups, no individual
              profession will dominate them. The arrangements for the new groups
              are based on the proposals set out in the consultation document
              ‘Building the Way Forward in Primary Care’, which received
              widespread support. The configuration of the groups has been
              announced, and action has been taken by boards to ensure that
              management boards are established by April.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are gathering considerable experience in the
              application of public-private partnerships to ensure the delivery
              of infrastructural developments and public sector services. In
              that context, it was important to carry out the review that has
              recently taken place. Whatever options are chosen, it is essential
              that the use of public-private partnerships to deliver public
              services, where appropriate, must be affordable, deliver value for
              money and provide effective solutions that meet the needs of our
              public services in the public interest. In that sense, the use of
              public-private partnerships is not ideologically driven. Their use
              is only one way of dealing with the real needs of our public
              services. I trust that that summary of the general criteria will
              indicate the basis upon which public-private partnerships can be
              used to help meet our objectives with regard to our public
              services and the infrastructures they require.</p>

              require policy formulation and direction before detailed option
              analysis can be carried out.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our policy decisions would be better framed in
              the light of comments from all interested parties. I have,
              therefore, given approval for the Department of Finance and
              Personnel to issue, for public consultation, an interim report on
              the accommodation review. That report is available to Members

              the various issues raised in the comments that are received.
              Therefore it would be reasonable to expect consultants to issue

              announcement that the interim report is to be issued today. Does
              he acknowledge that, in considering the relocation of Civil
              Service functions, he must consider the cost implications, such as
              new travel costs, the efficiencies and overall costs for the new
              Civil Service locations? Will he bear in mind that the contents of
              his written replies to questions posed by me clearly show that
              Larne, Carrickfergus and Newtownabbey have a lower percentage of
              Civil Service jobs than Londonderry, Omagh and Strabane, which lie

              The recommendations must be set in the context of what is feasible

              considering the Barnett formula and its relationship with the 2002
              spending review. However, my officials are in regular contact to

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been much speculation about the

              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Farren:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When it comes to such matters, it becomes an
              Executive position rather than a personal position of the Minister
              of Finance and Personnel or any other Minister. However, Members
              will accept that now is not the time to state publicly all that we
              have in mind for the forthcoming negotiations with the Treasury.
              The Department of Finance and Personnel is determined to seek a
              fair and appropriate outcome to the 2002 spending review. The case
              will be pressed at the highest levels.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Public expenditure allocations to, and
              consequent spending within, Northern Ireland should be based on a
              fair and objective analysis of our needs. The key issue is the
              extent to which the Barnett formula addresses that. The Department
              has undertaken a detailed and rigorous scrutiny of the Barnett
              formula to examine carefully whether it currently meets our needs
              sufficiently and, more importantly, whether it will do so in the
              future. We cannot accept a situation where the provision for
              priority services such as health, education and transport is
              markedly less favourable than in England. That appears to be the
              consequence of the Barnett formula as it is currently interpreted
              and applied. For that reason the Department has undertaken a
              rigorous scrutiny of the formula, and our anticipated allocations
              as they are currently constructed, during the spending review.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can the Minister confirm that there may be
              risks as well as opportunities related to the review of the
              Barnett formula? How is he maximising the opportunities and
              minimising the risks associated with that?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Farren:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I made a statement to the House last week on
              the timetable for the Budget, which included indications of the
              staging of the process with regard to the spending review. I made
              the point that it was not a no-risk process to address, in however
              detailed a manner, the Barnett formula and the outcomes from its
              application to our spending needs.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department has been engaged in a needs and
              effectiveness evaluation across several Departments in order to
              test the extent to which current allocations meet the needs of
              those Departments. The six Departments under evaluation spend
              approximately 70% of the total public expenditure for which the
              Department of Finance and Personnel is responsible. Therefore, a
              good picture will emerge of how well current allocations under the
              Barnett formula enable us to meet needs and how effectively we use
              allocations. That is a large task in our preparations to address
              the Barnett formula with the Treasury and how it will be used to
              determine our allocations under the current spending review.</p>

              instead of the mandatory retirement age of 60, which is currently

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue of the retirement age for senior
              civil servants was included in the review at the request of my
              predecessor, Mark Durkan. As I am just about to receive the
              review, I have not had the opportunity to consider what it may
              recommend about the age of retirement, and so I am not in a
              position to answer the Member’s question. When the report of the
              review has been received, that issue, along with others, will be
              fully addressed. Whether we take the matter forward on its own, or
              as part of the other recommendations that the review report is
              likely to contain, remains to be decided upon. However, I can
              assure the Member that the review team has positively addressed

              recommendations is a commitment in the current Programme for
              Government. Exactly how they will be taken forward will depend on
              the nature of the recommendations and any views expressed during
              the subsequent consultation. Once the way forward is agreed, I
              anticipate that an action plan will be developed, and the views of
              the Committee for Finance and Personnel will be taken. I will be

              review of Civil Service staff, which will, no doubt, affect other
              staff, does the Minister intend to move senior staff in some
              Departments outside of Belfast? Will he consider the movement of
              such staff and Departments to Fermanagh where there is currently
              ideal office accommodation available in the Lisnaskea area? That
              area has lost many jobs recently.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The question is allied to an earlier one. I
              will answer it in the same terms. When and if we come to the
              relocation of sections of the Civil Service, it will not simply be
              a matter of relocating members of the senior Civil Service or
              deciding whether to relocate to County Fermanagh, a county of
              considerable natural beauty. I am sure that many civil servants
              would be only too delighted to work and perhaps live there. The
              qualities of Fermanagh — not just its natural beauty but also
              the facilities that it can provide — will be fully considered,
              along with those of the areas that his party Colleague Mr Ken
              Robinson drew my attention to. He would have described those areas

              were supposed to receive a response to the question in July 2001
              and then in February 2002. Now we are being told that the
              Executive will meet, but we do not know when that will happen, or
              what the outcome will be. Some people have lost out because of the
              delay, and more people will lose out if decisions are not made
              quickly. Will there be compensation for those people, and will it
              be backdated?</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member raises an interesting point. In
              answer to the first part of his question, when reviews are
              established they are often expected to be completed quickly.
              However, sometimes that expectation is not realised, because the
              issues turn out to be complex, and a variety of views must be
              considered in depth. I have been impressed by the work of the
              review team under Lord Ouseley, whom I had the pleasure of
              meeting. He gave me a progress report on the work of the review
              team several months ago. The complexity of the issues struck me
              forcibly at that time. It is far better to have a full,
              comprehensive report that addresses all of the issues, than one
              that is completed solely to try to meet a deadline. I accept that
              the deadline was set with the expectation that it would be met.
              However, we will have a full and comprehensive report.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I fail to understand what lies behind the
              second part of the Member’s question about compensation. I have
              not had an opportunity to consider that issue, nor has my
              attention been drawn to any matter for which compensation might be
              sought. If, when the review is published, the Member has concerns
              about compensation relevant to the work of the review that he
              feels must be addressed, he should draw that to my attention and
              the attention of the Executive.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is difficult to determine how many people
              can benefit from the Help with Rates campaign. Housing benefit
              applications received from the Rate Collection Agency show a
              downward trend. In 1999-2000, for example, the agency received
              just over 68,000 applications. This year fewer than 60,000
              applications have been received. The current Help with Rates
              campaign was launched in the light of that downward trend, so that
              owner-occupiers would be fully aware of their entitlement to
              housing benefit, which is administered by the Rate Collection
              Agency on their behalf.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Information suggests that approximately 80% of
              the applications are successful. However, that percentage can vary
              from year to year because of changing circumstances. The benefit
              is led by demand. The agency’s Help with Rates awareness
              campaign seeks to inform homeowners with low incomes that they may

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The cost of upkeep of all property affects
              their market rental values and is, therefore, reflected in their
              net annual value. The new valuation list currently being prepared
              will come into force on 1 April 2003. It will redistribute the
              rate burden of non-domestic ratepayers. Broadly speaking, sectors
              and locations that have fared well since the last revaluation in
              1997 should, all things being equal, find a corresponding
              reduction in rate liability to the extent that any downturn is

              Agriculture and Rural Development and the Executive to consider

              </font></b><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fact that this debate is required suggests
              a lack of feeling, of which farmers are aware, on the part of the
              Department of Agriculture and Rural Development for Northern
              Ireland’s agriculture industry. Minister Rodgers claims to
              understand the difficulties that farmers face and claims to
              sympathise with them. Sympathy is simply not enough, and practical
              solutions seem to be a distant prospect. That is why I do not
              hesitate to support the motion.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Calls for an early retirement scheme are not a
              new phenomenon. In the difficult past few years, numerous
              spokespersons on agriculture have called for such a scheme. Many
              have gone further and added the obvious accompaniment of a fund
              for new entrants. The reasons for that are obvious to everyone
              except the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the average age of a farmer is 57, and only
              7% of farmers are aged under 30, it does not take an enormous
              stretch of the imagination to make an informed guess on where
              farming is going — the Province’s primary industry is heading
              for extinction unless we attract young people back into the
              business. That can only be done by instilling confidence in young
              people that there is a future in farming.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The chances are that an 18-year-old with the
              opportunity to take any kind of job outside farming will do so.
              Banks will not assist young people, and the Department is
              indifferent to the plight of young people who wish to carry on,
              let alone develop, a family business. We must pave the way for the
              older generation of farmers to retire to make way for young
              people, who must be given the resources to become involved in
              farming.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We hear so much about the size of farms. There
              is no better way to increase the unit size of a farm than to
              introduce an early retirement scheme alongside a new entrants
              scheme. To decide that such schemes would not constitute value for
              money is a short-term view of the situation, and one that I
              suspect is based on a study that is distinct from the
              circumstances in Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask the Minister of Agriculture and Rural
              Development to consider carefully the options for funding such
              schemes, if she has not already done so. So much is made of the
              impending increase in membership of the European Union, the
              effects of globalisation on commodity prices for farm produce and
              the strategic purchase of produce by processors in the Province
              that the chance for farmers to succeed appears negligible. Unless
              all possible action is taken, our industry will not have a
              sporting chance of success. It will be doomed from the outset.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If given a reasonable chance, Northern Ireland’s
              farmers can respond to the challenge. The beef export embargoes of
              the last seven years have proved their resolve. The Department and
              the Government must serve the farming industry by shaking off a
              negative and defeatist mentality and setting about the proactive
              development of a recovery strategy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McHugh:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I
              welcome this debate. There have been several debates on
              agriculture in the Assembly, and those with no particular interest
              in agriculture will say that this is more of the same. However,
              the industry needs support, together with a great deal of thought
              and discussion. The debate on the future, or the extinction, of
              agriculture is, therefore, timely and vital, and I have no
              difficulty in supporting the motion.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The difficulty is in trying to find either a
              retirement scheme or a mixed retirement and loans system, as has
              been suggested. I have some concern about the use of loans. There
              is a place for a capital grant scheme to encourage young people
              into farming. On examining the South’s attempt at a retirement
              scheme, we find that almost half of the applications came from
              larger farms and not from the targeted group who would have
              benefited from the scheme. It did little for the restructuring of
              farming and for making a difference to the industry by bringing
              people into it. Will such a scheme make a difference here? All
              those things must be taken on board.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Agriculture and Rural
              Development’s vision document says that there will always be
              farmers and farming. That is debatable. There may be neither if
              the current situation is not resolved. Young people are not coming
              into the industry. They look at their peers and see that they will
              be economically much better off in one of the many jobs now
              available, such as construction work. Those factors come into the
              equation. People do not stay in farming, and older farmers have no
              extra help. High employment levels and the money available outside
              farming work against keeping the agriculture industry at its
              former standard. There have been changes in the last five years.
              The industry has been damaged by BSE and other food scares.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sustainable agriculture should be about meeting
              current needs without compromising the ability of future
              generations to meet theirs. Social and economic sustainability
              within the rural community could be another way to look at the
              matter. Perhaps we should pay farmers for jobs other than food
              production, such as looking after the countryside. If we have only
              large farms, will the rural areas be properly taken care of? Will
              people from the lowlands, for example, be prepared to farm in
              severely disadvantaged areas? I do not believe that they will.
              Only people who come from such areas will be prepared to live and
              work in them, so the idea of changing structures to such an extent
              will probably not work.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Returns on farming are critical. If milk
              production does not wash its own face, it will fail, as did small-
              scale pig production in places such as Fermanagh several years
              ago. When those farms’ inputs became greater than their returns,
              they were closed down. There is a possibility that that will
              happen to all elements of agriculture over the next few years. If
              we do not do something, there will no be farms here, and we will
              have to import everything.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The farming infrastructure is critical. Farming
              has been decimated; it is in decline; and there is waste. Farmers
              face environmental demands, and they are also under pressure to
              retrain and get different skills. Furthermore, animal welfare
              concerns must be incorporated into farming. The Government do not
              provide support or capital for farmers to deal with any of those
              pressures. It is very expensive to maintain the infrastructure of
              a farm, and that must be dealt with or everyone will leave
              farming, and that is the last thing that we want to happen.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP)
              is on the top of everyone’s agenda with regard to the direction
              of policies and world demands. Grassland has been expanded in
              places such as Brazil and Argentina to create beef production
              methods. The environmental impact of that is immense. In places
              such as Argentina, 30% of the gross domestic product (GDP) was
              beef production or agriculture. However, such countries still went
              bankrupt. They based their outputs on the lowest sourcing and the
              lowest labour costs, but it did not work. Is that the direction
              that we should be taking? Those countries were able to work with
              cheap resources, such as cheaper pesticides — which they used a
              great deal of — and had very little or no concern for animal
              welfare.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a growing worldwide demand for food.
              International trade has been liberalised, and there has been EU
              enlargement. The notion that expanded globalisation is sustainable
              is nonsense. Some 13% of all air freight is food. Food, including
              vegetables and fruit, such as strawberries, is the largest
              category of air freight. A kilogram of apples has been known to
              produce at least its own weight in fuel emissions. What is the
              cost to the world, and to farming on a global scale, of the
              removal of rainforests to create grassland? That is happening in
              countries where the greatest benefit is to be had from maintaining
              the original environment. The demand for low-cost food, at the
              lowest possible prices, benefits only multinational giants. That
              situation cannot be sustained. We need a more localised market,
              which is where organic farming comes into its own. I note that the
              German Federal Minister of Consumer Protection, Food and
              Agriculture supports organic farming methods and wants more money
              to be invested in them. Farming and the environment have to be
              taken as a whole.</p>

              constituency with a large farming community, I am only too aware
              that agriculture is in decline and has been for years.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some years ago I was a member of the
              Agriculture Committee in the Northern Ireland Forum for Political
              Dialogue. I gained some insight into the industry’s problems
              through visits to the Forum from representatives from every sector
              in the industry. Unfortunately, the situation has gone downhill
              since then. We must act now to generate a viable agriculture
              industry for Northern Ireland before it is too late.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The timing of the motion is somewhat premature,
              given that a statement may be pending from the Minister in
              response to the Department’s vision group’s report. Surely it
              would have been more productive to have waited for the Minister’s
              formal response and any unique proposals or suggestions that she
              may have. Perhaps the Minister will give some indication of her
              thinking in her response. I pay credit to Ms Rodgers. As Minister
              of Agriculture and Rural Development, she was thrown in at the
              deep end. She has represented Northern Ireland well not only in
              agriculture but also in her other duties, including the fishing
              industry, despite being constrained by European legislation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will highlight some specific issues that the
              Alliance Party hopes to hear more about in the Minister’s
              response. The Alliance Party shares the desire to have a dynamic,
              long-term and prosperous future for Northern Ireland’s agrifood
              sector. Of particular interest are: the need to protect and
              enhance animal health status; the strengthening of the rural
              economy through all farming activities, including those that
              involve beef, crops, milk and so on; and the safeguarding of our
              land-based heritage and rural developments.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I draw the Minister’s attention to the
              anxiety of farmers and landowners in the Strangford constituency.
              The Department of the Environment has designated the coastline of
              the outer Ards Peninsula and the east coast of the Irish Sea as
              areas of special scientific interest (ASSIs). Farmers and
              landowners regard that as a removal of their long-held and
              long-enjoyed rights, an additional worry that farmers could well
              do without. Perhaps the Minister’s response will give some
              relief to those landowners and farmers.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members referred to an early retirement scheme
              that could be offered to those who have served the agriculture
              industry well over the years, and who choose, at this stage, to
              hang up their wellington boots. Members also referred to the
              development of an early entrants scheme that would allow young
              farmers to become involved in the industry in the hope that they
              would enjoy a good, prosperous future.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I look forward to hearing the Minister address
              the vision group’s findings that a climate of mistrust and
              hostility exists in parts of the food chain. There appears to be a
              lack of synergy among producers, processors and retailers. I would
              like to know to what degree the Minister endorses the
              recommendation of the vision group’s report on that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The recent arrival of multinationals in
              Northern Ireland has had a detrimental effect on our local food
              producers and has resulted in an enormous change in demand.
              Furthermore, Europe’s dictation of food specification — size,
              shape, colour and so on — has had a huge impact on producers,
              has placed enormous stress and strain on all local producers and
              has caused many farmers to pack it in altogether.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Obviously, protecting and enhancing our animal
              health status is of the utmost importance, and, in this regard, I
              am sure that the Minister agrees that we need to place urgent
              priority on tackling brucellosis and tuberculosis.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to strengthening the rural economy,
              the Alliance Party would emphasise the whole rural economy, which
              extends beyond agriculture to include non-farming activities, and
              I am sure that the Minister will agree. Specifically, the vision
              group’s report recommends the establishment of a rural baseline
              as a rural proofing benchmark, and that is much needed — indeed,
              it is overdue.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Among the group’s other recommendations aimed
              at safeguarding our land-based heritage and rural environment are
              the promotion and development of good farming practice throughout
              Northern Ireland and the implementation of the recommendations of
              our biodiversity strategy. I understand that both those actions
              require grant aid to be successful. Will the Minister commit
              adequate financial resources to realise these objectives?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Every person in Northern Ireland has a duty to
              support local agriculture. Our slogan should be &quot;Buy the good
              Northern Irish products&quot;. Not only would that help to produce
              the best food and products, it would also help the industry remain
              one of our major employers. Although we all wish to support
              agriculture, it is certainly disappointing when the antics of some
              people in Ballymena threaten the whole industry because some
              people wish to use a few hours on a Sunday afternoon to promote
              their good work. Obstacles do not support proclamations of 100%
              support for agriculture, and 100% support should mean exactly
              that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I acknowledge that the Minister has yet to make
              her formal reply to the vision group’s report, but I look
              forward to her addressing the matters I have raised. Will the
              Minister assure me that she will incorporate my party’s specific
              concerns in her formal reply to the report?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland has lots of capacity to
              produce good quality food, and in view of the enormous number of
              people in our world who are starving today, it would be remiss of
              me not to ask why someone in authority cannot come up with some
              way of using all our land to produce food and have it despatched
              to those areas where people are starving to death? The Western
              World could do more to feed the starving. I support the motion.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Douglas:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr Savage for bringing this motion to
              the Floor today. The agriculture industry has been in a state of
              flux over the past few years — indeed, since BSE reared its ugly
              head in 1996. Since then we have had price cuts in all
              commodities, and with Northern Ireland’s industry being mainly
              grass-based, these cuts have been most severe with beef, sheep and
              milk.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I know that the Minister is considering the
              findings of the vision group’s report and that she hopes to
              report soon on the measures she wishes to take forward. I have
              some difficulties with this, as there will not be enough finance
              to take forward all that she would like to take forward. My fear
              is that much more finance is needed than will be there.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not want to be seen as not supporting the
              retirement scheme, which other Members have raised, but the
              finance required will not be forthcoming. What is needed is more
              assistance for people who want to remain in, or enter, the
              industry. In my reply to the vision document consultation I asked
              for a new entrants scheme to create a larger proportion of farmers
              under the age of 45. This could be managed in conjunction with a
              low-cost loan system to enable younger farmers to acquire land or
              expand their business base. Also, there would be merit in awarding
              higher rates of grant to young farmers for repairs and
              environmental schemes.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Modulation money, which is increasing this
              year, could be used to fund this on a Northern Ireland basis.
              Rationalisation in the farming sector — as has happened over the
              years — is inevitable, whether we like it or not, so we must
              ensure adequate advisory and financial support so that new and
              existing farmers can remain viable in an ever more competitive
              environment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must not forget that if farmers were not
              caring for the countryside we would not see that patchwork quilt
              when coming back on a plane. We would have an unkept jungle, which
              would please the eyes of few, and we would have to rely on foreign
              food. I agree with Graham Wynn, chief executive of the Royal
              Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), who said at a recent
              conference that farming should become part of the solution for
              environmental improvements and not be an environmental problem.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland has a very good
              environmentally sensitive areas scheme, and there has been a very
              good uptake by farmers. However, it has been a victim of its own
              success. Although the main scheme has progressed, and farmers
              continue to be paid for various measures, the enhancement plan
              element of the scheme has been shut since 1 April 1999 because of
              insufficient funds to meet demand. At one time the Department
              lauded the scheme as the jewel in the crown.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This enhancement plan element provided farmers
              with more than just money to carry out environmental improvements.
              It also provided off-farm employment for farmers with small farms.
              They could develop small businesses to assist the environmental
              services. In my constituency the scheme provided a boost to
              off-farm income and made the area more attractive to tourists,
              thus providing another stream of income. As the scheme is partly
              funded by the European Commission, Northern Ireland receives
              additional money. I again call on the Minister to reinstate a
              proper financially managed scheme as soon as possible, because the
              Department’s lack of financial management caused the closure.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also need a scheme to upgrade existing
              slurry and effluent facilities on farms. Money for this should
              come from the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development and
              the Department of the Environment, because they jointly police
              environmental issues.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A can of worms could be opened in the light of
              the Department of the Environment’s revisiting the issue of
              nitrate-vulnerable zones. I agree with the president of the Ulster
              Farmers’ Union, who said at the weekend in ‘Farming Life’
              that any new zones must be based on science alone. If we are to
              have further restrictions on the disposal of farm waste and
              effluent, there must be a grant to allow farmers to upgrade as
              necessary. No farmer wants to see pollution, but if repairs or the
              expansion necessary to meet proposed measurements cannot be
              funded, production must cease, and that is precisely what we do
              not want.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Member who spoke earlier mentioned farmers
              hanging up their boots. A farmer never hangs up his boots, but he
              needs a reasonable return to survive and protect the environment.
              I am not sure that I agree with Mr McCarthy’s statement about
              Ballymena. I am opposed to that. Good work is done on Sunday, so I
              cannot agree with Mr McCarthy’s sentiments.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I conclude by calling on the Minister to press
              Margaret Beckett hard to claim the final tranche of agrimoney
              compensation from the EU, which could be given to farmers.
              Although it is only a small amount, it is, nevertheless, a
              significant amount to individual farmers, and they are entitled to
              the money. If the British Government had paid UK farmers all the
              agrimoney compensation that they were entitled to in recent years,
              the industry would be in a better position to compete on a level
              playing field. I urge the Minister to use every opportunity in the
              next weeks to lobby for this compensation. I support the motion.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate my Colleague, George Savage, for
              moving the motion on making farming and the food industry more
              economically sustainable.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Agriculture and the various stages of food
              processing represent around one tenth of regional gross domestic
              product (GDP). According to some definitions, it is clearly our
              most important economic sector. Given that, it is appropriate for
              those of us who do not represent agricultural constituencies to
              comment on the motion.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.30 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support George Savage, especially on the
              early retirement proposals. There are no easy solutions. The right
              policy for agriculture demands recognition of the external factors
              that bear down on the Minister of Agriculture and Rural
              Development and her counterparts in Edinburgh, Cardiff, London and
              Dublin.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first external factor is that the common
              agricultural policy (CAP) cannot remain in its present form. That
              now seems to be universally accepted. It still takes up half of
              the European Commission’s budget. The European Union is about to
              be enlarged, which, in itself, is a good thing. The levels of GDP
              per head in the countries concerned are around one quarter of our
              own. Farming accounts for around one tenth to one fifth of their
              total labour forces, compared to roughly 5% here. Clearly, the CAP
              in its current form cannot simply be extended to central and
              eastern Europe.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since the founding of the European Economic
              Community in 1957, the CAP has operated by keeping European
              consumer food prices — the prices that we all pay when we go
              into the shops to buy food — well above world levels. It has
              become obvious to commentators across Europe that that is not a
              cost-effective way of maintaining rural incomes, nor is it now
              sustainable. It also goes against the historic approach to food
              policy in the United Kingdom. For example, from the end of the
              Corn Laws in the 1840s through to the Great Depression of the
              1930s, the UK had a policy of free trade and cheap food.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That was then followed, from the second world
              war to accession to the Common Market in 1973, by the so-called
              deficiency payment system. This system was able to deliver farming
              support in a more cost-effective manner than the common
              agricultural policy. It may well be that in the future as the CAP
              is dismantled, elements of a deficiency-based system may have to
              be, and should be, restored.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second external factor under which the
              Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development operates is the
              gradual move to global free trade in farm products. Slowly, but
              probably irreversibly, the three main world trade blocs in farming
              — the United States, Japan and the European Union — are
              beginning to reduce their heavy subsidisation of consumer
              agricultural prices. That is a good thing to the extent that the
              way that agriculture has been supported in the rich economies has
              often acted to the detriment of the poorer countries, notably in
              Africa.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Annual aid to the Third World from the
              so-called northern economies amounts to around $50 billion.
              However, the current level of total agricultural support in Japan,
              the EU and the United States amounts to six or seven times that
              — $350 billion a year. That is a strange imbalance, and Mr
              McCarthy rightly referred to global hunger. If the ongoing Doha
              World Trade Organisation round is successful in freeing up food
              and textile trade, that could increase the total GDP of the world’s
              poorer countries by around $1,500 billion — $1·5 trillion —
              by 2015 and lift an extra 320 million people out of dire poverty.
              Clearly, that is desirable.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In summary, we must move to a more diversified
              and self-sustaining economy in our rural areas. That is the
              implication of the global constraints under which agriculture here
              operates. That would be to the good of all in Northern Ireland,
              and it would also benefit the poorer parts of the world, whether
              that be Poland and Hungary in central and eastern Europe or
              various parts of Africa.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Savage’s motion points in the right
              direction. The House of Commons Agriculture Committee is studying
              farming policy in various countries, most notably New Zealand,
              where a radical approach has been taken over the past two decades.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We cannot be like Canute. The tide is moving
              against the farming policy that operated in the 1970s and 1980s,
              and we cannot go back to that. I support the motion and its
              innovative ideas.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGrady:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is with some trepidation that I follow the
              erudition of Dr Birnie on the macroeconomics of farming and the
              global track on which he led us. It was a fascinating and
              interesting trip. However, he distilled the whole subject when he
              said that we must achieve a recovery for the farming community and
              achieve sustainable viability in farming. I think that was the
              crux of his message.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have some difficulty in speaking to this
              motion because it urges the Minister of Agriculture and Rural
              Development to do something. The Minister does not require urging;
              she has been in a very urgent mode since the outbreak of
              foot-and-mouth disease. However, a motion asking us to consider
              implementation measures for sustaining viability should have had
              more examples of what Mr Savage wants the House, the Department
              and the Executive to do. Many Members took their cause, or their
              exercise as we said at school, from the ‘Vision for the Future
              of the Agri-food Industry’. I could easily list headings from
              the Executive summary, but that would add nothing to the debate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie said that the gross domestic produce
              (GDP) of agriculture is one tenth of the economic contribution in
              Northern Ireland. In my constituency, as in others, it is much
              greater. Our rural community depends on the viability and
              profitability of the farming industry, and we require a radical
              view. I was pleased when I read the ‘Vision for the Future of
              the Agri-food Industry’ and even more pleased with the response
              from the Ulster Farmers’ Union. The recommendations scored 99
              out of 100; it is no mean achievement for representatives of the
              farming community to agree 99% with the Department of Agriculture
              and Rural Development. That gives us a blueprint for progress.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can only emphasise one or two aspects of the
              problems we face in the aftermath of BSE and of foot-and-mouth
              disease. One obvious and uncontroversial objective should be to
              improve the control of animal disease and traceability along with
              the introduction of disease insurance. These require an
              all-Ireland mechanism and the concentration of both Governments.
              It is unfortunate that the irrational outburst of the leader of
              the UUP may make that more difficult, and that would be to the
              detriment of the farming industry. I hope that the common sense
              that prevails in the farming community will prevail in politics
              and will enable us to continue to address those all-Ireland
              requirements to sustain our farming and livestock.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been an enormous increase in bovine
              tuberculosis in many constituencies. I have mentioned that disease
              many times and urge the Minister to address the problem. I also
              want to emphasise the need for a review of the food chain concept
              to investigate the direction of profitability from producer to
              consumer. One or two studies have found the supermarkets &quot;not
              guilty&quot;. I would rather employ the Scottish legal phrase
              &quot;not proven&quot;. That should be looked at again.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The concept of less favoured areas, of which my
              constituency has a considerable proportion, should be allowed to
              continue with increased or modernised funding and the maintenance
              of the 90% safety net for at least another year.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have all spoken of the need to restructure
              the farming industry. I am pleased to see that the schemes that we
              have discussed in the House are well articulated in the vision
              document, which was published by the Department and endorsed by
              the Ulster Farmers’ Union. The most important of those schemes
              is the agricultural restructuring scheme. Its aim is to
              restructure those aspects of farming that were not delivering
              viability, profitability and sustainability.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also an enthusiastic supporter of the land
              management contract scheme. I know that it is a difficult scheme,
              but it looks at farming in its entirety — agricultural
              production, the custodial relationship of the farmer to the
              environment and the social requirement to sustain a rural
              community. Those three things can best be achieved by a broad land
              management contract scheme.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The other aspect of modernisation is education
              and training. Our farming sector needs easy access to modern
              information, techniques and scientific interests. A one-stop shop
              is needed to facilitate a community that, at its grass roots, is
              not given to innovation. It must look again, as Dr Birnie said, at
              what the market requires. We have to move away from the European
              Union policy of rewarding quantity to a policy that rewards
              quality. I spoke to a farmer recently who deplored the fact that
              good quality strains of animals, be they beef or sheep, were
              rapidly disappearing from our countryside and needed to be
              sustained by paying for quality and not quantity.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be interesting if all the parties in
              the House could adopt a unanimous approach to the issue. They
              should publish their responses to the vision document so that we
              all can read them. The fact that the consultation period ended
              some weeks ago does not indicate a lack of urgency. With that
              simple caveat, I support the motion on the clear understanding
              that &quot;diversity&quot;, &quot;profitability&quot; and
              &quot;sustainability&quot; are the key words.</p>

              the motion. If the Minister were not doing what it says in the
              motion she would have no position to fill. The agriculture
              industry needs significant support and some rational and
              innovative thinking to get out of its current situation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is regrettable that those issues arise time
              and again, and many of the same issues are repeated because of the
              nature of the problems in agriculture.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the worst affected areas is the dairy
              industry, which, up until now, has got away lightly compared with
              the beef, sheep and pig sectors. The dairy industry has been one
              of the hardest hit, with milk prices at around 16p per litre. That
              price cannot be sustained, and dairy farmers cannot withstand it
              for any length of time. One of the main problems for the dairy
              industry is debt levels. Beef and sheep farmers could not borrow
              large amounts of money from the bank, unless they were large
              operations. However, dairy farmers had the additional collateral
              of milk quota. Therefore banks allowed many dairy farmers to
              borrow six-figure sums. They anticipated that the situation would
              remain good for a considerable time. Unfortunately the most recent
              downturn has created a situation in which that is not the case.
              Dairy farming is in a predicament, and many people have a high
              level of debt. It cannot meet that debt if that situation
              continues.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask the Minister to consider cereal farming,
              which, in the past three or four years, has been going through a
              difficult period. The Ulster Farmers’ Union has put forward
              sensible suggestions on arable aid payments and on how a deal can
              be done with the rest of the United Kingdom. The suggestion is
              that there would be a degree of land exchange that would allow
              Northern Ireland cereal farmers to receive a higher level of
              payment for arable aid. Such a scenario would not necessarily take
              away from the aid that is received in the rest of the United
              Kingdom. I ask the Minister to pursue that further.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have not heard much noise from the Department
              on what is being done to improve arable aid payments that are made
              to Northern Ireland farmers. I want more of the modulation money
              to come back to the farming community. I know that that money is
              destined for the rural community, but the money comes out of the
              pockets of the farming community in the first place. I want more
              of that money to go back into the pockets of the farmers for
              environmental schemes, for schemes that improve marketing and for
              schemes that improve animal health beyond the statutory limits
              that are set down by the Department.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the setting up of a group in my
              constituency called Laganside Rural Development Ltd. It will seek
              to acquire funding for items of that nature. I hope that the
              Department of Agriculture and Rural Development will give the
              group its full support. I welcome the support that has been
              received from the Department thus far, and we look forward to the
              support continuing when it comes to the funding of the group.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have always been on at the Minister about the
              beef ban. The Department hopes to have the beef ban lifted this
              year, and it is essential that we get it right and win this time.
              People’s expectations have been raised that the beef ban would
              be lifted, but their hopes have been dashed. No one would have
              thought six or seven years ago that a beef ban would still be in
              place in 2002. That would have been the worst-case scenario that
              could have been painted at the time, yet the beef ban remains in
              place. The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development must
              put all its efforts into seeking the removal of the ban, and
              farmers must fully support the Department in its delivery. It is
              essential that farmers play their part.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Brucellosis is one of the major problems in
              agriculture. It is anticipated that as many as 3,000 cows could be
              lost in a small area close to Lagan Valley. That causes us grave
              concern because some of our top dairy herds are being lost.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We hear much about the benefits of looking
              after the environment. However, these cattle are dying close to
              Lagan Valley Regional Park, and I am genuinely concerned that
              badgers in the park are spreading brucellosis. This costs the
              Exchequer a great deal of money; it causes considerable hardship
              to the people involved and causes the death and destruction of
              many valuable dairy cows. One must consider the benefits of the
              badgers and the benefits of the businesses that are being lost and
              weigh them in the balance. In that case, the balance would be
              heavily on the side of agriculture.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Savage should encourage the Minister of the
              Environment, Mr Nesbitt, to support the agriculture industry. On
              Thursday his officials met the Committee for the Environment to
              discuss farm waste, and the officials gave a poor performance.
              They sought evidence from the farming community to change
              legislation; however, the evidence was not convincing for some of
              the legislation they wanted to introduce. The Department of the
              Environment cannot operate double standards on this issue. If it
              wants to introduce legislation, let it produce convincing evidence
              to support its proposals.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Farmers are concerned about the Minister of the
              Environment’s second announcement on nitrate-vulnerable zones.
              They are concerned that if we go down this route, farmers will be
              crucified. Farmers are often told to do this or do that for the
              environment, and that is fair enough. However, what support do
              they receive to carry this out? It is essential that farmers
              receive the necessary support from the Department of the
              Environment if they are to carry out its requests.</p>

              thank Mr Savage for moving the motion, and I should also like to
              support him in his early retirement scheme. If not that scheme,
              then some form of grant should be introduced to encourage young
              people to take up farming; good, strong education and training
              would also help. Mr Douglas mentioned low-cost loans. I do not
              support these as the farmer is under enough pressure without
              having to pay back loans. However, I fully support the early
              retirement scheme.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the many actions and recommendations
              in the ‘Vision for the Future of the Agri-food Industry’.
              However, there are challenges to be faced in bringing together
              producers, processors and retailers to ensure that all sections of
              the production line receive a fair return for profit. The actions
              and recommendations on strengthening the food chain, protecting
              our animal health status, developing people and safeguarding
              heritage and environment are all worthwhile. The challenge for the
              Department of Agriculture and Rural Development lies in achieving
              the part of the vision report that states:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;It will act as the guardian of our
              land-based heritage and rural environment and will help underpin
              and sustain the social fabric of rural areas.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The number of people involved in farming
              continues to decline. Young people fail to enter the industry, as
              it is regarded as low status, and there are better paid jobs
              available outside farming. The British Government’s policies as
              well as Europe’s red tape are drawing farmers out of the
              industry.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Present policies work against the interests of
              the farmer in the North’s changing economic environment. Factors
              such as the euro/sterling exchange rate, BSE, the common
              agricultural policy (CAP) reform and the World Trade Organisation
              are stated as reasons for decline.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The foot-and-mouth-disease outbreak continues
              to pose a significant threat and has highlighted the vulnerability
              of the industry. That outbreak has served to divert attention from
              the long-term issues that affect the industry. It is vital that
              that focus returns to them as soon as possible.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister should apply her approach and
              should identify the problems and opportunities in the rural
              economy over the next decade. She should develop the ‘Vision for
              the Future of the Agri-food Industry’ to map out a proper
              strategy. There is mistrust and hostility throughout the food
              chain, as producers, processors and retailers do not operate as a
              sympathetic supply chain but work against one another. They are
              working to a narrow agenda, within the constraints of British
              Government policy, following globalisation trends and policies of
              large-scale production at world prices. That policy will not be
              sustainable economically or environmentally in this part of the
              island.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we are to take seriously the problems facing
              the farming industry, and if we are to sustain the viability of
              agriculture, we must work together on an all-Ireland policy,
              producing a quality product, North and South.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must remember that farmers have been the
              backbone of this nation, North and South. It is right that we
              support them by tackling the issues so that we can become a major
              player in the world market, providing a strong, healthy product.

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our farmers are the custodians of the
              countryside; they have looked after and maintained our land for
              hundreds of years. Their work has been taken for granted by those
              who visit the countryside at weekends or during the summer.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After the second world war, we were encouraged
              to supply an excess of products to support other European
              countries that were unable to maintain their own people. Northern
              Ireland now has to compete against these EU countries for markets
              for our products.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under direct rule in Northern Ireland no one
              made specific plans for our health, education or agriculture. It
              is only since the formation of the Assembly and since our present
              Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development took up her post
              that better decisions are being made to improve the situation for
              the Northern Ireland agriculture industry.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our farmers need relevant guidance, and a
              10-year agriculture plan is essential. Farmers have always been at
              the mercy of the buyer to provide products at the lowest cost
              possible. However, they continue to try to realise a moderate
              income for their family. Profits are at an all-time low, and our
              farming families are suffering. Over 60,000 people worked on our
              farms in 1999-2000. That includes 32,000 full-time job
              equivalents, 90% of which are provided by family members. That
              shows how families have been dependent on a decreasing farming
              income.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Farming is no longer an appealing industry in
              which to be involved. There is no encouragement for the younger
              generation. The family farm — a heritage that we are proud of
              — will soon be a thing of the past.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recently farmers have had the highest rate of
              suicide of any occupational group in Britain. Farmers do not
              benefit from a 35-hour week, nor do they get a minimum wage. The
              industry has long been neglected from protective legislation, but
              not by red tape and bureaucracy. Farmers have been exploited for
              the gain of supermarkets and other organisations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many farmers plough through tough times in
              anticipation of a bright future. It is only through the Assembly
              and the commitment of the Executive and the Minister of
              Agriculture and Rural Development that the industry can move
              forward with any optimism. Our agriculture industry requires a
              major regeneration scheme. As Mr Savage mentioned, ways must be
              found to encourage young farmers to remain in the industry, so
              that mature farmers can retire knowing that agriculture will
              survive.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thanks to the work of agricultural colleges,
              young people with enthusiasm and new ideas wait on the sidelines,
              but there is no incentive for them to go into agriculture, because
              of low profit margins and an average wage of around £7,000 a
              year.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Diseases that were unknown here before we
              joined the EEC — not least the latest epidemic of foot-and-mouth
              disease — have endangered the health of our animals. If the
              industry is to survive, more emphasis must be placed on support
              for farmers with regard to environmental issues. Our farmers are
              conscious of the environment, and the Government must ensure a
              reduction in the red tape and bureaucracy and an increase in rural
              development funding for major capital grants schemes to support
              biodiversity and address source pollution. That will help us
              further key environmental objectives.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The development of a sustainable energy system,
              such as biogas and the use of anaerobic digesters, must be
              pursued. The creation of model farms in highly productive areas
              would be one way of achieving that. The Minister of Agriculture
              and Rural Development must work with the Minister of Enterprise,
              Trade and Investment and the Minister of the Environment to
              promote the means of converting waste products into heat and
              power, so that the majority of waste is no longer an unwanted and
              unusable surplus but a valuable component vital to the production
              of energy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I urge the Minister to recognise that farmers
              produce good, wholesome, healthy food and, in doing so, they are
              the custodians of the countryside. With that in mind, she must
              encourage agriculture to make it a profitable and sustainable
              industry, which will attract young professionals.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. I would like to make some
              quick points, because I realise that time is limited.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is time that the Department used its
              imagination to create innovative ideas and examine positive
              methods to help the ailing farming sector. We are familiar with
              the catalogue of ills suffered by the industry in recent years. In
              particular, the problems of the last six years have contributed to
              the hardest times that I can remember. Farmers have had to deal
              with BSE, foot-and-mouth disease, supermarket changes, competition
              and the difference in the exchange rate between the pound and the
              punt, to name but a few of the problems.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those matters have combined to effect a
              downturn in the profitability of every holding in the Province.
              They have resulted in people moving from the countryside into the
              towns. There has been a dramatic change in the countryside. I live
              on a farm on the Ards Peninsula, so I have some idea of what that
              means. For example, there is one remaining pig farm on the Ards
              Peninsula — there used to be about a dozen.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The poultry industry has been decimated. Those
              who were involved in the poultry industry on the Ards Peninsula
              have abandoned it. There have been dramatic changes in every
              sector, such as beef, sheep, cereals, and, as Mr Poots said, dairy
              products.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The industry’s confidence has been knocked,
              and the future looks bleak for many people. The Department must
              take stock of changes in the rural community. At the weekend, I
              read in one of the newspapers that a tourism course for farmers
              has been advertised on the Scottish Agricultural College’s web
              site. The Department must develop imaginative initiatives to
              promote tourism as an alternative to farming. It must provide
              incentives and help with planning regulations and allow
              diversification and the advertising of countryside holidays.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All such initiatives would help. However, only
              so many people can take advantage of such opportunities. EU
              Directives on setting aside land and retaining the countryside
              will encourage them to do so.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly must ensure that finance is
              available for farmers and landowners. Many need to make their
              farms more viable, and one way of doing that is to set land aside.
              It may not be worked, but farmers get an allowance for ensuring
              that that happens. That should be encouraged, through financial or
              other means. Advantages and incentives have been slow to come, and
              that has resulted in land being lost at a crucial time.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another worrying issue is the drifting away
              from farms of the sons and daughters of landowners. I refer to the
              previous point about planning regulations. That cannot be allowed
              to continue. More flexible planning regulations are needed. I am
              aware that that is not the direct responsibility of the Minister
              of Agriculture and Rural Development. However, her Department
              could make some overtures to the Department of the Environment and
              to Dermot Nesbitt.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those who are born on farms and live at home
              with their parents may want to move on when they get married. In
              this difficult economic climate it is important that changes be
              made to enable them to stay on the land. There have been changes
              in the methods of farming. Many people are now part-time farmers
              who supplement their incomes through jobs in towns and elsewhere.
              The regulations must be changed to ensure that sons and daughters
              — those who want to stay on the land — can farm part-time and
              also earn income elsewhere. Flexibility is needed, or the rural
              community will become a desert, a wasteland with few people. That
              must not be allowed to happen.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to make a final point about supermarket
              chains and the prices that are paid to farmers. I was astounded
              when I heard last week that a supermarket chain was claiming that
              it gave fair and equitable prices to farmers for their products.
              That is not what I have been told by farmers who are unhappy with
              the prices being paid, which do not reflect the hours that they
              work or the high-quality goods that they produce.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr William McCrea:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does my hon Friend agree that there needs to be
              a level playing field with the rest of Europe? Northern Ireland’s
              farmers are made to comply with welfare standards and so on that
              are set by Europe, but other European countries do not seem to
              adhere to the same standards. That is a financial burden on our
              farmers.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly wants Northern Ireland’s farmers
              to get fair play, but that is not happening. I thank the Member
              for his comments and ask the Minister to take those points on
              board.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Agriculture and Rural
              Development (Ms Rodgers):</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion calls on me to consider the
              implementation of measures to sustain the viability of the
              agriculture industry in Northern Ireland. Members are aware of the
              many problems that have beset the industry in recent years and the
              impact that those have had on farmers, their families and the
              rural community.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Almost without exception, those problems have
              stemmed from events beyond the influence or control of farmers or,
              indeed, of anyone else in Northern Ireland. That point has been
              recognised in the debate by some Members. Moreover, the problems
              are not unique to Northern Ireland. Given the situation, it is
              clear that a strategic approach is vital to addressing the
              problems and challenges that exist now and that will exist in the
              coming years. It is simply unrealistic to hope that a piecemeal
              approach or one single initiative will solve the problems of the
              industry and underpin its future viability.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with many of the points made by Mr
              Savage and, indeed, have already taken forward initiatives in most
              of the areas that he mentioned. I thank Mr Bradley for his
              recognition of that and assure him that I will continue to advance
              those initiatives. However, I take issue with some of the detailed
              facts and figures quoted by Mr Savage. Nevertheless, I agree with
              him on the need for a 10-year plan with which to chart the way
              forward for the industry.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Indeed, the development of such a plan has been
              a priority of mine since day one. Members will be aware of the
              vision exercise that I initiated immediately after I took office
              in December 1999. The progress of my work was interrupted by a
              two-and-a-half-month suspension and then by the outbreak of
              foot-and-mouth disease last year. Nevertheless, the direct result
              of the exercise was the publication in October 2001 of the vision
              group’s final report, which made over 200 separate
              recommendations covering the actions and responsibilities of both
              the Government and the agriculture industry.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since then, my Department and I have been
              engaged in an extensive consultation process with interested
              stakeholders. In addition, I have held bilateral discussions with
              almost 30 stakeholder organisations. My Department received over
              80 written responses during the consultation process. I would like
              to record my disappointment that Mr Savage’s party, the Ulster
              Unionist Party, did not respond in any way to the recommendations
              contained in the vision group’s report during the consultation
              process. Moreover, it is surprising that Mr Savage made no mention
              of the vision exercise in his opening remarks, yet he spent some
              time dealing with the recommendations of the Curry Report — a
              report which deals specifically with England and not with Northern
              Ireland. The vision group’s report, however, deals exclusively
              with the needs and priorities in Northern Ireland.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Mr Speaker in the Chair)</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the vision consultation process, the
              vision approach was generally accepted, although there were
              several differences of opinion on specific recommendations, some
              of which I will have to attempt to resolve. Taking account of the
              consultation, I am now working on an action plan. The full plan
              will be published in June, but I have decided to accept for
              implementation now several measures that gained broad support in
              the consultation exercise and which can be implemented within
              existing departmental resources.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These measures include setting up focus farms
              to facilitate farmer competence development; information and
              communications technology training and development; and off-farm
              training and reskilling to address underemployment in agriculture,
              which deals with Mr Shannon’s point about the need to skill
              farmers to enable them to take up other employment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, there will be group-based learning
              approaches; a commercial horticulture strategic review; and
              enhanced controls to prevent the introduction of animal diseases.
              An all-Ireland animal and plant health policy will also be taken
              forward. That is already an agreed aspiration for animal health
              under the North/South Ministerial Council, which will consider
              plant health shortly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Enhanced resources will be devoted to the
              detection and prevention of fraud, and there will be an individual
              animal standstill policy, based on 30 days rather than the 21 days
              recommended by the vision group. A working group will be set up to
              assess the need for a food body, as recommended in the report.
              Finally, there will be an independent evaluation of the Erne
              Catchment Nutrient Management Scheme.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Douglas mentioned nitrate-vulnerable zones (NVZs).
              Those are a matter for the Department of the Environment, not for
              my Department. The evaluation will enable us to assess how we can
              bring forward further plans to deal with other areas. Those areas
              will be decided on in the light of advice from the Department of
              the Environment as to where the greatest dangers of pollution are.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Executive Committee Colleagues endorsed
              those proposals at their meeting on 28 February. That is precise
              evidence of the collective approach endorsed by Mr Savage in his
              opening remarks.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By the end of June, I hope to launch the
              complete vision action plan, which will provide a road map for the
              strategic development of the industry over the coming decade. It
              will also form the centrepiece of my Department’s ongoing
              programme to assist and promote the sustainable development of the
              agrifood industry and the rural community that it underpins.
              However, I must emphasise that the vision exercise is a joint
              exercise between the Government and the agriculture industry.
              Almost 40 of the recommendations are for the industry itself to
              implement, and I will be expecting it to respond to them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a significant amount of interest in
              the EU’s early retirement scheme and the new entrants scheme as
              a means of bringing about structural change and introducing new
              blood into the industry. Mr Savage raised that, as did Mr
              Armstrong and several other Members. I have certainly not ruled
              out the possibility of running such schemes in Northern Ireland.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.15 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, questions have been raised about the
              ability of such schemes to deliver tangible and significant
              benefits for the efficient development of the industry. With the
              limited funds at my disposal, I must be satisfied that an early
              retirement scheme or a new entrants scheme would deliver value for
              money and that they would represent a better investment in the
              future of the industry than would alternatives. On that point, Mr
              McHugh and Mr Douglas placed a question mark over the early
              retirement scheme.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An initial review by consultants of the
              operation of the early retirement and new entrants schemes in
              other EU member states was inconclusive with regard to accruing
              structural improvements. For that reason I commissioned research
              into the potential economic, social and environmental benefits
              that might flow from such schemes. The results of that research
              will be available in the summer, and I will then be in a position
              to make an informed decision on the merits of introducing any such
              schemes into Northern Ireland. The Danish scheme to which Mr
              Savage referred is geared to meet Denmark’s specific problem of
              farm succession. My understanding is that successors must purchase
              holdings from their parents or compensate siblings who are
              entitled to equal shares of their parents’ assets. There are no
              such inheritance restrictions in Northern Ireland; the Danish
              scheme is therefore not appropriate to our circumstances.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I noted Mr Kane’s assertion of a defeatist
              attitude. I absolutely refute the suggestion that my Department or
              I might be defeatist in our approach to the problems of the
              agrifood industry. Were that true, I would not have embarked on
              the vision group exercise, which is geared to meeting head-on the
              challenges to which Dr Birnie referred. They are outside our
              control, but must be met proactively, as must the opportunities
              they also represent.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCarthy raised several specific questions
              about the vision group exercise and my response to its
              recommendations. I have already indicated the areas that I intend
              to progress immediately. I still have to consider many more
              recommendations, including budgetary demands. I will be in a
              position to publish my full action plan in June. Meanwhile, I
              thank Mr McCarthy for the initial remarks in his speech.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The vision group exercise is not the only
              initiative that I have advanced to help the agrifood industry. The
              rural development regulation plan represents a substantial
              investment in the future of the agriculture industry in Northern
              Ireland. More than £266 million will be spent between 2000 and
              2006 on sustaining farming in less favoured areas, on supporting
              agrienvironment measures, including organic farming and on
              grant-assisting the afforestation of agricultural land. That
              presents a significant opportunity for farmers and landowners and
              is a further example of my Department’s commitment to
              underpinning the sustainable development of our agriculture
              industry.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to agrienvironment schemes, Mr
              McHugh raised the issue of environmental sustainability. In the
              rural development regulation plan, my Department commits
              considerable resources to such measures as environmentally
              sensitive areas schemes, an organic farming scheme and a
              countryside management scheme. Over the seven years of the rural
              development regulation plan, expenditure on those schemes will
              total some £88 million, which is double the amount spent in the
              preceding seven years.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Douglas raised the issue of E-Plan funding
              for the environmentally sensitive areas scheme. I will keep that
              area under review, and if funding can be secured, I will reopen
              the issue at the earliest opportunity.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Douglas also referred to nitrate-vulnerable
              zones. The Department of the Environment must implement the
              requirements of the EU’s anti-pollution Directives, and that
              implementation is many years overdue. The legislation has already
              been implemented in GB. I appreciate fully the concerns of
              farmers, and particularly their wish to avoid disproportionate
              costs. My officials are in close contact with their counterparts
              in the Department of the Environment to seek proportionate
              implementation in line with good science and objective data. I am
              briefed fully and in discussion with ministerial Colleagues on
              this.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Douglas mentioned agricultural pollution and
              its prevention; DARD is committed to reducing pollution of that
              nature. The Department provides advice and training on good
              farming practice and has secured £6·1&nbsp;million from the
              Executive programme funds for a farm waste- management scheme that
              is currently awaiting EU state aid approval.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Douglas also raised the matter of
              agrimonetary compensation. I have always pressed — with
              considerable success — for the full payment of all available
              agrimonetary compensation. However, the compensation mechanism
              expired at the end of December&nbsp;2001, so there is no
              possibility of further compensation packages being triggered as a
              result of currency movements. There is, however, a possibility
              that residual second and third tranches of previously triggered
              compensation packages may be available in the dairy, beef and
              sheep sectors. We will not know the position on this until the EU
              makes its assessment, which is expected in April.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McHugh and Dr&nbsp;Birnie raised the common
              agricultural policy (CAP). The forthcoming mid-term review of the
              Agenda&nbsp;2000 agreement is yet another of the many challenges
              that the farming community faces and a further source of
              uncertainty. We do not yet know the extent of the changes that the
              EU Commission will propose later this year. The CAP is facing
              significant pressures arising from events such as the enlargement
              of the EU and the World Trade Organisation (WTO) talks, to which
              Dr&nbsp;Birnie referred.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We cannot simply ignore those matters in the
              hope that they will go away. Nor can we ignore the fears, needs
              and aspirations of the agriculture industry and the rural society
              that it underpins. My officials and I are engaged in discussions
              with our counterparts from the other devolved Administrations and
              Whitehall on the UK’s approach to the forthcoming mid-term
              review. Northern Ireland’s interests are being clearly
              articulated, and we are stressing the importance of keeping the
              needs of agricultural and rural communities to the fore.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We cannot prevent change, nor should we want
              to, but we must manage it in such a way that the industry has the
              time and help that it needs to adapt to and exploit the
              opportunities that change inevitably brings. We must avoid
              marginalising and alienating sections of the rural community and
              undermining the stability and viability of the rural economy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;McGrady and Mr&nbsp;Poots mentioned
              brucellosis, and Mr&nbsp;McGrady spoke about tuberculosis (TB). I
              am fully aware that brucellosis and TB continue to be serious
              problems in Northern Ireland. A review of all aspects of the
              control measures for both diseases is currently under way and
              should be completed soon. The review group is considering what
              additional or different measures might be deployed to reduce the
              incidence of those diseases. As Mr&nbsp;McGrady noted, economic
              viability and economic and environmental sustainability demand
              that the industry adapt to reflect the changing demands of the
              market place and the farmers’ increasingly important role as
              custodians of the countryside.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because of the continuous need for change,
              investing in and developing the skills and education of people in
              the industry must be a key part of any strategy for sustainable
              development and viability for the agrifood industry and rural
              economy. Therefore, through the Department of Agriculture and
              Rural Development colleges, I have continued to invest in
              developing education programmes and facilities, with a particular
              emphasis on lifelong learning for those who already work in the
              industry. I noted Mr&nbsp;Armstrong’s comments on biomass, and I
              agree that there is potential for a cross-departmental approach to
              waste.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon spoke about initiatives to promote
              tourism. He will be aware of the natural resource rural tourism
              programme, which is now on-stream, and of the support that is
              available for developing rural tourism. He also raised the issue
              of planning regulations. The vision group’s report recommends
              that planning regulations be examined. That too is a
              cross-departmental issue, as the Department of Agriculture and
              Rural Development does not have sole responsibility for them.
              However, I am very conscious of the matter.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The UK Government are working hard to ensure
              that other EU countries comply with welfare standards, thus
              creating a level playing field.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that I have given some indication of the
              broad range of measures that I am already pursuing to enhance
              further the future viability of Northern Ireland’s agriculture
              industry. It is important that those measures are integrated into
              an overall strategy, and that is what I hope to achieve when I
              launch my full vision action plan in June.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I have already said, there is no point in
              reacting to issues as they arise or in dealing piecemeal with the
              industry — strategic action is required. The vision action plan
              will be a strategy devised to develop the industry over the next
              10 years. It will maintain the viability of rural areas and the
              farming community in a way that meets the challenges and the
              opportunities ahead. Rather than ignore those challenges, we must
              manage and exploit them to our advantage. It is only through
              working together to a common strategic agenda that the industry
              can secure its future survival and prosperity.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Savage:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for giving up her
              afternoon to participate in the debate. As with all agriculture
              debates in the House, there have been many valuable contributions
              from all sides. The Minister has already dealt with many of the
              issues raised, to which I shall add my contribution.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Mr Bradley also said, I emphasise that I in
              no way denigrate the Minister’s efforts. I have the greatest
              respect for her, and I shall support her in any way that I can.
              However, taking action in one area does not meet the need for
              action in other areas. The Minister has done a good job during a
              crisis, and her management and skills, and those of her officials,
              leave us confident in and satisfied with her work.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome Mr Kane’s support. His analysis of
              the powerful world pressures on commodity prices and his call for
              the Department to devise a recovery strategy are issues that we
              must all bear in mind, issues that are near and dear to our
              hearts.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome Mr McHugh’s support for the motion
              and his constructive remarks on the pressures that drive young
              people off the land and on the future of localised markets. I also
              welcome his realistic approach to the failures of the scheme that
              operates in the Republic. We do not want to go down that route,
              although I emphasise that our proposed scheme is very different
              from that in the Republic. Our scheme is modelled closely on those
              employed in other countries that are part and parcel of Europe. We
              are also part of Europe, so we have much in common with those
              other countries.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot accept Mr McCarthy’s comment that
              the motion is premature. The Minister will respond to the vision
              group’s report in her own way. She will respond to that report
              alone, not to the early retirement scheme proposal. I have warned
              of the dangers of adopting a bitty approach to our agriculture
              problems. The Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development
              deals with pressing issues from week to week, and the Assembly
              must take strategic decisions and look at the bigger picture.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome Mr Douglas’s support and his
              remarks on the use of modulation money to advance many of the
              schemes. My Colleague Dr Birnie made useful comments on the
              relative economic importance of agriculture to our economy and on
              the need for common agricultural policy reform. It is especially
              welcome when an Assembly Member who does not represent a rural
              area speaks in an agriculture debate. Farmers sometimes feel that
              our Assembly and Parliaments are cold houses for them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sometimes people do have much time for these
              debates, because they think that farmers are only interested in
              getting their own ends. I assure Members that farmers only want to
              produce the best in whatever sector their outlets might be.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The House needs to get a handle on these issues
              if it is to implement the schemes. As the Minister realises,
              people are coming through our agricultural colleges. There is no
              use educating people if you have no job for them, and the
              Department has to take this seriously. If there is no agriculture
              industry here, there is no call for you people. This is one thing
              that we are serious about.</p>

              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Savage:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the comments of Mr Poots and
              especially his demand for innovative thinking, which is at the
              heart of the matter. I acknowledge Mr M Murphy’s comments of
              support. I welcome the comments of my Colleague, Mr Armstrong, on
              a 10-year agriculture plan for recruiting young people into
              farming by developing alternative income sources and the need for
              the Assembly to take the lead in developing that policy. Mr
              Shannon’s account of the decline in farming from real life
              examples is right, and it is time to take stock. Now is the time
              to act, when we have a period of relative calm without an
              immediate crisis.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although acknowledging all these contributions,
              it is important not to lose sight of the real reason for the
              motion. Many serious points have been raised here today, and I
              know that the Minister is a listening Minister. She takes on board
              what we try to put across, and I am putting things to her as I see
              them. We must take things seriously.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we emerge from this period of recession I
              would like to see a thriving agriculture industry. As the Minister
              said, this can only come about with everybody’s help. Although
              my party may not have responded to one point that she made — and
              we may have overlooked that — I assure her that it is very much
              in the thoughts of all our people.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another important matter that was raised today
              is the health and safety of our industry. If we can keep Northern
              Ireland disease-free, we have a future, and everybody has to play
              a part to ensure that happens. I thank the Minister again for
              giving up her afternoon. We may not see eye to eye on many issues,
              but ultimately we have something in common — we want to see a
              thriving agriculture industry in Northern Ireland. I thank Members
              for their support. I hope that the points raised will bear fruit
              in the days to come.</p>
