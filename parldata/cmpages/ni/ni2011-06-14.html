        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I ask you, in your role as the guardian of the  interested Members of the House, to address your mind to an issue that arises  under Standing Order 20B.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We have a process for the asking of written questions and  for the prioritising for some such questions. Standing Order 20B sets it out in  mandatory terms that a Department shall answer within stipulated periods. I do  not know whether it is just me, but I am certainly having difficulty extracting  answers from one Department in particular: the Office of the First Minister and  deputy First Minister. I have 10 questions that are outside the guideline for  answer. One is a priority written question tabled on 16 May, and here we are a  month later with no answer. That is 21 working days that have passed.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I have a full list if you wish me to supply it to you, but  some action is required to expedite the matter and to cause Departments to live  up to the obligations that are placed on them by Standing Order 20B.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I thank the Member for his very important point of order. I have often said to  all sides of the House that, if Members are having difficulty extracting an  answer, especially an answer to a priority question, from any Minister, I have  always allowed Members to raise that in the House in order to alert the House.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I will write to the Office of the First Minister and deputy  First Minister. I would be happy to have a list of the questions that the  Member is deeply concerned about, and I will take it up with the Office of the  First Minister and deputy First Minister. However, the very fact that the  matter was raised here today has alerted the House.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to advise the House that there will be a  photographer in and around the Gallery today taking photographs of the House.  It is really for the Education Service&rsquo;s new website. It is nothing that  Members on any side should be concerned about.</p>
        <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="a2"></a>Executive Committee Business</p>
        <p class="H4StageHeading">Budget (No. 2) Bill: Second Stage</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I wish to advise Members, as I did yesterday, that the Minister of Finance is  not available and that he is attending the funeral of the former Republic of Ireland Finance Minister, Brian Lenihan.  The House will know that the Bill&rsquo;s Second Stage is to be rescheduled, as was  said yesterday. However, as the item still stands on the Order Paper, it will  need to be dealt with formally this morning.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The following motion stood in the Order Paper:</p>
        <p class="Q3Motion">That the Second Stage of the Budget (No. 2) Bill [NIA  1/11-15] be agreed. &mdash; [Mr Wilson (The Minister of Finance and Personnel).]</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster (The  Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment)</strong>: The motion is not moved.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Motion not moved.</p>
        <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="a3"></a>Committee Business</p>
        <p class="H4StageHeading">Standing Orders</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The next three motions relate to amendments to Standing Orders. I propose to  group all three motions for the purposes of debate. The first motion to be  moved will be motion (c), which proposes the main change to Standing Orders.  Motions (a) and (b) are related to motion (c) but stand alone.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">One amendment to motion (c) has been selected and is  printed on the Marshalled List. A single debate will take place on all three  motions and on the amendment. After the debate, the Question will be put on the  amendment. If the amendment is agreed, motion (c) will fall, as it will have  been overtaken by the amendment. If the amendment is not agreed, I will put the  Question on motion (c). I shall then ask the Chairperson to move formally each  of the two remaining motions in turn, and I will put the Question on each of  them without further debate. Looking at Members from all sides, I believe that  they seem to reasonably understand the way in which we will deal with the  issues. If that is clear, we shall proceed.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey (The  Chairperson of the Committee on Procedures)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
        <p class="Q3Motion">(c) After Standing Order 5 insert</p>
        <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;5A. Principal Deputy Speaker</p>
        <p class="Q3Motion">(1) Any Member of the Assembly may nominate a Deputy Speaker,  who has been elected in accordance with Standing Order 5(1), to act as  Principal Deputy Speaker.</p>
        <p class="Q3Motion">(2) Once a nomination under paragraph (1) has been made, no  further nomination under that paragraph shall be made, unless the person  nominated does not agree to act as Principal Deputy Speaker or the nomination  is not approved, in which case a further nomination may be made.</p>
        <p class="Q3Motion">(3) A nomination to act as Principal Deputy Speaker shall not  take effect unless the person nominated agrees to act as Principal Deputy Speaker  and the nomination is approved by resolution of the Assembly.</p>
        <p class="Q3Motion">(4) Where a nomination has taken effect in accordance with  paragraph (3), the person so preferred may be called &lsquo;Mr Principal Deputy  Speaker&rsquo;, &lsquo;Madam Principal Deputy Speaker&rsquo;, or &lsquo;Principal Deputy Speaker&rsquo;.</p>
        <p class="Q3Motion">(5) If the Assembly resolves that the person acting as  Principal Deputy Speaker should no longer so act, it may, in accordance with  the provisions of this Standing Order, nominate another Deputy Speaker to act  as Principal Deputy Speaker.</p>
        <p class="Q3Motion">(6) Where the Principal Deputy Speaker ceases to hold office  as a Deputy Speaker, any Member of the Assembly may, in accordance with the  provisions of this Standing Order, nominate another Deputy Speaker to act as  Principal Deputy Speaker.</p>
        <p class="Q3Motion">(7) Where a Deputy Speaker is nominated to act as Principal  Deputy Speaker under paragraph (1) or a motion is moved for a resolution under  paragraph (5), a debate relevant to that nomination or resolution may take  place in which no member shall speak more than once.</p>
        <p class="Q3Motion">(8) A resolution under paragraph (3) or (5) shall not be  passed without cross-community support.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The following motions stood in the Order Paper:</p>
        <p class="Q3Motion">(a) In Standing Order 1(3) leave out</p>
        <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;may be called &lsquo;Mr Deputy Speaker&rsquo;, &lsquo;Madam Deputy Speaker&rsquo; or  &lsquo;Deputy Speaker&rsquo; and&rdquo;. &mdash; [Ms S Ramsey (The Chairperson of the Committee on  Procedures).]</p>
        <p class="Q3Motion">(b) After Standing Order 5(3) insert</p>
        <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;(4) A Deputy Speaker may be called &lsquo;Mr Deputy Speaker&rsquo;,  &lsquo;Madam Deputy Speaker&rsquo; or &lsquo;Deputy Speaker&rsquo;.&rdquo; &mdash; [Ms S Ramsey (The Chairperson of  the Committee on Procedures).]</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank you for  your rundown on the procedures for what is going to happen. I speak as the  Chairperson of the Committee on Procedures, and we tabled the motions. The  motions will amend Standing Orders to create the role of Principal Deputy  Speaker, an instruction given to the Committee on Procedures by the Assembly.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Although the original motion on 16 May 2011 was given  cross-community support, I am aware that there is still a great deal of mixed  feeling about it. However, as I open the debate on the Committee&rsquo;s motion, I am  also aware of the significant value that different viewpoints bring to such  proceedings. When matters such as these are brought to the House, they provide  an opportunity to measure just how far the Assembly has come. How do they do  that? They provide an opportunity for the Assembly to demonstrate its  continuing commitment to the democratic process. They provide an opportunity  for robust challenge, which makes sure that quality and accuracy are  maintained, and they ensure that no measure of complacency creeps in, even when  we are dealing with what appear to be the simplest of matters that affect us  all.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We are all aware that not every decision taken in the  Chamber, even when given cross-community support, can meet the expectation of  every Member. That is evidenced by the amendment to Committee motion (c) tabled  by, among others, two members of the Committee on Procedures itself. Although  that could be viewed as a negative, I believe that such work gives us the  opportunity to demonstrate a commitment to putting our point across and  listening to the views of others but then moving forward with the agreement of  the majority. That is a true measure of the commitment of all our Members to  the democratic process. For that reason, I do not support the amendment but  stand over the work agreed by the Committee on Procedures and summarised in the  three motions. It is for that reason that I stand here to speak on the work of  the Committee.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Throughout our deliberations on the issue, varying views  were made clear. Although the Committee was not always in agreement, views were  heard and respected, and the work required by the Assembly was recognised and  achieved. The Committee rose above dissension to take a corporate view of the  work required, and that has resulted in the document before Members.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We are all aware of the background to the motions. On 16  May, the Assembly passed a motion calling for the creation of the role of  Principal Deputy Speaker and instructed the Committee on Procedures to draft  the necessary Standing Order, which was to be tabled by 6 June. That may sound  like a simple instruction; however, the Committee felt that, in order to arrive  at a product that it could stand over, consideration needed to be given to a  broad series of related issues. Issues included what the title of Principal  Deputy Speaker might mean in practice and how practical issues, such as filling  the role, needed to be achieved. The three motions on today&rsquo;s Order Paper  represent the outworkings of those considerations.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee agreed to compile a report on its  deliberations, which has been provided to Members in advance of today&rsquo;s  proceedings. The report was designed to inform Members of the full range of issues  that were considered by the Committee and to assure them of the Committee&rsquo;s  diligence in probing the issues and the reasoning behind the wording of today&rsquo;s  motions. As I said in my opening remarks, there were challenges to the  Committee&rsquo;s decisions. For those who still felt strongly that the role was  unnecessary &mdash; at times, that made for robust discussion around the table &mdash; the  value of challenge cannot be underestimated and was vital in ensuring the  quality of the product.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">How did the Committee approach its task? In the first  instance, it examined legal advice to assure it that the creation of the role  could be achieved without contravening underpinning legislation. Following  receipt of the legal advice, we heard many different points of view &mdash; sometimes  more than once. Ultimately, however, the Committee agreed by a majority of  those present that sufficient latitude existed to proceed and was content,  therefore, to move into the next phase of its deliberations.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee then explored the legislative boundaries  within which discretion existed. For example, we found that the legislation is  clear that the powers delegated by the Speaker are conferred on the Deputy  Speakers. That meant that the role of Principal Deputy Speaker could be carried  out only by a person who had already been elected Deputy Speaker. The Committee  also found that there was no statutory scope to assign extra duties to the  Principal Deputy Speaker and that the role of the Speaker as ex officio  Chairperson of the Assembly Commission and any provision for chairing the  Commission in the Speaker&rsquo;s absence was defined in the 1998 Act. The Act meant  that considering the Principal Deputy Speaker or, indeed, any Deputy Speaker  with regard to that role was outside the scope of the Committee&rsquo;s  deliberations. The Committee also noted that reference to the administration of  oaths and entitlement to vote applied to the Principal Deputy Speaker by virtue  of their already being a Deputy Speaker and, therefore, did not need to be  addressed.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Once boundaries had been identified, the Committee&rsquo;s  deliberations moved onto matters on which various opinions could be considered,  including how a Principal Deputy Speaker would be addressed. The outcome of  that consideration is reflected in proposed new Standing Order 5A(4). The  Committee also considered whether the creation of the role of Principal Deputy  Speaker led to a requirement to appoint additional Deputy Speakers. The  Committee concluded that it did not.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">A key consideration was how the Principal Deputy Speaker  would be selected, and a number of options were examined. The outcome was the  proposal to create new Standing Order 5A, which is before Members in motion  (c). Finally, the Committee examined how the new Standing Orders would sit  alongside existing ones and where explicit references to a Principal Deputy  Speaker would be required.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee report details those deliberations and  subsequent decisions, so I will not labour them now. The outcome of the  deliberations is clear from the wording of the motions. However, by way of  brief explanation, I will say that motions (a) and (b) are paving amendments  for the amendments proposed in motion (c). They do not alter the effect of  Standing Orders at all but, rather, move a provision currently found in Standing  Order 1 to Standing Order 5. The amendment proposed in motion (c) is the  substantive provision; it will create new Standing Order 5A to provide for the  role of Principal Deputy Speaker.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee agreed to include a specific provision in  proposed new Standing Order 5A for a debate to take place in respect of the  appointment or removal of a Principal Deputy Speaker. It was modelled on the  provision for the election of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker in Standing Order  4. To no one&rsquo;s surprise, the Committee unanimously agreed that the role of  Principal Deputy Speaker should attract no specific or extra allowance on top  of those already afforded to the Deputy Speakers. It also agreed by a majority  of those present that rotation of the role among all Deputy Speakers during the  mandate was not desirable. Consideration was also given to the frequency with  which powers are delegated to the Principal Deputy Speaker and whether that  needed to be specific in any way. However, the Committee agreed that that should  stay as it is with any Deputy Speaker at present; that is, it remains a matter  of discretion for the Speaker.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I will draw my remarks to a close, but I am sure that we  will hear from Members who feel strongly that the changes effected by the new  Standing Orders are unnecessary and others who are strongly in favour of them.  However, I hope that, no matter how we feel about the policy behind the motion,  we can accept the direction given by the Assembly, move on to consider the  practical application of the Standing Orders and look forward to and recognise  the part that we have to play in ensuring that the Standing Orders by which the  House is guided are accurate, corporate and enacted according to the motion  passed by the Assembly on 16 May. I hope that we do that in the most efficient  and effective way possible so that we can best serve the interests of the  organisation as a whole.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, on behalf of all Committee members, I take this  opportunity to thank the Committee staff, who worked so hard over the past  three weeks. We were given a short time frame for this. I also thank the people  from Hansard, from the Research and Information Service and, especially, our  legal advisers, who were faced with two great legal minds on the Committee and  who gave us great legal advice. On behalf of the Committee, I thank all our  staff.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I beg to move the following amendment: In Standing Order 5A leave out  paragraphs (1) to (8) and insert</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The position of Principal Deputy Speaker shall be  filled by annual rotation between the Deputy Speakers who have been elected in  accordance with Standing Order 5(1). The order of such rotation to be as agreed  between the Deputy Speakers, or in the absence of agreement as directed by the  Speaker. Throughout the term the Principal Deputy Speaker may be called &lsquo;Mr  Principal Deputy Speaker&rsquo;, &lsquo;Madam Principal Deputy Speaker&rsquo; or &lsquo;Principal  Deputy Speaker&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Speaker, is the debate time-limited?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  No, it is not time-limited.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Before I deal in substance with the amendment, I want to make it very plain  from the outset that, in the SDLP&rsquo;s view, there is no need for the change in  title from Deputy Speaker to Principal Deputy Speaker. That view is supported  by Mr McClarty, who was a distinguished Deputy Speaker in the previous mandate.  On page 38 of the Committee&rsquo;s report, Members will see his written submission.  He said:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I wish to strongly object to the creation of the post  of Principal Deputy Speaker. I believe that this is completely unnecessary given  the experience of the position of deputy speakers in the Assembly over the  years. I am speaking from my own personal experience of serving as a deputy  speaker for a four year term. The system which is presently employed works  exceedingly well and does not require tinkering with.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is the substance of what he said.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I do not understand why we are being troubled with changes  to Standing Orders. At first, it was envisaged that the position of Principal  Deputy Speaker would involve not only a change in title but a change in  function. That was ruled out following legal advice to the Committee. It was  clear from the legal advice that, under the Northern Ireland Act 1998, a change  in function could not take place and, therefore, there would be a change in title  alone. However, although, at this moment in time, there will be no change in  function for the Principal Deputy Speaker, I anticipate that, over the next  three years, there will, in fact, be an attempt to change the statute relating  to Deputy Speakers in order to add functions to the position of Principal  Deputy Speaker. In other words, there will be some sort of retrofitting to the  new title.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The new title is proposed to assuage the political ego of  Sinn F&eacute;in. It feels that it ought to elevate its Deputy Speaker to such a  position of prominence. In essence, it creates &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Let me just finish this point. It creates a hierarchy among the Deputy  Speakers. That is contrary to the spirit of this institution, which was founded  &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke (The  Deputy Chairperson of the Committee on Procedures)</strong>: On a point of order, Mr  Speaker. Surely, today&rsquo;s motion is about the procedures and not about whether  we have a Principal Deputy Speaker. I thought that that debate had already  taken place. Today&rsquo;s debate is about proposed changes to the process, something  that was originally taken to Committee but was not agreed. Now we are getting  into a debate that we had in the House about the very role of a Principal  Deputy Speaker and the rights and wrongs in Mr Maginness&rsquo;s eyes. Surely that  debate has taken place and, today, we should be discussing the process and how  we change the Standing Orders to fit that.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I listened to the point of order that has been raised. Today&rsquo;s debate is on the  procedures and changes to Standing Orders. In all those issues, I always allow  Members a wee bit of latitude in and around the issue. That is important in how  they might develop their argument. I remind all sides of the House that today,  as far as possible, we are debating changes to Standing Orders.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Of course, Mr Speaker, I accept that. However, underlying the issue is a  crucial point, which is that the House was founded on partnership and on the  basis of equality and sharing power. If a hierarchy is created, as, in fact, it  would be here, it would be contrary to the spirit and the principles on which  the House was founded. The change comes from an arrangement between two  political parties, not among all the political parties in the House. Therefore,  it tampers with and undermines &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I urge the Member to come back to the issue that is before us.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I am laying the ground for coming back to it. Bear with me, Mr Speaker, on this  point. It is a bilateral arrangement between two political parties in the House  to change Standing Orders and change the title of one of the Deputy Speakers to  Principal Deputy Speaker. It has to be said that that is injurious to the  integrity of the House. It is important for all of us to beware of tampering,  once again, with the integrity of the House and the arrangements set up under  the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, the power to change the functions clearly does  not exist presently in the House. That may well change in future, but I hope  that it does not. If the House insists on changing the title and insists on  creating the new title of Principal Deputy Speaker &mdash; I said from the outset  that we do not accept that &mdash; the amendment that has been tabled by my party,  supported by the Ulster Unionists and Mr Allister, proposes that the  appointment of the Principal Deputy Speaker should take place annually and  should be done on the basis of rotation. If we are to change, that seems to be  a better way of doing so. It is on the basis of equality and partnership, and  it deals with the basic justice of the situation to bring about an equitable  distribution of the position of Principal Deputy Speaker.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I will give way to Mr Campbell and then to your good self.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. Earlier, he talked about the ego of Sinn  F&eacute;in. Deputy Speakers from his party have attended royal events. Does he agree  that, if Sinn F&eacute;in were prepared to use the position of Principal Deputy  Speaker to meet royalty, that would be a small price to pay?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I do not quite get your point. I hope that every Member in a position of  responsibility would meet any distinguished guest who came to the House. My  party and I have no problem with that. On occasion, Members from my party have  met royalty. I reflect on Her Majesty&rsquo;s visit to the Irish  Republic, which did a lot of good for  all of the people who live on this island and for relations between Ireland and Britain.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Your colleague was first.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>: I  appreciate the Member&rsquo;s giving way. I want to tease out the thought process  behind the amendment. You touched on equality and power sharing. Are you saying  that, under the proposal for annual rotation, you support Sinn F&eacute;in holding the  post of Principal Deputy Speaker at some stage? That lies at the core of the  amendment.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I have no problem with any party holding the position of Principal Deputy  Speaker, if we have to have that position, but I do not think that we need it.  Nonetheless, if the House insists on creating that position, every party that  has a Deputy Speaker should be entitled to the position, including Sinn F&eacute;in.  We have never objected to Sinn F&eacute;in occupying that position, and why should we?  Everyone in the House has a mandate from the people, and, whether the  arithmetic of your representation is weak or strong, you have certain rights.  Therefore, you should have the right to hold that office.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. You used the example of the Royal Family  visiting the Irish   Republic. It was  noticeable that, yesterday, when the motion before the House was to send a  message of congratulations to a member of the Royal Family, the SDLP had  nothing to say on the matter. Sinn F&eacute;in had nothing to say on the matter, and,  as a matter of fact, Mr McGuinness made a point of absenting himself during the  debate, followed closely by Mr Pat Doherty, who obviously did not want anything  to do with that message of congratulations. I suspect that the actions of the  SDLP yesterday, to some degree, embarrassed Mr Maginness, because it was  written all over his face. I want the Member to respond to that point as  explicitly as he can. I suspect that, had it been left to his discretion, he  might have said something. Obviously, the orders come from above: keep your  heads down, boys.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Before Mr Maginness continues, I remind the whole House that the motion is  about changes to Standing Orders &mdash; nothing more, nothing less. I am more than  slightly worried that the discussion is widening and almost becoming a  different debate.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">So, once again, let us try to keep to the motion that is on  the Floor.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">11.00 am</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I will, Mr Speaker, try to obey your instructions on the matter. However, I  cannot read the mind of the deputy First Minister on that matter yesterday.  However, there was no objection by the SDLP or, indeed, Sinn F&eacute;in to the  congratulations to the Duke of Edinburgh.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I think that the amendment is fair, has been reasoned and  is reasonable, and it reflects what I hope to be the commitment of this House  to partnership and equity right across the whole institution. Therefore, I  commend the amendment to the House.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I remind the whole House again that there is no time limit on the debate.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  I support the amendment that the Ulster Unionists have tabled. However, as we  discuss this enabling legislation today, I want to make a few points about the  proposal as it stands and the appointment. First, because you can do something  does not mean that you should do it. I do not believe that a case has been made  for this proposed appointment on the grounds of need. It needs to be spelt out  where exactly we fell short in the last mandate to make this appointment  necessary. How did that supposed shortfall show up? What shortcomings drove and  led to the proposal?</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We need to list the legislatures across the world that have  a role similar to that of the proposed Principal Deputy Speaker. Is it  appropriate to compare the devolved Northern Ireland Assembly, which has only  108 Members, with the House of Commons, which has 650 Members but has only  three Deputy Speakers, which is the same number as in this Assembly? I have to  ask another important question: how many sittings does the House of Commons  have &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. There must be something in the water of those  who have tabled the amendment, because we are back to debating whether the  position of Principal Deputy Speaker should be created. While I am on my feet,  I suggest that, if the Ulster Unionists had attended the meetings, they could  maybe have put their case forward there. However, we are getting off the  essence of the debate.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. I have said on two occasions in the House that there are no time limits.  So, any Member who wants to speak in this debate today will certainly have time  to speak. So, let us be careful. Once again, I remind the whole House: let us  try to get back to the debate, which is about the changes to Standing Orders. I  am prepared to allow Members some latitude to develop their argument, but I  then like Members, as far as possible, to come back to the motion, which, once  again, is about the changes to Standing Orders.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  I have to ask another important question: how many sittings does the House of  Commons have and how long are they? How many hours a week do the Speaker and  Deputy Speakers serve compared to those in the Northern Ireland Assembly? Why  on earth do we need all these Deputy Speakers, with one being named as  Principal Deputy Speaker, when Scotland  has only two Deputy Speakers and the D&aacute;il in Dublin has only one Deputy Speaker? Given  that the post attracts additional pay, what sort of message does that send out  to the electorate at the same time as public spending cuts &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  No. We are supposed to support the interests &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. Allow the Member to continue.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  Does that message not run counter to everything that we have been saying about  saving money, cutting the number of Assembly Members, freezing Civil Service  pay and cutting the number of Departments?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. I am trying to guide the Member as far as possible. I am listening to  the Member, and I believe that he is speaking to the amendment. If the Member  were to link his remarks to the amendment as far as possible, it might help him  to speak to it.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  I will be brief.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  No. The Assembly does not need a Principal Deputy Speaker. Therefore, I will be  brief; I support the amendment.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lyttle</strong>:  Thank you for the opportunity to speak on the issue. I imagine that members of  the public following the debate may wonder why the Assembly is not discussing  more important matters. Having reflected on the proposals, I must say that I  see no compelling identification of a problem or, indeed, a solution to the  problem in the amendment or motions; nor is any value added to the vital office  of Speaker of the House. That is why I see no good reason to support the  amendment or motions. I call on Members to keep the office of Speaker beyond  such political debate in order that it may continue to command the full  confidence of the House, as is necessary for the delivery of its business.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McMullan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. The argument that the SDLP and the  Ulster Unionists put up against the motions is really an attack on my party.  The argument was put to them clearly. The legal argument was put to them  clearly. This morning, Members have totally wandered off the point and away  from the arguments that we are here to debate. I cannot understand why time is  being wasted. We have gone through and discussed the arguments in meetings. We  have heard all of the legal advice, and everything has been put in front of us.  Yet we still argue points that have been agreed. Decisions were taken in  Committee. I thought that the relevant parties had agreed those positions.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I appreciate Mr McMullan&rsquo;s giving way. It is critical that the issue is  debated. It will impact the culture of the House and, as Mr Lyttle said, the  office of Speaker. Perhaps Mr McMullan could address what concerns me most,  which is to redefine equality in the House. That is what we seek to do through  the amendment. Equality has gone from being a situation in which we all come  here and share the burden of responsibility equally to Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP&rsquo;s  being more equal than others. That is a hierarchy of equality and, therefore, a  new inequality in the House. I do not see how it is in the interests of the  House or any party, particularly one that has campaigned so vehemently on the  basic principle of equality, to introduce such a code to the House. That is the  serious impact of those changes, and they send a negative signal to the outside  world.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McMullan</strong>:  We have all fought against equality for years. I do not think that now is the  time to lecture on equality, or inequality &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. Allow the Member to continue.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McMullan</strong>:  Why does the SDLP go against legal advice and argue that there is a hierarchy?  All of the legal advice was explained to you in Committee. Indeed, Committee  members from the legal profession could not disagree with it.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I have been invited to make an intervention, and I will do so. The legal advice  is clear that the function of Deputy Speaker cannot be changed because it is  set out in the Northern Ireland Act 1998. The title can be changed, but there  ends the legal advice, and the rest becomes a matter of political judgement. My  party&rsquo;s political judgement is that it is wrong to create a hierarchy because  it creates inequality. I thought that Sinn F&eacute;in was the party of equality and  aspired to an Ireland  of equals. You have got an Ireland  of equals, except in the House, because you have got a Principal Deputy Speaker  over and above the other two parties, namely the Ulster Unionists and the SDLP.  That is stark inequality.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>:  Like other Members, I will be brief in dealing with this motion and the  amendment, because there is very little to discuss. The Assembly has decided to  create the position of Principal Deputy Speaker, and, today, we are talking  about the process and how that appointment will operate. The role has been  created; that decision has been taken. I realise that some Members do not like  that decision, but the democratic institution has taken that decision, and  those who respect democracy will respect the will of the House.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Agnew</strong>: I  appreciate that we have already debated the motion, but, as I said during the  first debate, we have yet to be told why the change is necessary. Out of  respect for democracy, the House and the voting public, will the Member please  take the opportunity to explain why the change is necessary? We have yet to  hear that argument.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>:  The will of the House has deemed that it is necessary. A minority in the House  do not want the position, but a majority of the House do. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Member must be heard.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>: If  it is good enough for Westminster,  it is good enough for the Assembly. I have no difficulty with this distinction  being made among the Deputy Speakers in other legislatures. It happens in Westminster. The Canadian  Parliament is another example of a legislature where that is the case, so I am  happy to follow the examples of other Commonwealth nations.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  The appointment of Deputy Speakers is governed by the Deputy Speaker Act 1855.  It required specific legislation. We are not talking about legislation here; we  are talking about a change in Standing Orders, which affects the political  atmosphere of the House. It poisons it through the creation of a hierarchy  within the House.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>:  The Member is unhappy that we are somehow undermining what was envisaged in the  1998 Belfast Agreement; the power-sharing arrangement in which everyone in the  House was going to be equal. I am quite happy to undermine the spirit of that  agreement. It does not present a particular difficulty for me, but I recognise  that it does for the SDLP and the Ulster Unionists.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">What does intrigue me is that Jim Allister has appended his  name to the amendment. I will quote some comments of the SDLP&rsquo;s Alban  Maginness. He said that this place was founded on equality and power sharing.  He mentioned the undermining of the Good Friday Agreement and the spirit of  that agreement. He also said that this debate was about the basis of equality  and partnership. I put it to the Member that the amendment states that the  position of Principal Deputy Speaker will be filled by annual rotation of  Deputy Speakers. The Deputy Speakers include a Sinn F&eacute;in Member and, according  to that amendment, Sinn F&eacute;in will hold the position of Principal Deputy Speaker.  The proposer of the amendment agreed with that; he agreed that Sinn F&eacute;in would  hold the position. That is why I am intrigued. We have interesting bedfellows  here. The SDLP and the Ulster Unionists are arguing about one year or two  years, or whatever it may be, but, fundamentally, they are content for Sinn  F&eacute;in to hold the position. Jim Allister has signed his name to that. Therefore,  let us be clear for the public, if they do tune in to this: Jim Allister has no  difficulty in Sinn F&eacute;in holding the position of Deputy Speaker. Whether it is  for one year or two years is splitting hairs.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  The honourable Member has a short memory. It includes the abandonment by him  and his party of every election pledge they ever made on these issues. Without  stretching his memory too far, may I take him back to 16 May when he may recall  that one person in the House sought to avoid the appointment of a Sinn F&eacute;in  Deputy Speaker. That was me and me alone. He and his colleagues voted a Sinn  F&eacute;in Deputy Speaker through. So, I take no lessons from the Member or his party  on those issues.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>:  What we have is a flip-flop, another somersault, from the Member. Three weeks  ago, he made a virtue of saying: &ldquo;I opposed Sinn F&eacute;in; I fought the good  fight&rdquo;. However, now he puts his name to an amendment that is saying: &ldquo;I have  no problem with Sinn F&eacute;in holding this position for one year&rdquo;. That makes an  absolute nonsense and hypocrisy of the so-called principled position that the  Member says he has. We are not going to take lectures from Jim Allister on that  issue today, because he is accepting the principle of Sinn F&eacute;in holding the  position of Principal Deputy Speaker by putting his name to the amendment. The  public will realise that he is trying to con them with this so-called  principled position. The electorate realised that when he put himself forward  and was rejected at the polls again. He is only here, having been elected  beneath the quota and on the back of DUP transfers. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. I really must insist that the Member gets back to the motion and to the  business on the Floor. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>: Mr  Speaker, it is difficult for me to comment on the contribution made by the  Ulster Unionist Member for Upper Bann. I am  surprised that he said that there are only 108 MLAs in the Assembly and that  the Assembly should not be compared to Westminster.  I am content that this place should be compared to Westminster. As a unionist, I consider it to  be the Mother of Parliaments, so I am quite happy for the Assembly to be  compared with it.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Member also said that there was concern about  allowances. Under the proposal, no allowance would be added to the position of  Principal Deputy Speaker.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  I appreciate that the Member is not on the Committee but does he accept that  had the Member from the Ulster Unionist Party Mr Gardiner attended all four  meetings &mdash; he did manage to get to one, but there were only four of them &mdash; he  perhaps would have learnt that the Committee recommended that there be no financial  remuneration made to that post.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>: I  thank the Member, who attended all of those Committee meetings, for making that  point.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. A claim has been made that I attended only one  meeting. I attended, I think, more than one meeting. I was not there on another  occasion because a deputation was seeing one of the Ministers, and his meeting  ran on, so I sent one of my staff down to apologise.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Member has made his point. I assure him that, as Speaker, I do not  get involved in the business of Committees.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Speaker. He also made a point about whether we need so many  Deputy Speakers. If the Ulster Unionist Party is volunteering to give up that  post, that is a matter for it to decide. I am sure that the Member for East Antrim who is a Deputy Speaker will be intrigued to  know that his party feels that he is not actually needed.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I thank Mr Givan for giving way. I am curious about two things that we have  established during the debate this morning. The first is that the DUP believes  that the creation of a hierarchy among Deputy Speakers is, in fact, properly  unequal and, in their words, democratic. The second is that Sinn F&eacute;in believes  that the creation of a hierarchy among the Deputy Speakers is, in fact, the  embodiment of equality. Apart from what that augurs for the future of the  Executive and the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister, I  would like to ask Mr Givan, specifically on the motion, about whether he is  quite content that there is a hierarchy. The point has been made that there  will be inequality, because that is the outworking of the democratic will of  the House, so what is the problem with the position being rotated?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>: I  think that the problem is that the House wants the position of a Principal  Deputy Speaker. The point I have made is that a minority of parties that do not  like the will of the people on the outside, even though they voted them into  this position, are unhappy. The public will see that we are really splitting  hairs over this issue. All 108 Members in the House clearly have no difficulty  with whomever takes up the position &mdash; Jim Allister has signed up to that  principle today and has no difficulty with Sinn F&eacute;in holding on to the  position. So, we really are splitting hairs.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I appeal to the Ulster Unionists and the SDLP not to  portray the image that they are so unhappy with the outcome of the elections,  which is what I think the public will see in the pedantic way in which the  parties are approaching this issue.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  I am not a member of the Committee and am very pleased to be speaking on this  today. This is not a trivial matter. This is something that I am quite  passionate about. This is a matter of key importance. We may have lost the  earlier debate; therefore, we are today proposing an amendment that would see  the job of Principal Deputy Speaker rotated. That is the least worst of the  options. Today we are seeing something that seems small but that actually is  very important; the creation of another two-party deal or job-share. Looking at  this carefully, along with many other matters, I see this as another nail in  the coffin of Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s democracy.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, we have already voted on this. However, today,  we have a sensible motion to rotate the new role of Principal Deputy Speaker.  It is essential to point out the context that this comes into. We have already  heard from one Member that he is happy to undermine the roles here. We are also  aware that we are not meant to discuss things from the public&rsquo;s point of view,  especially if we have lost an election. We are to be pushed into a corner and  told to sit down. This is a nail in the coffin, and there have been many. For  example, the St Andrews deal links one First  Minister always to the biggest party. That is undemocratic. That links to  today&rsquo;s change. We also have the fact that any Minister, such as the Education  Minister, can ignore what is going on &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Kelly</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Do you accept that, again, we are going back  into history and not dealing with the issue at stake? Now we are talking about  the St Andrews Agreement; we will probably be talking about the Good Friday  Agreement before that. Can we get back to the point?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member makes a very good point of order. We have talked about almost  everything else this morning except what we should be talking about. Members  from all sides of the House will know that I do like to give Members some  latitude in developing their arguments, but please try to link those arguments  to the motion that is on the Floor. I take it that the Member is speaking to  the amendment. It is important that all Members, whether speaking to the motion  or the amendment, try to link the amendment or the motion to what they are  saying.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  Mr Speaker, thank you. There is a need today for latitude because this new role  and its rotation links into everything that we do and how this House works. If  you would all let me carry on, you would see how what I am saying links to our  amendment.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I go back to my point that this is a nail in the coffin of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  democracy. The creation of one person in a better position than the other three  stops the fairness that should be in this House. We have had plenty of examples  of that before, such as the use of the petition of concern over the review of  public administration (RPA) and double-jobbing or dual mandates. However, we  are meant to be modelling this House on Westminster.  Most of the world looks on Westminster  as one of the best Parliaments. Therefore, I want to see Stormont as one of the  best Parliaments and best democracies in the world.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Speaker is meant to be non-partisan. In Westminster, he leaves  his party. He is meant to be independent at all times. In Westminster, he is there for life, until he  stands down or, as we saw once, has to stand down due to a misdemeanour. We  have a good example of that here. To split the post in two and have a  vice-principal Speaker nails both jobs to a party. That removes the  independence. That is why we want to see the role rotated.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We have already heard that this is introducing a hierarchy.  We already know that, in Westminster,  there is one Speaker &mdash; no principal Speaker &mdash; for 650 Members. We lost that  debate. We have four Deputy Speakers, and they should be rotated. That is the  least worst option, but we have to put up with it.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I want to know why. Is this another deal that is being put  on us today, in which we have to change Standing Orders? It is another DUP/Sinn  F&eacute;in appointment. What has happened to independence? What has happened to being  non-partisan? It is right that we look at this from the point of view of it  being a nail in the coffin of democracy.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Last week, Cameron came here and told us that we should  have an opposition; that is, we should be more democratic. Yet, today, there is  opposition to the idea of trying to have four Speakers rotating, and, again,  the two parties are pushing forward to stop us from having a form of democracy.  I think you have the gist of it. It is a grave error. The amendment makes it  slightly better, so I will stick with it.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Kelly</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Up until now, we have been dealing  with a mishmash of a debate. I have noticed that a lot of Members from other parties  have stood up and that most of their speeches have not been to do with the  amendment. A lot of them have been led astray, but I will try not to be led  astray. I am speaking in favour of the motion and against the amendment  proposed by Jim Allister, Alban Maginness and Tom Elliott.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As was said before, the Assembly tasked the Committee with  bringing forward the necessary amendments for a Principal Deputy Speaker, which  was agreed on 16 May, and there was cross-community support for it. Indeed, the  Committee had a similar debate to the one that we are having today. It was very  hard, in Committee, to pin down the issue that the Committee was supposed to  deal with, yet we got all sorts of legal advice, including from the two great  lawyers &mdash; as Sue Ramsey described them &mdash; Jim Allister and Alban Maginness. I  might take her to task on that. However, in the end, they fought their case,  they argued their point, they lost it to the Committee, and the Committee is  now bringing the issue forward. We also discussed legislative boundaries, and  Alban Maginness is right: to go any further than we are going today may mean  that we have to have legislation. If we have to do that, let us deal with it  when the time comes.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I want to deal with a couple of other things. Sam Gardiner  said that there was some sort of extra remuneration or allowance: there is  none. That was the only thing on which the Committee was unanimous. There were  a number of other issues around frequency and how a Principal Deputy Speaker  would be used. Of course, that was put down to the discretion of the Speaker.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP, in particular, made a huge play on the issue of  equality and tried to redefine equality, hierarchy and democracy. The  difficulty is that we have different sizes of parties, we have different votes,  we have an Executive that have different numbers of Ministers representing the  parties, and we have votes in the Assembly that are determined on the strength  of the parties, even in cross-community votes. Therefore, in essence, the SDLP  is whingeing about the fact that it did not do well in the past three  elections. The party is mixing up equality with democracy. I think that Danny  Kinahan said that it was a nail in the coffin &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Kelly</strong>:  Give me a moment. I was going to ask you whether you are a lawyer because I  have a notion that if I give way to lawyers, they will speak for 20 minutes.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  No, I am not a lawyer.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Kelly</strong>:  You speak like one. The SDLP&rsquo;s argument is against democracy. A vote was taken  to bring the issue forward. The Committee did exactly what it was told to do  and put it to a vote. That was democracy. The issue was then brought forward,  and those who did not win the vote in the Assembly or in Committee are now  arguing that we are doing down democracy, but that is absolutely untrue.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I assure the House that I have no formal legal training whatsoever and he can  take up any slur that I might speak like a lawyer with his friends who are  lawyers. However, on the substantial point, there is a basic issue of equality  here. Mr Kelly&rsquo;s party and my party argue that the Office of the First Minister  and deputy First Minister are co-equal.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, they should be called and designated &ldquo;joint  First Ministers&rdquo;. We argue that because we do not believe that you should use a  title to differentiate between people. The motions are an attempt to use a  title to differentiate between people. In other words, we have an attempt to do  with the Deputy Speakers exactly what Sinn F&eacute;in is against doing with the  Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister: create a hierarchy of  titles among a bunch of people who have the same job to do. On that basic  point, this is inequality; it is the absolute outworkings of inequality. I just  hope that Mr Kelly and Sinn F&eacute;in might reflect on that fact and, before it is  too late, take their position away and come back to it another day.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Kelly</strong>:  His is a simplistic but very false argument in trying to redefine &ldquo;hierarchy&rdquo;.  It could be argued, with respect to you, Mr Speaker, that we have a hierarchal  system because you are in charge of the Deputy Speakers. That argument misuses  all of those factors. We have the argument that this system is never used  anywhere else, yet there are people who will defend the systems in Westminster  and Canada, where they have something similar if not an exact replica of this.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">On the subject of the Speaker, Principal Deputy Speaker or  Deputy Speaker, let me say to Danny Kinahan that all Members who take up those  posts come from political parties. We know that. Whether they are Deputy  Speaker, Principal Deputy Speaker or Speaker, their duty is to be non-partisan,  and that is accepted no matter what their position.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP always talks a lot about intent. The First Minister  and deputy First Minister issue is a point that Conall McDevitt got wrong as  well. In fact, if I remember correctly, it was the SDLP that argued and fought  for the terms &ldquo;First Minister&rdquo; and &ldquo;deputy First Minister&rdquo;. The SDLP made that  mistake, so let it not try to rewrite history. On intent, which was mentioned  on a number of occasions, Sinn F&eacute;in, by leave of the Assembly, will of course  go for the position of Speaker. That was announced by the First Minister and  deputy First Minister in the previous debate on this issue. This is about  partnership. It is about good government and moving forward, so I support the  motion.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Agnew</strong>:  This is a clear case of how the Assembly is failing to move forward towards a  genuinely shared future, as opposed to a future that is shared out. The  original setting up of the positions of Deputy Speakers was an example of  sharing out. This, again, is a step towards sharing out. If we genuinely want  to keep Northern Ireland moving forward, as many claimed during the election,  the Assembly needs to lead the way in moving forward and not seek to further  duplicate positions in the way that we duplicate services in our society.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The only arguments given by those who put forward the  proposed change are, first, &ldquo;We are going to do it because we can&rdquo;, and,  secondly, &ldquo;Well, others have done it, so why should we not?&rdquo; I do not see those  as strong arguments and I do not accept them. What has not been demonstrated is  that there is a need for this change. These institutions were created with the  endorsement of the people of Northern    Ireland in what was the people&rsquo;s agreement.  I refer to comments made by a Member who said that he was happy to undermine  the Good Friday Agreement. Well, I am not, because it was endorsed by the  people of Northern Ireland,  and any changes that we make to it should not be taken lightly. No party put in  their manifesto that they wanted to make this change. It has not been endorsed  by the people of Northern    Ireland, and I believe that no party is  mandated to make such a change.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I have said before in the House that I perceive the role of  Principal Deputy Speaker to be a mere token, and I maintain that position. I  said that I would be open to being convinced otherwise, but I have not been  convinced. It is for that reason that I reject the motion and the amendment. I  cannot give my support or endorsement to the position of Principal Deputy  Speaker because I think its creation is disrespectful to the House, these  institutions and the people of Northern    Ireland, who endorsed these institutions and  have not asked for this change.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  We have now debated this issue twice and had four sessions on it in the  Procedures Committee, and we arrive at the end of this process with not one  individual in the House or the Committee able to articulate a reason why we  need a Principal Deputy Speaker. The challenge was laid down at every meeting  of the Committee. Someone who is anxious today to raise points of order to shut  down debate had the opportunity &mdash; namely, Mr Clarke &mdash; but was never once able  to articulate to the Committee why we need a Principal Deputy Speaker.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  For slow learners, let me say that the amendment is clear. The Committee was  charged to look at the process of changing Standing Orders. The Committee was  not charged to give reasons behind the change of function. It was charged to  change Standing Orders to reflect the decision taken by the Assembly. If Mr  Allister does not understand that, we can perhaps get it in larger print for  him.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  If the Member&rsquo;s approach to politics is that you do something because someone  else tells you to do it, you have no idea why, and you cannot think for  yourself what the &ldquo;why&rdquo; might be, you just do it, then he is the classic  example of Lobby fodder. He comes to this House without an idea in his head  about why he is going to vote for a Principal Deputy Speaker and is incapable  of articulating a reason as to why we need one. The Member condemns himself out  of his own mouth in the manner in which he deals with this issue.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">No need for the post has been established; we have no  function for it; and we have no argument made for it. It is little wonder that  there is such embarrassment in the House during this debate on the two main  Benches. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  No Member who occupies those Benches has the capacity to tell us why we need a  Principal Deputy Speaker. There is nothing there to give. That is why those  Members want this debate over and swept under the carpet. This is not an  appointment by reason or dint of need, or by dint of anything proved to be  absent or deficient hitherto. It is an appointment by dint of a sordid deal  between the two main parties, whereby, in order to keep the seat of the present  Speaker warm for another three years for Sinn F&eacute;in, a deal is done that a Sinn  F&eacute;in Principal Deputy Speaker will be appointed.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Let me come to the distracting hypocrisy of the suggestion  that someone is supporting something against his principles. I know that it  might be difficult for some to comprehend nuance. Let me give an example. The  party that sits to my left purportedly takes a stand on abortion &mdash; a proper  stand of opposition to it. When abortion was debated in the House of Commons,  what did that party do? It tried to make the best of a bad job by voting to  reduce the limit from 24 weeks to 20 or 18 weeks.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. As I have said to all Members, they should, as far as possible, stick to  the subject of the debate, the motion that is before the House. I am prepared  to give Members some latitude in and around that. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Members should not try to shout across the Chamber. They  should not do that. They should desist from doing that.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  I thought, and I hoped that you would see, that I make a legitimate debating  comparison. When debating something that, on principle, you do not want at all,  just as the DUP in the House of Commons tried to diminish the impact of  abortion by voting to make the best of a bad job, in this House, I am faced  with the steamroller, the juggernaut of the irrational, the inability to  articulate the &ldquo;why&rdquo;, from the two parties by virtue of the political cabal and  deal they have reached, and it behoves those in the House who want to think  about issues to try to make the best of a bad job.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">However, in this case, the DUP position seems to be that it  wants a Sinn F&eacute;in Principal Deputy Speaker for three years, and it rejects the  possibility of diminishing that to one year because it is so tied in,  inextricably and inexplicably, to the party that sits to my right.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>:  Perhaps the Member could clarify: if he takes such a 100% principled position  on the issue with regard to Sinn F&eacute;in, surely it should not even be one year  for the Member, it should be never? He has signed up to say that Sinn F&eacute;in should  have it for one year.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  If the Member is willing to join me, as he was not three or four weeks ago, in  making sure that it is never, he will not be without company in that, I assure  him. However, the honourable Member&rsquo;s embarrassment comes from the fact that it  appears that his members on Committee could not make up their minds on rotation  because they had not received their riding instructions, and they abstained in  the vote in the Committee. Presumably they have received their riding instructions  by now and have been pulled into line to vote with Sinn F&eacute;in against rotation,  to give the post to Sinn F&eacute;in for three years and vote down any proposition  that would diminish the level of Sinn F&eacute;in occupancy of the post. That is the  real position that the honourable Member wishes to cover. That is why he seeks  to be so voluble in trying to distract attention from his position.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">What of Sinn F&eacute;in? I thought that Sinn F&eacute;in was a party  that pontificated about a classless society. Well, maybe old habits die hard.  Maybe it likes titles like &ldquo;quartermaster&rdquo; and &ldquo;commander&rdquo;, which are not that  different from &ldquo;principal&rdquo;. Recently, we have seen that Sinn F&eacute;in does like  titles. We now have the Baron of somewhere or other &mdash; Northstead &mdash; or the  Steward of Northstead. Now, to add to that quota, we are to have the prized  possession of a position without function, rhyme or reason, that of Principal  Deputy Speaker. Those who are in cahoots with Sinn F&eacute;in will vote it through  because that is the deal that they made. That is the reality of this debate.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I always thought that the members of the Alliance Party  were the veritable paragons of equality; they were the cheerleaders of power  sharing, rotation and sharing.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Only when it suits.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  Yes, and what suits today is to prop up the cabal that puts it in the position  that it occupies in the House. It is a surprising shame on the Alliance Party  that today it eschews its own principles and leaves it to lesser mortals like  me to dare to raise the standard for equality in the House. The Alliance Party: how the  have mighty fallen when it has come to this. I implore them that the sense of  equality that I exude might imbue them &mdash; they sit close enough &mdash; and that they  might vote in accordance with those principles.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Someone said that there was an argument against democracy  in the amendment. It really beggars belief that you should elevate someone to a  position because you have done a deal about it that means nothing in terms of  function, that has no definable role, yet that one day might be paid. Someone  pointed out that it could not be paid; that is not true. That is under the  aegis of the independent review body.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The independent review body could well decide, shamefully  and wrongfully thanks to the votes of those who create the post, that it may be  a paid position even though it may not have a function. Perhaps that is part of  the demand; part of the deal. We have not seen the whole deal, the whole shoddy  arrangement that brought this about. Perhaps part of the deal is that it is  passed to the independent assessors through sleight of hand, so that some  Members can say that they washed their hands of it, but they know the full  extent of the deal they have done. They want to conceal anything that would  reveal that to the House, and they want to be careful that nothing derails it.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The challenge to those who have been unable to articulate a  reason, need, or purpose in making this appointment is why, if there is neither  function, purpose nor need for it, they want to gift it to their partner, Sinn  F&eacute;in. Have they so lost the run of themselves that all they are prepared to do  in this House is whatever it takes to keep Sinn F&eacute;in happy? If they vote  against this amendment that will be a demonstration of that, because they will  be saying that they want to have a Sinn F&eacute;in Deputy Speaker for three years. Is  anyone in the House capable of rising above the designation of mere Lobby  fodder? We will see in a moment or two.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  The Procedures Committee was asked by the Assembly on 16 May to table the  necessary amendments to Standing Orders to provide for the appointment of a  Principal Deputy Speaker. You would not realise that that was what we were  charged to do from listening to today&rsquo;s debate, but that is what we were asked  to do, and I thank the Committee staff for their work, for the report that was  produced and for the co-operation that they afforded to Members.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">We are all aware that the proposed amendments to Standing  Orders before us are not unusual; in fact, they bring the Assembly into line  with several other jurisdictions. The first of those is, as some Members have  said while others will not recognise it, the House of Commons in Westminster. It has three  Deputy Speaker posts: the principal Deputy Speaker is designated the Chairman  of Ways and Means, and the other two Deputy Speakers are simply known as First  and Second Deputy Chairmen.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  The three offices in the House of Commons that you have referred to are defined  in the Deputy Speaker Act 1855 and have individual functions. You are trying to  create a title without function. Will you please explain why you are doing  that, or do the terms of the deal between you and Sinn F&eacute;in have to remain  absolutely and utterly secret?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  We were charged to look at the position of Principal Deputy Speaker, and that  is what we have done. That legislation may be done differently in Westminster, but we have  provided for the position of Principal Deputy Speaker.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The second institution is the Canadian House of Commons,  where the Speaker is also supported by three Deputy Speakers with different  status.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I have listened carefully to the Member. He said: &ldquo;we have provided for the  position of Principal Deputy Speaker.&rdquo; Will he tell the House the difference  between the position of Principal Deputy Speaker and that of any other Speaker,  except for the title? What, apart from the title, is the specific difference?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  Again, there is no difference other than the title. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> Do you want a definition or not?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. Allow the Member to continue.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  I am sorry, Mr Speaker. They asked a question, and I was trying to afford them  the answer as I see it. The post of Principal Deputy Speaker was created so  that when the Speaker is not able to fulfil his role, he can call on a  particular individual, as opposed to calling on one of three Deputy Speakers.  It makes perfect sense to those who can understand; those who do not want to  understand never will.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson explained the rationale behind the three  motions when introducing the amendments. The Chair highlighted the fact that  the amendment proposed to the third motion is a substantive provision. That is  the provision that will create Standing Order 5A to provide the role of  Principal Deputy Speaker. The first two motions are merely paving amendments  for the third motion and do not alter the effect on Standing Orders at all.  Rather, they move a provision currently found in Standing Order 1 to Standing  Order 5.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I will provide a recap of some of the points that were  made. The Committee discussions were very interesting, albeit the meetings were  fairly short. When I first went to the Committee meetings, it was like sitting  in a court room watching two barristers cross-examining another barrister.  Although declarations of interest were made at the meetings, I sometimes  wondered whether those two members actually thought that they were still being  paid to be barristers from how they were conducting themselves. By the end of the  meetings, I was not sure whether to look to the bottom of the table to the  person who had been charged by the Assembly to give legal advice or to look  opposite me to those who thought that they were there to give legal advice.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  I would have done better.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  I hear him saying from a sedentary position that he might have done better.  Maybe he would have done better in the courts than he did in the election, when  he got in on the ninth count and depended on DUP votes. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  Then we come to Mr Gardiner. I was going to say that he made his point well,  but I am afraid he did not make any point; all he did was to rehearse an old  argument that has been lost. On, I believe, the only day that he was at the  Committee, he referred to the House of Commons and its size and then to the  size of this place, which he did again today. Casting my mind back to 1998, I  believe that his party was at the helm and created the positions that exist  here and the functions of this House. So, if there are too many Assembly  Members &mdash; my party has consistently been on the record as saying that there  should be a reduction in the number of MLAs and Departments &mdash; it was the Ulster  Unionists that created the problem.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Let us try to stick to the motion before us.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  I am slightly disappointed that I did not get the same latitude as others, but  I am happy to move on.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Chris Lyttle supported the motion, and Paul Givan also made  a valuable contribution.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">To bring Danny Kinahan up to speed: this House has three  Deputy Speakers, not four. So, if we are going to take lessons from Danny  Kinahan, maybe he should learn how many positions we are talking about. The  amendment he supports refers to rotating positions; he is going to rotate four  Deputy Speakers, but, as far as I am aware, there are only three positions.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Gerry Kelly also referred to lawyers. I wonder whether he  has come to the same conclusion as me: certain members of the Committee were  moonlighting and thought that they were not in the Assembly.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Steven Agnew &mdash; we will just skip over that one.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Jim Allister referred to me as &ldquo;Lobby fodder&rdquo;. I have gone  to the electorate twice and have been elected twice. The first time that I went  to the electorate, I did reasonably well. The second time I went to the  electorate, I did so on the same principle, and guess what? I got elected on  the first count and over quota. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order, order. Allow the Member to be heard. Order.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  Everybody &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  Reference has been made today to the public and to the Good Friday Agreement in  1998 and all these other events. I am proud to be in the DUP, and I am proud of  some of the changes that have been made in this establishment. However,  reference has been made to what the public want. I think of the contribution  that Mr Allister just made and the change that he has made in three weeks. I  have to give him credit: he did get a resounding vote when he put himself  forward for election after he left the DUP. However, when people got fed up  listening to the tired old rhetoric of this man, they gave him the vote that he  deserved. He came in on his knees, elected by a vote that was lent to him by  the DUP &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order, order.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  That is how this man got elected &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order, order.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Do Standing Orders not recognise us as equals,  or are we getting another lecture in fundamental inequality from the DUP?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order, order. I appreciate the fact that the Member is making a winding-up  speech on the motions and is trying to answer Members&rsquo; questions. I understand  that. However, as far as possible, please try to stick to the motions. It is  understandable that the Member has to widen the debate out slightly to respond  to what Members said earlier.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  Thank you for that, Mr Speaker. Like other Members, I was just trying to lay  out my case in answering some of today&rsquo;s critics.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The point that I was trying to make about Mr Allister&rsquo;s  contribution is that the people have spoken, have given this party a voice and  believe in the direction that it has taken. Maybe the Ulster Unionists should  also listen to this point. The people have recognised the fact that the Ulster  Unionists are in absolute meltdown mode, which is why they are scratching their  heads today and wondering why, joining Jim Allister and others &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order, order. I must insist that the Member sticks to the business on the Floor  of the House. You need to do that.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  Today&rsquo;s issue is not whether the role of Principal Deputy Speaker be created.  That debate has happened and the decision has already been taken by  cross-community support in the Chamber. The purpose of today&rsquo;s debate is to be  certain that the proposed changes to Standing Orders meet the needs of the  Assembly because they will apply to us all.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  No, I will not give way.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The amendments achieve that and in some way merely  formalise a process that already happens in practice. On occasion, I believe  that they will also simplify issues surrounding the order in which delegation  of duties by the Speaker occurs, but that is, of course, a matter for the Speaker&rsquo;s  discretion.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Members have had the opportunity to examine the report  produced by the Committee to inform the debate. That details the Committee&rsquo;s  deliberations, the options considered and what the Committee finally agreed,  often by majority. However, the work has been done, and I will briefly  summarise.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee has suggested separating the two purposes  currently performed by Standing Order 1(3) so it will serve only an  interpretative function. The Committee has also suggested a protocol for addressing  the Principal Deputy Speaker and has required a new Standing Order 5A to be  drafted. That is designed to cover the selection and replacement of the  Principal Deputy Speaker as well as the mode of address function. The Committee  proposed no change in allowance. I take Mr Allister&rsquo;s point about the panel  that has been set up to deal with that issue. Importantly, that proposal was  supported by all sides at the meeting, and if we have the opportunity, we will  not support any remuneration for the position.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The idea of formalising which Deputy Speaker would deputise  for the Speaker under different circumstances was considered at length. The  Committee ultimately agreed that that would remain at the discretion of the  Speaker. I will clarify. I find it amazing that there was disagreement today  about the issue of function. It was the same Members who did not want the  creation of a Principal Deputy Speaker who wanted us to tie down a function for  the position. If we followed that path and created a function for the position,  it would be easier for someone to be remunerated. So the Committee decided not  to create a function that would differentiate between the Principal Deputy  Speaker and the Deputy Speakers and instead leave that to the discretion of the  Speaker.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As we wind up the debate, I remind Members that the changes  that I summarised that are detailed in the motions are the issue in hand. The  question is not whether the role be created but to be certain that the proposed  changes to Standing Orders meet the letter and spirit of the motion agreed in  the Chamber on 16 May. I support the motion.</p>

        <p class="OralAnswers-H2DepartmentHeading">Environment</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Planning Applications</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-Question">1. <strong>Ms J  McCann </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment how the redeployment of staff  from Planning Service has impacted on the processing of planning applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 91/11-15<a name="AQO91/11-15" id="AQO91/11-15"></a>)</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood (The  Minister of the Environment)</strong>: I thank the Member for her question and  welcome her back to the Assembly. The simple answer is that the redeployment of  staff in the Planning Service has begun to have an impact on the processing of  planning applications. Although I am advised that the Planning Service has done  good work over recent years to speed up the handling of applications of all  natures, evidence is beginning to emerge that the redeployment of staff and  other factors have combined to create circumstances in which the better  performance in the Department in managing all sizes of planning applications  has now gone into reverse. Further detailed information on that will be made  available over the summer, and I will provide copies of that information to the  membership of the Environment Committee.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The management of planning applications has now become more  visible, and a number of applications have been brought to my attention and  received responses from me. Given that, I reassure all Members that those  matters are being and will continue to be looked at and managed in a way that  mitigates the impact of that redeployment.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer and congratulate him on his new  appointment. Does he believe that sufficient expertise and experience has been  retained to ensure a consistent approach to new policies such as PPS 21?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I thank the Member for that supplementary question. I am interrogating the  management of PPS 21 in particular, because the anecdotal evidence is that  there has been some inconsistency in planning decisions between planning  offices. If the Member or any other Member has any further information in that  regard, I would very much welcome hearing from them.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I will go further, however, and say that, in recent times &mdash;  even this morning &mdash; I have been applying my mind to determining whether there  are potential variations in PPS 21 that do not breach in any significant way  the intention or ambition of the planning policy but do, nonetheless, create  some greater flexibility for non-farming rural dwellers. There is an  opportunity to identify further moderate interventions that could see not just  consistency in the application of the policy but some betterment in the conduct  of the policy to enable those with a legitimate interest in living in a rural  area to have the opportunity so to do.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire  as an fhreagra a thug s&eacute; d&uacute;inn.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister tell me what the current budgetary  position is for income from planning fees?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I thank the Member for that question. Compared with the height of fee income  from planning applications and property certificates in and around three or  four years ago, the loss of receipts coming into the Department means that that  budget is down 40%. That is clearly working itself through into the overall  budgetary position in both the Planning Service and the Department. However, I  reassure the Member that, whatever the budgetary situation, I believe, as I  always said in my previous role, that a Minister&rsquo;s responsibility is to be in  government and in power. If there are some further ways in which the power of  the office can be used to assist the processing of planning applications, I  will try to deploy that power. For example, I have instructed officials that,  whatever the Programme for Government might or might not say when eventually we  have one, we will create new performance indicators now around the management  of all sorts of planning application.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">On the basis of Civil Service advice, a target was set for  timeliness regarding various planning applications, but I am not content,  necessarily, that those time limits and time lines are right. If we can  interrogate them in a way that forces the pace of planning applications so that  they are assessed more quickly than they are at the moment &mdash; it is better than  it used to be, subject to what I have just said &mdash; we should go there. If there  are critical cases in the North of Ireland where the consensus in a planning  district is that there needs to be some upgrade in respect of staff, especially  where there is a strong view across parties that particular members of staff  were very helpful in their previous role, I will ask my permanent secretary to  consider whether there are opportunities for redeployment back into those areas  in an effort to help.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dunne</strong>: I  congratulate the Minister on his appointment. Are there any plans to relocate  the Downpatrick planning office, as a large section of its work is now managed  by the Belfast area planning office?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I thank the Member and congratulate him on his election to the Assembly. The  answer to that question is &ldquo;Not to my knowledge&rdquo;. In fact, the contrary is the  case. One of my ambitions as Minister is to identify opportunities, as I did in  a moderate way when I was Minister for Social Development, to redeploy staff  out of the major urban location of Belfast. I believe that there is an  opportunity, subject to all necessary consultations with the staff affected, to  see whether we can redeploy staff to other parts of Northern Ireland in the way  that we pursued the decentralisation agenda.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I have also tasked my officials with identifying all assets  of the DOE estate to identify whether there are opportunities when it comes to  other initiatives that the Department undertakes to deploy staff or to locate  activities outside the greater Belfast area in a way that will see  opportunities for decentralisation to grow. If there are opportunities in the  north-west, west or south-east, I would like to see if we can do it in those  areas. If there is anything further in respect of the Downpatrick situation  that I think I should bring to the attention of the Member, I will do so in  writing.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  understand that the Northern Ireland Environment Agency entered a contract with  a number of archaeologists who enabled the Department to scrutinise  applications in relation to archaeological matters. The agency ended the  contract on 31 May, but it will not start again until the end of the year. Will  the Minister advise us who will deal with the applications in relation to  archaeological matters?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I can confirm to the Member that there have been issues not just regarding  archaeological assessments but in wider assessments of built heritage where the  budgetary situation has given rise to some issues and difficulties in a way  that concerns me. The opportunity to scope out what the built heritage is,  where the assets are and what we need to do to protect them may be put off for  a significant time &mdash; too long, in my view.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In respect of the question that she raised, I will come  back to her in more substance in writing.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Before moving on to our next question, I inform Members that  questions 5 and 9 have been withdrawn and will require written answers.</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Waste Management: Incineration</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-Question">2. <strong>Mrs  Dobson </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment for his assessment of the use  of incineration as a form of waste management.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  92/11-15<a name="AQO92/11-15" id="AQO92/11-15"></a>)</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I thank the Member for her question and congratulate her on her election to the  Assembly. Given that there are a number of live procurements in respect of  waste management through the three clusters of councils, the Member will  appreciate that I need to be careful about what I say in answer to her  question.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In respect of taking waste management forward &mdash;  incineration in particular &mdash; I will look at any recommendations that come  forward to the Department. I will assess any proposal against the current  planning and wider policies. I will determine whether it is sustainable and  does not jeopardise any further opportunities for recycling. I will assess any  proposals for waste incineration by judging them against what is known as the  waste hierarchy.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">That said, I want opportunities for waste management and  recycling to be exploited more during my tenure. Although Belfast has a domestic  waste recycling rate of 30%, comparable cities in Britain, such as Cardiff,  have a recycling rate of 40%. Particularly if we go down the road of  reorganising local government, I want to see how we can push the new councils,  in the run-up to that reorganisation, to up their game on recycling, reusing  and maximising opportunities that could mitigate the need for incineration. I  should point out that incineration is not merely a matter of burning waste, and  opportunities to get energy from waste make the incinerator option more  attractive.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Dobson</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer. Will he clarify the future plans for  incineration in Northern Ireland? In particular, how does he intend to address  concerns raised by Almac Pharmaceuticals about Re-Gen Waste&rsquo;s proposed  construction of a material recovery facility beside its site in Portadown?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  As the Member may be aware, the three waste management groups that reflect the  interests of local councils in the North have ongoing procurements for potential  incineration plants. I am not a Minister minded in all circumstances to turn  down any application for an incinerator. I will set any proposal that comes  forward, if any does, against the standards and principles that I have just  outlined: is it consistent with policy, is it a disincentive to recycling, and  is it a sustainable and efficient model going forward? In coming to a  recommendation on each proposal for an incinerator, I will consider those  factors.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I will write to the Member in more detail on the Almac  matter. However, if we are able to keep on the right side of European law,  there are increasing opportunities for all-Ireland incineration and recycling.  There is a major incinerator in County Meath, and there will be one in Dublin.  I understand that both may have excess capacity. If we are able to move forward  in a way that creates not only opportunities in the North but, potentially,  opportunities on the island that are consistent with European transport and  other environmental directives, I am keen to scope that out to determine  whether good evidence exists for going in that direction.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the Minister to his  first Question Time in his new office.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Recently, Minister, you kindly responded in writing to a  question that I asked you shortly after you came into office about Rose  Energy&rsquo;s application to build an incinerator at Glenavy, on the shores of Lough  Neagh. You said that you would consider expert advice following an assessment  of submissions made by the applicant and by the considerable lobby opposed to  the incinerator. Given that the proposed incineration plant has proved hugely  controversial, as part of your careful consideration of the application, would  you consider it helpful to commission an objective study of alternative means  of treating poultry waste?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I thank the Member for his question and kind words. I welcome the fact that he  acknowledges, as I do, that poultry litter disposal is something that we just have  to deal with. Let me reiterate to the Member what I said in response to a  question tabled in the Assembly: when I have receipt of the expert advice from  the consultees on the submissions by the applicant and third parties, I will  make an assessment based on the recommendation of officials.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I note the particular proposal that the Member makes. It  has not come across my desk heretofore. I will ask my officials to investigate  that proposal to see whether it would enhance the information available to me  as Minister in making an assessment of the matter. Beyond that, I will make no  further commitment at this stage, given that it is crucial that I keep on the  right side of due process and good evidence in the matter.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  Minister, can you assure the House that you have no fixed ideological position  on the matter? In particular, will you be mindful of the very special needs of  the agriculture sector and, within that, the poultry sector? Will you take care  not to fall into the trap of perpetual delay in reaching essential decisions?  Will you remain mindful of the severe risk of EU infraction proceedings if we  do not adequately deal with the poultry litter problem?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I thank the Member and welcome him to the Assembly. I confirm that I have some  ideological positions, and I am not afraid to have them. Perhaps, in the the  next few months, you and I could have some conversations, one way or the other,  about ideological positions. Perhaps mine might even prevail over yours.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I would not bank on it.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  Precisely. My experience as an SDLP politician has always been to travel more  in hope than in expectation. I assure the House that, when it comes to talking  to Mr Allister, that is definitely the basis on which I would have the  conversation.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I do not fall into traps around delay. When I was Social  Development Minister, I tried to demonstrate that there was a difference  between going into government and going into power, a difference that, in my  view, Ministers did not fully appreciate. One of the differences is that, when  you go into power, you do not allow yourself to become a captive of delay. I  assure the Member that, if there is any reason to be concerned about delay, it  should be brought to my attention. However, it will not be the measure against  which I will proceed.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I note what the Member says about infraction proceedings. I  assure the House that I have enquired generally within my Department whether  any infraction proceedings are pending or might arise in respect of any activity  or function of the Department, and I have been reassured in that regard. I  refer to what I said to Mr McLaughlin about the management of the issue. I  await best advice. When I get it, mindful of the proposal made by Mr  McLaughlin, I will advise the House further.</p>

        <p class="OralAnswers-Question">3. <strong>Mrs D  Kelly </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment whether he has any plans to  introduce legislation to give increased scrutiny powers to the local government  auditor to help improve the financial accountability of local authorities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 93/11-15<a name="AQO93/11-15" id="AQO93/11-15"></a>)</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I thank the Member for her question. Let me say to the House that, irrespective  of what happens with the RPA, the shape and character of the RPA and the powers  of the local government auditor in the event of the reorganisation of local  councils, if Members have any issues with the conduct of any council that, they  believe, needs to be investigated now &mdash; whether it is the council of which the  Member was a member, the council of which I was a member or the councils of  which many people in this Chamber are still members &mdash; they should bring it to  the attention either of the auditor or of my office. I remind Members that,  unlike the auditor in Britain, the local government auditor in Northern Ireland  still has the opportunity to surcharge councillors. Whatever about future  scrutiny powers, one of the current scrutiny powers is that the local  government auditor has the opportunity and ability to surcharge. We should not  be coy about that. If councils are on the wrong side of good practice and  performance, let the matter be investigated. If there is something that needs  further remedy, let it be addressed.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">At the Committee Stage of the Local Government Finance  Bill, the former Minister made a commitment to deal with the issue raised by  Mrs Kelly. I await advice on enhancing the power of the local government  auditor. If reorganisation happens, it is already the case that the local  government auditor will have an assurance and assessment role in councils&rsquo;  compliance regarding service delivery and performance improvement. If good  evidence and best advice shows that there is a need for further legislation to  enhance all that, I will not shirk from going in that direction.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his reassurance. It will be no surprise to him that I  have many concerns about the behaviour of Craigavon Borough Council, of which I  was a member for nearly 17 years. The Minister will be well aware that councils  across the North have substantial land banks as well as having a certain role  to play in area planning and town centre boundaries.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Can we have a question, please?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I urge the Minister to ensure that the local government auditor has real-time  investigative powers. I also ask him for a commitment that his Department will  carry out an analysis of the role and function of the local government auditor  vis-&agrave;-vis the Comptroller and Auditor General at the Assembly.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I thank the Member. I have some sense of her concerns about the council that  she named, as well as similar concerns held by other Members about one or two  other councils. All accountability mechanisms that exist in the North need  teeth, whether local government auditor, Police Ombudsman or any others. If  there is good reason to give more powers to the local government auditor going  forward, I would be minded to do so.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I note the points that the Member made in the latter part  of her question, and I will look at those matters further. I also note what she  said about land banks. Bearing in mind the asset base that councils do and will  have, we need to make sure that the management of those assets, including land  banks, fulfils all appropriate and high standards. However, there is a wider  political point: if we go in the direction of RPA, I have a sense that a  cluster of councils is preparing itself for that direction of travel. They will  do so in confidence, using the powers that they already have to ensure that  there is good performance and best value for money and in a way that properly  addresses any issues of concern. I have a sense that some councils and staff  are more interested in competing for territory and status than they are in  competing on behalf of the citizens and ratepayers whom they represent. I hope  that, if we go in the direction of RPA, those councils will embrace the best  standards and performance of their colleagues.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>: I  know the Minister would agree that 99&middot;9% of functions exercised by councils are  carried out to the highest possible standards. It is important that there is  financial probity. Will he check with the local government auditor whether he  is still prepared to use the surcharge function? I understand that, after  losing a case, he indicated that he would not use the function again because he  was overruled on it. Secondly, does the Minister agree &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind Members that they should ask only one question.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>: I  believe that some councils are seeking to gift land, at no charge, to the GAA.  Will the Minister make sure that there is financial probity in those  transactions?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I thank the Member. I confirm that I signed off on four disposals of land or  property by councils to the GAA and other organisations in the past two weeks.  Given the financial situation that many sporting and other organisations face,  I asked officials to check, on the basis of good practice and evidence, whether  there are opportunities to dispose of lands, buildings or parts of buildings in  council areas, not necessarily at nil value or rent but at a more advantageous  value or rent. It seems to me that, if councils or government have an asset  base, there may be opportunities in these times of difficulty and less money to  enable community, sporting and other organisations to fulfil their purpose and  serve their members, whatever their background.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I do not like it when a Member, when making a comment about  the disposal of land or buildings, particularises one organisation. That is  partial, selective and partisan; it is not in keeping with the standards that  this Chamber upholds or with the standards that my Department or councils, by  and large, uphold. I regret that remark.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I note what the Member said in respect of the local  government auditor and will probe the matter further. An independent accounting  auditor may have powers, but the fact that he loses a case should not lead to  the conclusion that he never used his powers at all.</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Road Safety</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-Question">4. <strong>Mr  McCartney </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment what road safety measures  he intends to introduce during this Assembly term.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 94/11-15<a name="AQO94/11-15" id="AQO94/11-15"></a>)</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I thank the Member for that question. I will shorten my answer to give the  Member the opportunity to come back with a supplementary question.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I am minded to introduce new road safety measures during  this Assembly term. Although we continue to scope those out in the Department,  one example is the introduction of further measures to deter drink-driving.  Perhaps we should not only reduce the minimum level of alcohol in a person&rsquo;s  blood that can lead to prosecution for certain designated drivers, such as  R-drivers, but introduce a requirement for a blood-alcohol reading of nil to  avoid prosecution. Nil does not necessarily mean a zero reading, as there are  reasons, such as the taking of medicines, that could lead to partial traces of  alcohol in a person&rsquo;s blood. Reducing the blood-alcohol level required for  prosecution is an area that we should explore.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire  as an fhreagra sin. I welcome the Minister in his new role. I also welcome the  fact that he has outlined some of the issues that he intends to raise. Does he  have a timeline for doing that? Does he have any intention of meeting his  colleague in Dublin to share his proposals, particularly those that would be  strengthened if they were rolled out on a cross-border basis?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I thank the Member for his comments and his question. The answer to his second  question is yes. At a North/South Ministerial Council sectoral meeting on the  environment on 1 July, I am scheduled to meet the Minister for the Environment,  Community and Local Government, Phil Hogan. Independent of that, we have  scheduled a further meeting on 4 July, at which we will be able to scope what  further can be done.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">At the margins of the NSMC meeting, I spoke to Minister  Hogan on Friday, and, in a very short time, we were able to scope out a number  of interventions on an all-Ireland basis that would benefit our citizens, North  and South. For example, it would be better to align blood-alcohol limits across  these islands. However, I have indicated to officials that, given that we share  a land border with the Republic of Ireland, we should not unnecessarily delay  doing what we want for Britain; we should go ahead with doing that with the  Republic of Ireland.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Given the good work of previous Ministers to ensure that  there is mutual recognition of disqualification, we need to push on with the  mutual recognition of penalty points on a North/South basis, if not on an all-island  basis. The all-island freight forum is a crucial measure in road safety.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">My intention is for Minister Hogan and myself to, within a  month, map out and announce, subject to his agreement, a pathway for  all-Ireland road safety.</p>

        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind Members that the Minister of Finance and Personnel has  advised of his unavailability today due to his attendance at the funeral of  Brian Lenihan. The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment will be  answering questions on his behalf.</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Budget Review Group</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-Question">1. <strong>Ms  Boyle </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel what issues he has raised  at meetings of the Budget review group to date.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  105/11-15<a name="AQO105/11-15" id="AQO105/11-15"></a>)</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-Question">8. <strong>Mr  Lynch </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel whether the Budget review  group is considering the opportunities that exist to apply for European Union  funding to help raise revenue.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  112/11-15<a name="AQO112/11-15" id="AQO112/11-15"></a>)</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-Question">14. <strong>Mrs  McKevitt </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel how much has been  realised to date through the implementation of revenue-raising measures that  have been recommended by the Budget review group.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 118/11-15<a name="AQO118/11-15" id="AQO118/11-15"></a>)</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster (The  Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment)</strong>: I want to group this  question with questions 8 and 14.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The first meeting of the newly constituted Budget review  group under this mandate will take place on 15 June. At that meeting, Ministers  will need to take stock of the Budget review group commitments made by the  previous mandate and the specific projects that need to be addressed as a matter  of urgency. The Minister of Finance and Personnel will be anxious to see how  those Departments with explicit Budget review group commitments incorporate  within their Budget settlements the work that they have been asked to take  forward. There is some &pound;900 million of additional revenue-raising measures to  be delivered over the coming four-year period, which include the plastic bag  levy, capital receipts from the sale and disposal of assets and contributions  from the Port of Belfast and housing associations.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">At the meeting, the Minister will also raise the need to  pursue those other revenue-raising proposals advanced but not sufficiently  robust enough to reflect in the Budget settlement. An important element of that  will undoubtedly be an exploration of all options to maximise the drawdown of  European Union funding streams that are open to the Executive to exploit. There  is much merit in some of those proposals, and the Budget review group needs to  examine them thoroughly.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Boyle</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for her answer.  Did the Minister of Finance and Personnel raise the issue of asset disposals  with his Southern counterpart at last Friday&rsquo;s North/South Ministerial Council  (NSMC) plenary meeting, particularly in relation to the National Asset  Management Agency (NAMA)?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  As the Member knows, the Finance Minister has had a good working relationship  with his counterpart in the Republic of Ireland on NAMA issues. In that  respect, it is appropriate to pay tribute to Brian Lenihan&rsquo;s work with our  Finance Minister on NAMA. He allowed Sammy to have access to some issues to  which officials originally would not allow him access. It is right and timely  that I should pay tribute to Brian Lenihan.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I am not aware whether the Finance Minister raised issues  with his counterpart at the North/South Ministerial Council. The issue was  certainly not on the agenda, so it probably was not raised at the meeting.  However, the Finance Minister will want to see how assets will be realised in  Northern Ireland because they are part of the &pound;900 million Budget commitment.  We will want to explore those matters at tomorrow afternoon&rsquo;s Budget review  group meeting.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McKevitt</strong>:  What is the current outlook for raising revenue from the Port of Belfast?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  The Member will be aware that the contribution that is being asked of the Port  of Belfast is some &pound;40 million. Negotiations are still ongoing between the Port  of Belfast and the Department. The Finance Minister is leading on the issue, and  he will continue to push the Port of Belfast for its share of the Budget  settlement. We believe that the assets are there, and the Minister will  continue the negotiations and will no doubt advise his colleagues who sit on  the Budget review group of their progress.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lynch</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Will the Minister indicate when the  Assembly can expect results from the review of arm&rsquo;s-length bodies?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  That is an agenda item for tomorrow&rsquo;s meeting. From my experience, I know that  the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister has tasked every  Department to supply information on their arm&rsquo;s-length bodies. Questions were  asked as to the effectiveness of those arm&rsquo;s-length bodies and whether there  was a statutory need for all of them. All that information has been collated,  as I understand it, and sent to the Office of the First Minister and deputy  First Minister, and that matter is on the agenda for tomorrow&rsquo;s meeting.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Anderson</strong>:  The Minister referred in her initial response to housing associations. How do  the Executive propose to access the housing associations&rsquo; reserves?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  That matter caused much discussion at the time. I well recall listening to the  housing associations say that that was something that could not be done, that  we did not have legal grounds to do it, and all manner of claims. However, as  the Member will know, the Budget review group (BRG) in the previous mandate  very much identified the possibility of deploying the housing associations&rsquo; financial  reserves, which are quite considerable, and we believed there was a need to  look at ways of using that more effectively.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I think that there was a misunderstanding at the time that  we would come along and dip into the bank accounts of housing associations.  That certainly was not the way in which we saw this going forward. It is not a  question of directly accessing the reserves. Rather, the way in which it is  happening is that the grant paid to housing associations has been set at &pound;20  million per annum lower than it would otherwise have been set. That, we hope,  will encourage housing associations to use their reserves to make up the  shortfall in moneys coming from the Government. That is how the Department of  Finance and Personnel is dealing with the issue of housing associations and  their reserves.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her answer. She mentioned earlier that there were  robust options that did not make it into the Budget. Will she give us examples  of additional revenue-raising options that have been identified by the BRG?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  Many other options, some robust and some not so robust, were considered by the  Budget review group and Finance Minister. At the meeting tomorrow, as I  understand it, the group will look at the latest position on, for example, the  review of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive, which is one of the options  that it wishes to look at. It will also look at work in relation to the Odyssey  Trust Company to take forward suggestions that were made there.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, different political parties raised other issues,  be they mobile phone mast charges or levying a charge on non-exempt ATMs.  However, all those matters have to be subject to rigorous examination and, in  some cases, possibly legal opinion to see whether the matter can be taken  forward. So, they will be robustly challenged. They are not in the Budget at  present because the Finance Minister did not feel at that time that they were  robust enough. So, they will be looking at all those options again tomorrow  afternoon.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Before moving on to our next question, I advise Members that  questions 3, 4 and 10 have been withdrawn and will require written answers.</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Small Business Rate Relief Scheme</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-Question">2. <strong>Miss M  McIlveen </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel what progress has been  made on the expansion of the small business rate relief scheme.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 106/11-15<a name="AQO106/11-15" id="AQO106/11-15"></a>)</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  Good progress has been made, and a paper setting out the preferred option of  the Finance Minister is with the Executive for consideration. Around &pound;6&middot;3  million is the current annual saving to small businesses under the main scheme,  helping around 16,000 businesses in Northern Ireland. The Finance Minister  would hope to be able to double the amount of relief and increase by over 50%  the numbers who receive help.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Given constrained public finances, the additional help  needs to be broadly cost-neutral to the Executive, and it is proposed to fund  the expansion of the small business rate relief scheme through a large-retail  levy. Large retailers are generally better placed than small businesses to cope  with the economic downturn. These measures need to be introduced as soon as  possible, and, with Executive support, the Finance Minister will be seeking  Assembly approval to have them in place by next April. They will apply for  three years, through to the end of the Budget period. Consultation will begin  soon on the way forward, and the Finance Minister hopes that final decisions  can be reached in the autumn.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss M McIlveen</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her answer. Wearing her normal hat, she will recognise  that small businesses are the backbone of our local towns and that any  assistance would be welcomed in the current climate. What is likely to be the  average benefit if such a scheme were introduced?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  I thank the Member for her question. I recognise the value of small businesses  to the Northern Ireland economy. Indeed, it was while visiting one of those  small towns &mdash; I do not know whether you would call Ballyclare a small town, Mr  Deputy Speaker; perhaps you can clarify. In any event, we visited Ballyclare  and when talking to some of the small businesses there I was surprised to hear  that the current small business rate relief scheme did not help some businesses  in that town.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It is good to see that the Finance Minister has decided to  expand the small business rate relief scheme, because that will make a real  difference to a lot of small businesses across Northern Ireland. The 20% relief  for those with a net asset value of &pound;5,000 to &pound;10,000 would give an average  award of &pound;730 at 2011-12 levels. The idea is that the hearts of villages, small  towns and bigger towns will be kept alive during what has been a very difficult  period for them. The small business rate relief scheme, from the Finance  Minister&rsquo;s point of view &mdash; and, indeed, from the economy Minister&rsquo;s point of  view &mdash; is a very good scheme, and it is one of which the Assembly should be  very proud.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  The Minister is correct; the smaller business rate relief scheme is something  that we could give significant support to, and, hopefully, the effect will be  to help sustain smaller businesses in town centres. She is also correct when  she says that that is predicated on a greater return from the retail levy,  which, again, is predicated on the rateable value of larger retail outlets.  Given that that may not be such an accurate barometer of how some of the larger  retail outlets are doing, does the Minister think that perhaps some element of  profitability should be added to the scheme? Although I think that it is a  valuable scheme and that it will have a good effect on smaller indigenous  businesses that are struggling, nonetheless it could potentially be a blunt  instrument that may act against some larger retailers that are perhaps not  doing so well in the circumstances.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  I thank the Member for that question, and welcome his support for the small  business rate relief scheme. To put it into perspective, the large-retail levy  is likely to affect fewer than 100 properties throughout Northern Ireland &mdash;  0&middot;1% of all non-domestic properties. My understanding is that it involves just  27 companies that have a combined UK sales turnover in excess of &pound;100 billion  per year. The impact that it will have on those 27 companies is minimal  compared to the amount of profit that they make year on year.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Having looked at the situation in the round and at how  larger businesses have been much more resilient than some of our small  businesses, which live from month to month in relation to their cash flow, I  believe that it is a substantial help for those small businesses and will be at  minimal cost to those larger businesses that will be asked to pay the levy.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>: I  welcome the Minister back again today. As well as the retail levy mentioned by  the Member who spoke previously, does the Minister foresee any opportunity for  adding an additional levy for large retailers that sell alcohol below cost  price on many occasions?</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  The Minister of Finance and Personnel will want to discuss that issue with the  Minister for Social Development. I know exactly what the Member is talking  about, because the issue of local retailers selling alcohol at below cost price  has been raised with me at constituency level.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I will take the Member&rsquo;s comments back to the Finance  Minister and ask him whether he has any plans to speak with the Minister for  Social Development. Presumably, that is also part and parcel of the debate  about minimum pricing in which the Minister for Social Development is involved.  The Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety has also indicated  that he wants to take the matter forward. The issue crosses a number of  Departments, but I am aware of it.</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Corporation Tax</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-Question">5. <strong>Mr T  Clarke </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel what discussions have  taken place between his Department and Her Majesty&rsquo;s Treasury on corporation  tax.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 109/11-15<a name="AQO109/11-15" id="AQO109/11-15"></a>)</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  The First Minister, the deputy First Minister, the Minister of Finance and  Personnel and I met David Gauke and Owen Paterson in February and March 2011 to  discuss the then draft &lsquo;Rebalancing the Northern Ireland economy&rsquo; paper, which  is currently out for public consultation, ending on 24 June. At those meetings,  we made it clear that the United Kingdom Government needed to work with the  Executive to look at the different options for varying corporation tax. We also  identified a need to examine the costs, which remain very high and at the upper  end of the previous estimates. We asked that the paper be more explicit about  the benefits that we might expect. Further work is needed in those areas, and  we will continue to engage with the Treasury in that regard following the close  of the consultation.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">More recently, we all attended a consultation event in  London on 8 June, which was chaired by the Exchequer Secretary, at which we  heard views from multinational businesses and other private sector stakeholders  on the impact that a corporation tax reduction would have on the attractiveness  and ease of doing business in Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  I thank the Minister for the response to that question. Given that many  experts, elected and unelected, have expressed opinions about a reduction in  the rate of corporation tax, what impact does she expect a lower rate will have  on Northern Ireland&rsquo;s attractiveness as a location for inward investment?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  I do not have any doubt, nor do most of the commentators in the business world,  that reducing the rate of corporation tax in Northern Ireland would have a  significant benefit to the economy. The question then is whether that benefit  is greater than the cost to the block grant. The independent evidence that I  have in my Department &mdash; it is important to say that it is independent &mdash; leads  me to believe that a lower rate of corporation tax would be of huge benefit to  Northern Ireland in a number of ways. It would bring more foreign direct  investment and many more jobs into the economy. My economic advisory group has  indicated that it could create up to as many as 4,500 new jobs every year. It  would increase our productivity levels, so the productivity gap between us and  the rest of the United Kingdom would close. That is something that we set as a  target as far back as 2007, at the start of devolution. That convergence of  living standards would be something that all people in Northern Ireland,  regardless of where they live or what they do for a living, would feel. For me,  that is the key part of obtaining a reduction in the rate of corporation tax.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">However, the consultation is continuing. As I understand it  from my Department, the closing date for the consultation has been extended to  1 July 2011. That will give businesses and, indeed, everyone else the  opportunity to engage in that consultation with the Treasury, after which there  will still be much detailed work to do on how the corporation tax reduction  will, hopefully, happen in Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I detect a slight difference  in emphasis in the enthusiasm for a reduction in corporation tax between the  Enterprise Minister and the Finance Minister. Be that as it may &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Can we have a question, please?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  In the Minister&rsquo;s view, what measures can be introduced to ensure that Northern  Ireland is not subject to a rash of the practice known as brass plating,  whereby companies seek to gain advantage from the lower rate of corporation tax  without the accompanying economic activity?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  The Member is absolutely right; that is one of the key issues that we need to  sort out after the consultation is over. As the Member will know, there are two  stages to it: the principle of devolving corporation tax to Northern Ireland,  and sorting out the details of how much will come off the block grant and how  we will administer it in Northern Ireland. For instance, will Northern Ireland  have a separate administration to deal with those issues? So, there are a lot  of details to be sorted out between ourselves and the Treasury.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I have to say that I laughed a little when I read today&rsquo;s  &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo;, which said that the First Minister is the nice cop, the  Finance Minister is the nasty cop, and I am the even nicer cop. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> The &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo; is now high on my list  &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Have they met you?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  Mr Hamilton wants to know whether they have met me.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Obviously, the Finance Minister is charged with the public  finances of Northern Ireland, and, therefore, he will be concerned about the  cost of devolving corporation tax. As the economy Minister, my job is to build  the Northern Ireland economy and to try to close the productivity gap between  ourselves and the rest of the United Kingdom. That is my primary aim and why,  having looked at the independent evidence, I believe that reducing corporation  tax will bring about benefits for Northern Ireland that we would otherwise not  achieve.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Agnew</strong>:  Will the Minister confirm that, as well as the cost to the block grant,  Northern Ireland will be asked to bear the burden of the extra administration  cost of implementing a reduction in corporation tax? Furthermore, are there any  estimates of how much that cost will be?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  As I said in answer to the previous question, those are the issues that we need  to sort out with the Treasury. Interestingly, last week&rsquo;s consultation was attended  by some of the major multi-nationals, and their tax advisers said that they did  not see any difficulty in administrating a different tax rate in Northern  Ireland from that in the rest of the United Kingdom. However, they were very  clear about wanting a single point of contact in the United Kingdom to deal  with their company&rsquo;s tax issues, and they felt that a differential tax rate in  Northern Ireland could be dealt with quite easily from London.</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Corporation Tax: Block Grant</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-Question">6. <strong>Mr  Elliott </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel to outline why the  estimates provided by Her Majesty&rsquo;s Treasury, on the potential cost to the  Northern Ireland block grant of a reduction in the level of corporation tax,  differ significantly from his Department&rsquo;s estimates. (AQO 110/11-15<a name="AQO110/11-15" id="AQO110/11-15"></a>)</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  The first point to make is that both figures are estimates. Last year,  corporation tax figures were included in a Department of Finance and Personnel  (DFP) report on Northern Ireland&rsquo;s fiscal deficit. The analysis detailed in  that report applied a methodology developed by the Scottish Government for  estimating their fiscal deficit. Although that approach was agreed with the  Office for National Statistics, it involved making some high level assumptions  in allocating tax revenues, as regional tax data is not routinely published by  Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and was not available at that time.  The Treasury estimates included in the Government&rsquo;s consultation document were  produced using a different methodology. Although there are also caveats  attached to those figures, they are based on a detailed analysis of actual tax  receipts by postcode that was previously unavailable. That said, further work  is needed to find out precisely how much corporation tax is collected in Northern  Ireland, and I will be pressing the Treasury to urgently take that exercise  forward.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her answer. Obviously, there is still some work to be  done. Has the Department sought legal advice on the Azores ruling, and, if so,  how does it affect the outline proposals?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  The Azores ruling is fundamental in that, if Northern Ireland is to get a  differential tax rate, an amount of money must come out of our block grant to  reflect that. The Department of Finance and Personnel has been engaging  directly &mdash; as, indeed, has the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment  (DETI) &mdash; with the European Union, along with Treasury officials. Indeed, the  reaction from Europe was positive. At the meeting, it was said that, as long as  the Azores ruling was complied with, they did not think that there would be any  difficulty in relation to the European Union. So we will work on that basis. If  we do achieve a lower rate of corporation tax, as I said, it will be of great  benefit to Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I look to places such as Estonia, which has a corporation  tax rate of 10%. Indeed, my Department carried out a significant piece of work  on smaller regions throughout Europe with tax incentives, looking also at their  economic policies. Estonia has a corporation tax rate of 10%, but,  fundamentally, it also has other very good policies, including research and  development, innovation and a whole culture of moving its economy forward, to  bring about economic growth. Let me be very clear: although a low rate of  corporation tax would be a great help to the Northern Ireland economy, we still  need to increase our skills level and have that innovation and research and  development culture very much at the heart of our economy.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  agree with the Minister when she says that the ability to reduce the  corporation tax rate in Northern Ireland could be a significant economic lever  for the Executive and that, hopefully, it will transform the Northern Ireland  economy and help to grow the private sector. However, she is also right when  she says that it will not, on its own, be a silver bullet to transform our  economy. Will she outline what other measures or policies the Executive can  pursue to ensure that we grow our private sector and continue to attract foreign  investment?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  I thank the Member for that question. As I have said, we need to continue to  grow our skills agenda. In that regard, I look forward to a meeting that will  take place in the near future with the Minister for Employment and Learning to  see what else we can do in and around the skills agenda. As economy Minister, I  pushed for the Treasury paper, in addition to containing the corporation tax  proposals, to look at matters such as research and development tax credits,  which is a key element that could really help the many companies that raised  the matter with me. Another issue that some people mention is whether companies  in Northern Ireland could take a holiday from National Insurance contributions.  There are other elements as well. However, the independent economic advisory  group that gives me advice simply says that, while other things will help, the  thing that will give us the step change will be the lowering of corporation  tax.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  I commend the ability of the Minister to step in at such short notice and  handle the questions in such a comprehensive fashion. I return to an issue that  the Minister addressed earlier. Assuming that the power to vary taxes is  devolved to the Assembly, would it become practically impossible for the  Executive to do so unless and until we resolve the current difference in the  estimates?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  We cannot take a leap into the dark on this matter; we will have to get more  clarity in and around the estimates that were given to us. The Member will know  that the Department of Finance and Personnel carried out considerable work in  relation to the ancillary benefits that will arise as a result of reducing  corporation tax. If you get more people to come in to Northern Ireland, you  are, of course, going to have more people spending money in Northern Ireland  and paying National Insurance contributions and all of the other taxes. He is  right: there is very much a need to get clarity on the estimates from Treasury.  That is not for the want of asking on our part, but we will continue to ask.  Once the consultation is over, that matter will take up speed again.</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Village, Belfast: Negative Equity</p>
        <p class="OralAnswers-Question">7. <strong>Mr A  Maskey </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel for an update on the  discussions that have taken place between his Department and the Department for  Social Development and the Northern Ireland Housing Executive regarding the  negative equity issue that has arisen as a result of homes being vested in the  Village area of south Belfast.&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  111/11-15<a name="AQO111/11-15" id="AQO111/11-15"></a>)</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  Following the Assembly debate on negative equity in October 2010, the Finance  Minister met Ministers Attwood and Murphy in November 2010. In April of this  year, he again met Minister Attwood and was briefed on the outcome of Minister  Attwood&rsquo;s discussions with the Attorney General. Senior officials from the  Department for Social Development and the Department of Finance and Personnel  have met on several occasions to discuss those difficult issues.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  I thank the Minister for that reply. In a previous response, she said that some  businesses may fall outside the benefit of the business rate relief scheme but,  nevertheless, would be able to absorb that because of the size and scale of  their operations. Similarly, in the Village area &mdash; there are obviously others,  but I speak for the purposes of this question &mdash; a number of people who have  bought properties may be landlords, but others may be people who have families  or may be first-time buyers.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Is the Minister in any position to explain whether the Departments  have examined the scale of the negative implications that there may well be for  first-time buyers and families, as opposed to larger landlords, who, I  understand, bought some of the properties? There is a scale of how the negative  impact may apply to individual families. Is any work being done on that?</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  A considerable amount of work has been carried out on that. As I understand it,  there are 538 properties in the Village urban renewal area, and, of those, it  is estimated that in the region of 60 owners are in negative equity. Of those  60, it is understood that four cases relate to owner-occupiers and the rest are  held by landlords.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I know that the issue is causing considerable angst in that  area, and the Finance Minister has kept in close contact with the Department  for Social Development on it. They have looked at a previous Lands Tribunal  case in relation to the matter, but, in this new mandate, they will want to be  up to date on whether any action can be taken. As I understand it, from that  case, there is no legal basis for compensating negative equity. That discussion  was ongoing between the Minister for Social Development, the Minister for  Regional Development and the Minister of Finance and Personnel, and they will  probably want to revisit that.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Time is up, and that concludes Question Time for today. I  ask Members to take their ease for a few moments until the next item of  business.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Motion made:</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">That the Assembly do now adjourn. &mdash; [Mr Deputy Speaker.]</p>
        <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="a6"></a>Adjournment</p>
        <p class="H4StageHeading">A26: Glarryford to Ballycastle</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The proposer of the topic for debate will have 15 minutes. The  Minister for Regional Development will have 10 minutes to respond. All other  Members who wish to speak will have approximately eight minutes.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  thank the Members who have remained for the Adjournment debate, particularly  those from the North Antrim constituency. I also thank the Minister for  Regional Development for his attendance.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The A26 is one of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s main routes. It runs  from County Armagh and County Down right up through the heart of County Antrim  and into Coleraine. The part that runs through my constituency carries a large  volume of traffic daily, and it is a main arterial route for commercial and domestic  vehicles. It serves a population base of well over 100,000 people.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">During the summer months &mdash; that is, on the particular day  that we get a summer &mdash; people head up to Northern Ireland&rsquo;s premier tourist  attractions, one of which, the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway, is in my North Antrim  constituency. They also visit many of the other attractions in the north coast  area. The Northern Ireland Tourist Board estimates that around 1 million people  visit the north coast each year, and many of them use the A26 to get to their  destination. Road usage increases on specific days such as the Auld Lammas  Fair, the Easter holidays, the Twelfth fortnight, the North West 200 and many  other events.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">If the original motorway plans of the 1960s had become a  reality, the traffic would have been carried by the M2, but, as we know, the M2  was never completed, so the A26 carries the burden. The stretch of the A26 that  runs between Ballymena and Ballymoney is dual carriageway from just after you  come off the M2 until you reach the Glarryford junction, where it becomes a  single-lane road, with just a few bits and pieces of dual carriageway. I use  the road almost every day of the week, and anyone who uses the road will know  that it becomes very frustrating to be stuck behind a slow-moving vehicle after  having made steady progress on the M2 and the dual carriageway. There is always  the temptation to overtake, and it might not always be wise to do so.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It has, therefore, been argued for a long time, rightly,  that the rest of the road from Glarryford up to Ballymoney needs to be upgraded  to dual carriageway. However, in particular, the section that needs urgent  action &mdash; this is the subject of the debate today &mdash; is the section that runs  from the Glarryford junction to the Drones Road and the junction to the right  that takes you off to the A44 to Ballycastle. It is 7 km in length or, for  those of us who still are more attuned to miles, it is nearly four and a half  miles.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">That section of the A26 takes in the famous Frosses trees,  and the road through the bogland is known for the supporting trees but also,  tragically, for its fatal accidents. Indeed, it has been described as one of  Northern Ireland&rsquo;s most dangerous roads. More than 20 people have lost their  lives there over the past two decades. I have obtained figures from the police  for accidents in the past 10 years at those stretches of the road up to March  this year. They show that, in that time, there have been 47 serious collisions,  resulting in nine people losing their lives and 33 being seriously injured.  Those figures are for collisions on the main road only and do not include  collisions on or near the junctions themselves.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">It would remiss of the House not to, at this stage,  remember those families who have lost loved ones and friends as a result of accidents  on that road, and our thoughts and prayers are with those families. Road  statistics are just that &mdash; statistics. However, behind every news report of a  fatal accident, there is a very tangible human tragedy, and families affected  can never really move on. So, my thoughts today are very much with those  families for whom the A26 holds dark and painful memories. I fully accept that  not all the accidents that occurred there were due to the road being a single  rather than a dual carriageway, but I feel that we owe it to those who have  lost their lives to do all that we can to reduce the risk and increase road  safety.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the fact that Roads Service has this week started  work on a right-turning lane at the A26 at the junction of Frosses Road and  Crosstagherty Road. I raised that issue with Roads Service some time ago, and I  am delighted that it was able to find ways whereby that work was able to  commence at the beginning of this week.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">For far too long, there have been decisions, proposals and  plans to upgrade the section of the road from Glarryford to the Drones Road. It  has been on the cards for years, and all that there have been are talks,  discussions, proposals and promises but, to date, no delivery. As far as I can  see, the problems on that stretch of road were discussed as far back as 1990 &mdash;  21 years ago &mdash; when a concerted effort was made by Ballymena and Ballymoney  councils to conduct research and put some pressure on the direct rule  Ministers. Indeed, the arrival of new direct rule Ministers, both Conservative  and Labour, usually signalled visits to the road, with the accompanying  promises.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">However, in August 2008, it seemed as though we were on  track with the announcement by the then Minister for Regional Development of  the preferred route for a new dual carriageway at an estimated cost of &pound;52  million. As is often the case when a new road is proposed, there was  considerable concern about the loss of valuable farming land and about houses,  and so on. However, the 2008 scheme attempted to minimise all that, as most of  the existing road was to be used. There is, of course, considerable concern at  the moment, and, at this stage, I say to the Minister that, although work has  been carried out, plans have been laid and negotiations have taken place with landowners,  there are particular problems in that the design does not secure an appropriate  and adequate underpass for some landowners. The road cuts through some good  farmland, and, in fact, some farms are now divided. I have seen some of the  proposals, and I do not think that they go far enough to address the specific  issues that have been raised with me about the adequate provision of underpass.  Therefore, it would be useful if the Minister were to bear in mind that issue  when he considers the project.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">At the time when the announcement was made, I and my DUP  Assembly colleagues warmly welcomed the proposed upgrade of that vital economic  and trading corridor. At the time, we said that, for more than 20 years,  fatalities along the route had increased and the decision, while of little  comfort to those who have been bereaved or injured, at last indicated that road  safety is a priority. We hoped that deaths on that road would be a thing of the  past when the new carriageway was built. However, almost three years later,  little work has been carried out apart from statutory processes. In fact, no  work has started on the ground.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The previous Minister stated that his Department was  continuing to develop the design. I understand that such things take time.  However, the longer it goes on, the longer we face the sort of problems that I  have outlined and the more costs we will, ultimately, incur. That has been  confirmed by the current Minister in his response to a written question that I  tabled a few days ago, in which he stated:</p>
        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Unfortunately, the funding levels within the current  budget do not allow for construction to start before 2014/15 at the earliest.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I am afraid that I find little comfort in those words.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I am aware that the Minister is taking a look at the proposed  investment in roads throughout Northern Ireland and how Budget 2010 might  impact on all of that. Although there is little doubt that the A5 and A6 are  also regarded as important enhancements to the road network, I know that there  is considerable unease about the A5 in particular and that it is currently the  subject of a public inquiry. It is a controversial plan. I note that the  Minister is on record as having said that he will not be stampeded into a  decision. Far be it for me to try to blow the whistle for that stampede to  commence; however, if there is any chance of a plan for the A5, I urge the  Minister to do what he can as part of the monitoring rounds to persuade his  Executive colleagues of the merits of redirecting spare finances to the A26  project.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">An upgrade will not solve all the problems. However, it  will help tourism, businesses and the many commuters who use that route daily.  Most importantly, it will reduce the risk of accidents. Sadly, it will not  eradicate them. While there is human error, there will always be accidents.  Surely, if an upgrade helps to make the road safer, it is well worth the  investment. If it saves one life, it is well worth that investment.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I do not envy the Minister his task of responding to the  debate. My colleagues, my party and I appreciate fully the difficult and almost  impossible decisions that he faces. However, I ask him to take a long hard look  at what has been said, the history of the project, and all the concerns that  have been raised. I carried out a search on the matter in the council. I was  able to unearth a considerable paper trail on the project that goes back many  years to various Ministers and the Department. It was interesting that almost  all of the responses, which came from as far back as when Mr Moss MP was  Minister, focused on the economics of the project. Surely, if the focus had  been kept on the issue, the project would have been delivered many years ago at  considerably less cost to the public purse than is now estimated.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I am delighted that the Minister is here. I appreciate the  time that he has taken in conversations and written responses to deal with the  issue. Again, I ask him seriously to consider that plight and resolve the  ongoing problem of the A26. I trust that there will soon be speedy progress on  the delivery of a much-needed upgrade on that stretch of road.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: As this is the first debate in which the Assembly will hear from  Robin Swann, I remind the House of the convention that a maiden speech should  be made uninterrupted.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Swann</strong>:  There are not many in the House to interrupt me. It is with great humility that  I rise to make my maiden speech to the House. I am also greatly humbled by the  number of Members who have seen fit to make it into the House to hear it, and I  hope that the prospect of my speaking has not deterred them from participating  in what is a significant debate on the A26 in north Antrim. I will return to  that matter shortly.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the electorate of  North Antrim who returned me to the House as an Ulster Unionist. I assure them  that North Antrim has a strong, proud and determined Ulster Unionist heritage  that I will endeavour to carry on. For a long time, the House reverberated from  the noise made by the so-called big man from North Antrim. I inform you, Mr  Deputy Speaker, that there is now a wee man from North Antrim in this place,  and it will be my intention to make sure that I am heard. I intend to leave my  mark. It may not be a photograph hanging on the stairs or a life-size bronze  statue, although one of me would use a lot less bronze than one of Craigavon.  Rather, I will endeavour to leave my mark through my work for the people not  only of north Antrim but of Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I take this opportunity to pay tribute to my predecessor,  the Reverend Dr Robert Coulter MBE, who served the House faithfully in many  roles and served the Ulster Unionist Party steadfastly over many years. I only  hope and pray that I can build on the firm foundations that he delivered into  my hands.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I consider it a great privilege to represent the great  constituency of North Antrim from Kells to the Causeway, which, I hope, the A26  will cover one day. North Antrim born and bred, the son of a plumber and a  hospital cleaner, and from a farming background, I know what hard work is. I am  fully aware of the hardships facing families across the whole constituency, and  I dedicate myself to working for them. Having been labelled often as a  Ballymena man and tagged with the various stereotypes that come with that, I  will work in this place to bring to task those individuals who seem now to know  only the cost of everything but the value of nothing. At this stage, I can only  stress the strength of the values of that strong north Antrim work ethic that  my parents instilled in me and the importance of strong family values, which I  thank my wife and young daughter for giving me. By embracing those values in  the House, we can all work to make this a better place to live.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The North Antrim constituency to which Mr Storey referred  is a marvellous place. It has the eighth wonder of the world, the Giant&rsquo;s  Causeway, and we are much indebted to Finn McCool for his foresight in placing  such a fabulous tourist attraction in the most beautiful constituency in  Northern Ireland, if not the world. We are also blessed with the green slopes  of Slemish, where St Patrick spent time in contemplation, and our famous green  glens. We have so much to offer, and it is right that we should be proud of the  area.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I will return to the topic of today&rsquo;s debate. So much more  could be done by continuing the upgrade of the A26 from Glarryford to  Ballycastle, a route that would help the people of the area. Upwards of 20,000  vehicles a day use the current road, which is in stark contrast to the usage of  other upgrades brought before the House. Mr Storey has given a detailed  description of almost every turn along that road.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">On a constituency level, I express my disappointment that  the upgrade of the A26 was not given the same special status in the previous  mandate as that of the A5 and the A8 and in the failure of the previous Sinn  F&eacute;in Minister in not affording the people of North Antrim the same  consideration. Mr Storey rightly referred to the families who lost loved ones  because of the dangers on that road.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I seek an assurance from the Minister that the A26 upgrade  will be brought forward if and when additional or other funds become available  and that he will include that in the next evolution of the investment strategy  for Northern Ireland. I take this opportunity to inform the people of north  Antrim that I have raised the matter of continued work on the A26 with the  Minister on a daily basis, which I am sure that he will attest to, and not just  by presenting questions for written answer to the House. I have extended an  invitation to the Minister to view the proposed route and the famous trees at  the Frosses, to take the opportunity to talk with a few of the farmers whose  land will be affected by the future work, and to discuss the options for  adequate access to their land that lies on either side of the new route.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Using the protection of my maiden speech, I also invite the  Minister, when he is in north Antrim, to see how a link road around the village  of Cullybackey would help the residents as well as the future development of  traffic-calming measures across the villages and hamlets in north Antrim, of  which Kells, Connor and Dervock are a few on a long list that I will raise with  him day and daily.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As I said earlier, I will use my time in the House to raise  the concerns of and defend the small man. I am sure that my friend and  colleague Mr Ross Hussey, if he were in this place, would agree that, in  addressing the problems that we face in our daily business, a one-size solution  will not fit all in this House. I pledge to the Speaker&rsquo;s Office that, when I  rise to my feet, I will use the time that I have been allotted to say what I  have to say and will not simply speak for the length of time that is available.  Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you for your indulgence in my maiden speech.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  I begin by congratulating Mr Swann on his maiden speech. We look forward to his  raising continually the issues that, of course, affect all of us who live in  and represent North Antrim.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">One of the cardinal issues that have afflicted the  constituency is the state of the A26, which has been a constant bugbear for  residents and visitors. We have seen false dawns and expectations rise only to  be dashed. At this moment, we still live with the reality of an utterly  inadequate road. Yet, it is one of the main arteries in our Province, has one  of the highest daily vehicle usage figures, and, as Mr Storey said, has a  tragic death rate. A number of us in the House know and think today of people  who have lost their lives on that road. So, it is not just some abstract thing  that we are talking about. It is a pressing, urgent necessity that we address  the inadequacy of road provision.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Indeed, it is probably a reflection of the significance of  roads issues and the inadequacy of some roads that we have probably debated the  issue of roads more than anything else in the House since the start of this  mandate. That in itself points to underinvestment, which is a legacy of the  last Executive, and that legacy now falls to the current Minister to address.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The issue is not just about convenience and about getting  to the north coast faster. It is, in effect, about developing the economy of  north Antrim, because there is an inextricable link between good road access  and economic development. It is no coincidence that Ballymena, to which we have  good road links, has seen industrial growth. Yet, if you drive the further  miles to Ballymoney, you will see a dearth and a loss of industrial growth.  That is not a coincidence. Ready access is a big contributory factor to the  economic attractiveness and viability of any town.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">However, when you impose on a town such as Ballymoney the  restraints and inhibitions that arise from that dreadful stretch of road from  Glarryford to the town, do not be surprised that it is hard to attract  necessary investment.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  see the point that the Member is making; it is a change from what he said  during the election, when he accused the Investment Minister over the problems  in Ballymoney. Having roads there is important, but how would Tyco, Sherwood&rsquo;s,  Ballymoney Foods or the Fleming&rsquo;s factory have benefited from the road&rsquo;s being  a dual carriageway? Is it not also the case that commercial decisions were made  &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member speak through the Chair, please?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Unfortunately, those decisions affect Ballymoney and should be included in his  comments.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  Of course commercial decisions are relevant, but commercial decisions to expand  are aided if there is a good roads network. Therefore, I am surprised that the  Member intervenes to argue against himself and the cause of improving the A26.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Let me pick up on his point. He made reference to comments  made during the election. Yes, there is a definite nexus between economic  development and a good roads structure. The Minister himself represents an area  that has shown the benefits of that. We have had a huge economic focus on the  Belfast to Dublin corridor. The natural consequence of that, and this is where  the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI) Minister played her  part, is that we have seen a disproportionate pouring of investment into  industrial parks and other ventures in proximity to those roads. Before the  election, the DUP Minister poured yet another &pound;38 million into the industrial  park in Newry, but not a penny for Ballymoney. That is the point that I was  making.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I appeal to the Minister, being a beneficiary of a good  roads structure in the southern part of the Province, to take pity on his poor  northern cousins. He can move himself to spread to the northern part of the  Province the largesse that has given the southern part of the Province a good  roads infrastructure.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The scheme is, essentially, ready to go, but it has  stalled. The stalling of the scheme is not just a frustration; it blights those  whose lands are affected. Farmers were co-operative in the process and not  obstructive as some have been elsewhere. We arrived at a scheme that is viable  and tolerable for all concerned. However, an inevitable consequence is that their  land is now blighted by that planned expansion.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">In the name of the farmers, I say to the Minister that time  is not on our side; we need to move on this issue. In the scale of things, &pound;50  million is not a huge amount of money; in the scale of the extravagance of the  A5, it is but nothing. It will not break the bank of the Department for  Regional Development (DRD), but it will do a great deal for the future of that  very important part of Northern Ireland that is north Antrim. I urge upon you  the necessity of giving it all the priority that it most certainly deserves. As  I said, at present we have the worst of all worlds: a promise unfulfilled, a  blight on the landowners and yet no product. We need product on this matter.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Storey&rsquo;s intervention provokes me to welcome the fact  that he has returned to supporting the A26 project. A few months ago, he and Mr  Frew, who, I hope, now supports the project again, voted for a Budget in the  knowledge that that Budget under that Minister would scrap the A26. By his vote  in this House in support of that Budget &mdash; I am glad that the Minister cannot be  accused of this &mdash; he was prepared to downgrade the project and see the  scrapping of the A26. It is to be welcomed that Mr Storey and, I trust, Mr  Frew, have returned to full support for the A26. Together we might see it  delivered.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Frew</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  Yes.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Time is up; we must move on.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">A number of Members have lately indicated that they wish to  speak, so we will have to restrict the remaining three Members who wish to  speak to six minutes.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McMullan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I will not keep you six minutes.  The section of the A26 Frosses Road between Glarryford and the A44 Drones Road  forms part of the northern key transport corridor. We have listened to  arguments between some Members today about what happened before and after the  election, but that does not solve the problem for the people who are looking  for these road improvements to be made.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I want to quickly talk about the economic benefits of the  road. The road goes from Belfast right into Derry, and from Derry it takes you  right into Donegal, opening up an all-Ireland corridor for tourism, for  commercial life and for all. It is one of the busiest roads for the haulage  industry, which is vital to our economy. Indeed, transport business comes from  the South of Ireland into the North, going to Belfast or Larne and, ultimately,  to England, Scotland or Wales.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The road is absolutely vital for the tourism industry. It  takes you right down into where the previous Member alluded to &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Swann</strong>: I  thank the Member for giving way. We must stress that the A26 should not be made  into a link road that goes straight from Ballymena to Ballycastle to the  detriment of the small villages that lie along the proposed route. Some signage  should be put in place to ensure that they get their proper dues, rather than  having a straight rat run.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McMullan</strong>:  I thank the Member for his intervention. I will come to some of the smaller  villages later, but I agree that all villages, big and small, are entitled to  their share of the tourism trade, and we see that at the minute. However, the  Frosses Road meets the Drones Road to take you into Ballycastle, and, only  recently, a new operator has come in to run a ferry from Ballycastle to  Campbeltown. That will also be a vital link for our tourism industry.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that the Minister will look at putting some money  into the Antrim coast road. We could do with it. We have the Lammas fair and  the North West 200, and there is Portrush. Those are all vital tourist links,  and we cannot let them go away. I totally agree with the Member when he talked  about the number of fatalities and injuries on that road. I will go so far as  to say that it is one of the worst roads on the network for fatalities. I agree  with the Member that we are thinking of the families at this time when we are  putting up the case for commercial business.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I will not dwell much longer on what I have to say. I  support the debate and thank the Member for bringing it to the House. We have  to agree collectively and not talk about what Members did or did not do, as  some Members are trying to make out. The scheme and the route have been  identified, so let us get on with it and see if we can put money into  developing it. We have to open up that whole area for tourism.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Member mentioned small villages. The new  state-of-the-art visitors&rsquo; centre at the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway will be ready next  year, and it is hoped that it will encourage somewhere in the region of 700,000  people a year to visit. Those are phenomenal figures in anybody&rsquo;s book. We must  have the infrastructure to take those people in and out, and people must feel  confident that they will be able to drive in and out without sitting in tailbacks  and traffic jams.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The Antrim coast road is a vital link to Larne. I was a  North Antrim man for years until legislation changed me into an East Antrim  man, but I still have my ties in North Antrim, and I empathise with everything  that has been said. However, we should not lose sight of the port of Larne  being a vital corridor for industry coming here. The amount of traffic that  goes through it &mdash; road haulage, tourism and everything else &mdash; filters out right  down through the coast. Picture that network going through the whole place. So,  Minister, I ask you to think about this seriously, and I support everything  that has been brought to the debate. Before I finish, I congratulate the Member  on making his maiden speech.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D McIlveen</strong>:  I congratulate Robin on his maiden speech, and I thank my friend and colleague  Mervyn for securing the debate.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Obviously, this stretch of road has been in the news for  all the wrong reasons. I agree with the previous Member to speak that talk is  cheap and we need to see something done as quickly as possible. I listened,  quite interested, to the debate on the A5, and a lot of the arguments  surrounded the economic advantages and convenience of opening up that route.  That is not really what this debate is about. Safety is the elephant in the  room when it comes to the A26. It is a very dangerous piece of road. As Mervyn  said, more than 20 people have died on the road, and there have been 47 serious  collisions. For the sum of around &pound;50 million, which does not sound too bad  when you say it quickly, that could be easily eradicated. The problem will be  much eased by widening that stretch of road.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I am conscious that I am doubling up a little, but I want  to imprint this fact. I ask the Minister to work with farmers in the area when  the road comes to be looked at. I will go further and ask the Minister to  perhaps give some guarantees that funding will be available for suitably sized  underpasses, so that farmers can adequately access their land.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As well as the safety issue, there is the economic one. If  we are to encourage tourism into Northern Ireland, we need to make sure that  our infrastructure is up to the job. This part of north Antrim, up to the north  coast, is one of the jewels in the crown of Northern Ireland tourism. People  regularly come from all over the world to the north, some specifically to go to  the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway. Bear in mind that this road is some people&rsquo;s first  impression of Northern Ireland. So, coming from Belfast, they have the M2  leading onto the dual carriageway of the A26. They are heading up to the  Giant&rsquo;s Causeway when, all of a sudden, they get to the junction at Glarryford,  and they move at a snail&rsquo;s pace. Even worse, they may come across a road  accident. I ask the Minister whether we want this to be the first impression of  Northern Ireland for tourists. I support the debate wholeheartedly, and I  encourage the Minister to make the A26 upgrade a reality as quickly as  possible.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Frew</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity to take part in the debate. I  believe that there was some confusion with regard to who was down to speak. I  apologise for not hearing the whole debate. I was chairing the Agriculture  Committee, and I am glad that the debate was still going on when I came out of  that meeting. This is a very important issue not only for north Antrim but for  Northern Ireland as a whole. I congratulate my DUP colleague Mervyn Storey on  securing the Adjournment debate. I also congratulate Robin Swann on his maiden  speech, for which he certainly picked a good subject. For many years, we in the  DUP have campaigned for improvements on every stretch of this carriageway. It  is not something that we shirk or shy away from. We raise the issue at every  opportunity that we can.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I will be brief on this, because I want to spend my time  having the ear of the Minister, but I will address Jim Allister&rsquo;s comments  about Mervyn Storey and me not supporting this. At no time have we ever not  supported the upgrade of that road. Equating that with supporting the Budget is  just farcical. It is easy when you are a one-member party to stand up, gowl,  snarl your teeth and everything else.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. The Member voted for the Budget in  circumstances in which the Minister for Regional Development had made it plain  that, on his assignment of money, he would prioritise the A5 and shelve other  schemes, including the A26 scheme. Therefore, the Member, with his eyes and  ears wide open, voted for that proposition when he voted for the Budget. He  might like to deny it now, but that is the unpalatable truth.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Frew</strong>: I  thank the Member for his comments. Let me explain to him and perhaps educate  him. Had we not voted for the Budget, Northern Ireland would be bankrupt today.  Let us be clear: it is easy to nit-pick and make such suggestions, but the  Member does not really know the full &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member please return to the subject?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Frew</strong>: I  will, Mr Deputy Speaker. I do not want to waste any more time on negative  comments. We now have the ear of the Minister, and I appreciate his taking the  time to attend this Adjournment debate.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I want to talk about tourism. North Antrim is split in two,  straight down the middle. The spine of north Antrim is the A26. It opens up the  north coast and the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway. It has some great funding opportunities  and some great tourism aspects. We have the North West 200. The A26 opens up  the north side of County Londonderry, including Coleraine and Limavady, and  people can travel along it the whole way to the city of Londonderry. It is a  major road, an arterial route of our Province. It attracts lots of traffic and  businesses. It can provide Northern Ireland with growth. If the road is  improved, it will help haulage contractors and businesspeople commute from Londonderry  to Belfast and vice versa. It will help towns in between those places and help  everywhere in County Antrim. I ask the Minister to think carefully about the  road and what it means to Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I concur with what my colleagues said about the farming  community and the provision of underpasses. It is crucial that the farming  community is thought of. We have been campaigning for many years, not only for  tourism, business and economic development but for safety. It is clear that  there is a major safety issue on the A26. Many of the accidents that occur on  it at present are rear-end shunts. That says a lot about the road and about the  improvements that have been made in other years and on other stretches of the  road. It is fine time that we in north Antrim had a good road network to link  the towns of Ballymena and Ballymoney. It would improve investment and business  in those towns and in every village in between. It would provide access to  other villages by virtue of the bare fact that people would be able to travel  to those communities much more quickly and safely. It would certainly open them  up.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I think that I have overrun, so I thank you for your  patience, Mr Deputy Speaker. I ask the Minister to think seriously about the  road and the improvements that can be made to it. I plead with all North Antrim  Members and anyone who has an interest, including Members who represent East  Antrim, that we might come together and present a united front to ensure that  the A26 gets the improvements it so badly needs.</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy (The  Minister for Regional Development)</strong>: I am grateful for the opportunity to  respond to the debate. I thank all the Members who spoke for their  contributions. I have listened intently and with interest. I congratulate in  particular my party colleague Mr Swann, who made his maiden speech. It was a  very good contribution and one that deserved a wider audience. I congratulate  him and welcome him to the Assembly.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I have asked my officials to take note of the Hansard  report so that, if I do not pick up on any points or have not time to respond,  I can write to Members directly after the debate.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">At the outset, I restate that I welcome and support  improvements to the A26 and other arterial routes across Northern Ireland. As  Minister for Regional Development, I want to see improvements across the road  network that will help enhance safety, reduce journey times, provide value for  money and support the economy. I note the comments made by Members, which align  with the support my Department has received for the scheme from local  representatives over the years. I welcome the opportunity to participate in the  debate on the proposed improvement works on the A26 Frosses Road between  Glarryford and the Ballycastle junction of the A44 Drones Road.</p>
        <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The A26 Frosses Road forms part of the northern transport  corridor as an element of the strategic road network between Belfast and the  north coast. It provides an important commuter and tourism link. The route  between Belfast and Glarryford is constructed to either motorway or dual  carriageway standard. However, from Glarryford, the A26 Frosses Road reduces to  a single carriageway. A 7-km or, if you are imperially trained like Mr Storey  and me, a four and a half-mile stretch of the Frosses Road from Glarryford to  the A44 Drones Road carries in excess of 20,000 vehicles a day and suffers from  congestion at peak traffic times in particular. In addition, there is a lack of  opportunity for safe overtaking. I also recognise and acknowledge the high  number of accidents, some unfortunately fatal, and I offer my sympathy to the  families who will never recover from the loss of a loved one in such tragic  circumstances.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The scheme is included in the regional strategic transport  network transport plan, which was published in March 2005. That identified this  section of the A26 as needing improvement to achieve dual carriageway standard.  That supports the aims of the regional transportation strategy, which is  reflected in my Department&rsquo;s vision to provide dual carriageway standard roads  on all key transport corridors. In response, Roads Service is continuing to  develop proposals for a new dual carriageway on the A26 between Glarryford and  the A44 Drones Road. The scheme includes the provision of 7 km of dual  carriageway with a 70 mph design speed between Glarryford and Drones Road. A  detailed assessment against the national criteria produced a preferred route  that closely follows the line of the existing road. The scheme also provides  junction improvements along the stretch, which include grade-separated  interchanges at the B64 Glarryford junction, the C61 Lisnasoo Road and the B94  Drumadoon Road. A new roundabout will be provided at the A44 Drones Road at the  end of the scheme.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I will tell Members about the progress to date. The design  of the scheme has been under way since 2006, when consultants were appointed to  develop and progress a preferred scheme through the statutory procedures.  Throughout the scheme development, my Department has sought to ensure that  those directly affected, the general public and elected representatives have  been kept fully informed of progress.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">A number of Members mentioned the impact on farmland.  Again, I can confirm that the Department appointed an agricultural consultant  to assess the scale of the impact on farms affected by the dualling scheme.  Roads Service is and will remain committed to working with farmers to ensure  that access to land is maintained and the impact is mitigated through  accommodation works where possible.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">The preferred route for the scheme was announced in August  2008. Since then, work has continued on scheme development, and my Department  is working towards the publication of the draft Orders and an environmental  statement for the project later this year. I hope that signals intent and  willing on my behalf and that of my Department to progress this important  scheme.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">My Department&rsquo;s budget allocation &mdash;</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I really must make progress, but I listened to the Member&rsquo;s contribution.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">A reduction of two fifths in the Executive&rsquo;s overall  capital funding brings with it a significant challenge to us all. That is  especially true for my Department&rsquo;s infrastructure investment. Of the &pound;1&middot;2  billion allocated to Roads Service for capital spend over the four-year Budget  2010 period, almost two thirds or nearly &pound;800 million is allocated to two major  roads schemes, namely the A5 and the A8. Of the remaining capital funding in  the four-year period, limited funding is available for other schemes, particularly  in the middle two years. That makes it extremely difficult to start any scheme  until near the end of the Budget period. Following the draft Budget  consultation, over &pound;60 million of additional funding was received for major  road projects in year 4 of the Budget period. That will be considered for a  range of competing priorities.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">Decisions to start schemes in 2014-15 will be dependent on  the funding made available beyond the current Budget period. Schemes such as  the A26 will take more than one year of construction, and funding cover in year  5 and possibly beyond that would be required before I could give approval for  construction to commence. The funding in those years will not become clearer  until further work has been completed to develop the third edition of the  investment strategy for Northern Ireland, which was referred to by Members and  is due to conclude this year.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As Members will be aware, I have received numerous requests  to meet a wide range of bodies and elected members who are interested in progressing  strategic road improvement schemes across Northern Ireland. I will continue to  use those as opportunities to listen to opinions from across the Province  before forming a view on the way forward. That will coincide with the work  being undertaken to develop the investment strategy beyond this Budget period.  I appreciate the safety, business and tourism arguments made by Members for why  the proposals to improve the A26 should be advanced to construction. Mr Swann  is right: on a continuing basis &mdash; almost daily and certainly any time he sees  me &mdash; his first words are &ldquo;A26&rdquo;. I have to live with that reality.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased to reaffirm the intention to publish draft  Orders and an environmental statement for a proposed scheme later this year.  That will lead to a statutory consultation period and, on the basis of the  number and type of comments received, I will make a decision on whether a  public inquiry is required.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">As Minister, I want to see improvements across the  strategic road network that will enhance safety, as I said, reduce journey  times and provide value for money. I intend to consider the proposed investment  across my Department and the impact of Budget 2010 on the roads programme, and  I want to explore opportunities for bringing forward schemes such as the A26  dualling scheme between Glarryford and the Ballycastle junction.</p>
        <p class="B3BodyText">I will quickly respond to Members. Mr Storey set out the  case very well. He gave us the history and reminded me of my words in another  debate, when I would not be stampeded. Members will understand that I have to  give careful consideration to the large number of representations on schemes,  bypasses and improvements, unlike Mr Swann, who seems to want me to spend all  of my budget allocation, if not on the A26 then on a bypass for Cullybackey and  other places.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I take the point that people want to see road improvements  across the entire Province. I thank Members for all of their input. I have  listened carefully. If I have missed points, I will attempt to address them by  writing to the Member concerned. It has been a valuable experience for me to  learn so much about the A26.</p>
