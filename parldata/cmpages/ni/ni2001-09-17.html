                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That this Assembly agrees the regional
                development strategy (‘Shaping our Future’) for Northern
                Ireland 2025.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 2 July we were able to debate progress on
                the formulation of the regional development strategy. That
                debate was very positive. I valued greatly the contributions
                from individual Members and was very heartened by the broad
                support received from the Assembly. Following the debate I wrote
                to several Members in response to points that I was unable,
                because of lack of time, to deal with when winding up.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since then I have made several changes to the
                text. In the main, these changes tidy up the text and, I hope,
                in the light of comments made during the debate, make a number
                of sections of the document clearer. Details of those changes
                have been incorporated in the final text of the strategy, copies
                of which have been made available to Members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I wish to inform the House that in
                response to an approach made by the Regional Development
                Committee on Wednesday past I propose to make a further
                amendment to the change that I was proposing to the text on page
                73. The last sentence of the second bullet point will now read:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;While the balance of the housing need
                shall be provided from ‘greenfield’ sites, as much new
                housing as practicably possible, (as assessed following receipt
                of the Urban Capacity Study), will be provided within the built
                up area <b><i>to seek to achieve</i></b> the regional ‘brownfield’
                target <b><i>of 60%</i></b> but without town cramming.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I believe that this further change will
                reassure the Committee and the Assembly of my earnest commitment
                to the urban housing drive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I stress again that the key principles set
                out in the text that was debated on 2 July remain unchanged.
                Those principles must underpin, indeed validate, the strategy,
                and it is worth repeating them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The strategy is about establishing an
                important strategic planning framework for the next 25 years,
                which is much more than planning effectively our public
                infrastructure over the next 25 years, important as that is. It
                is about creating the conditions for a long-term competitive and
                sustainable economic and physical development of the region.
                Sustainable development concerns all of us. Whether we are in
                the public or private sector, we need to take account of it in
                our strategic planning. The strategy is about environmental,
                economic and social sustainability.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the last debate I made the point —
                and this is an important view that is shared by many in the
                Chamber — that the strategy is critically about building
                sustainable communities. Social and economic cohesion is at its
                heart. That need has been all too visibly underscored by the
                terrible scenes in north Belfast over the past few weeks.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The strategy emphasises the need for balanced
                development. Every part of Northern Ireland, whether a rural or
                an urban area, should be able to contribute to a strong and
                prosperous Northern Ireland, and the regional development
                strategy is about urban and rural, not urban versus the rest.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also about achieving a balanced
                approach. We need to energise the contribution of different
                areas and ensure development in the north, south, east and west
                of the Province. It is also important to support the
                complementary roles of urban and rural areas — and do so in a
                way that promotes the overall development of the region.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The implementation phase of the strategy is
                important. For implementation to be successful, there must be a
                credible delivery mechanism that has the active support of key
                stakeholders. Achieving that requires Departments, agencies,
                councils, business, the voluntary and community sectors and
                individuals to work together to benefit the region as a whole.
                However, organisations do not take action, people do, and people
                implement what they are involved in creating.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many people have already been involved in
                getting us to the point where, by leave of the Assembly, the
                strategy is agreed. That is a major plus. Over the next few
                months, I will put in place innovative and responsive
                arrangements at sub-regional level to assist Departments to
                deliver the strategy and ensure that progress is made across
                Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The form of those sub-regional arrangements
                needs to be discussed. However, the city visioning processes
                under way in Belfast, Londonderry, Craigavon and Armagh, the
                work of several district councils that have formed strategic
                clusters, such as the rural west, and the development of local
                strategy partnerships under Peace II provide valuable new
                opportunities for focusing on the needs of specific places. To
                ensure that progress is managed in a co-ordinated and effective
                manner, I will establish and chair an interdepartmental steering
                group.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Monitoring and evaluation are critical for
                measuring the progress of the regional development strategy. In
                the autumn I will advance details of the monitoring and
                evaluation framework to the Committee for Regional Development
                for its consideration. I want to work closely with the Committee
                on shaping that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to ensure that the strategy remains
                appropriate over time, and we need to record and measure change
                across the community. That is particularly important in the
                context of the planning process. Therefore the strategy needs to
                be sufficiently flexible to enable it, area development plans
                and the development control process to respond appropriately to
                emerging trends and opportunities. That need to remain flexible,
                yet still provide a tension between the various elements, is the
                reason why I will soon be advancing proposals for a relatively
                short strategic planning Bill, which will make a minor, largely
                technical, change to the Strategic Planning (Northern Ireland)
                Order 1999.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another important component of the strategy
                will be the development of key regional planning policy
                statements. The first of these will cover housing, retailing,
                transportation and the countryside. These overarching regional
                policy statements are designed to augment and guide a
                comprehensive set of operational planning policy statements
                being prepared by the Department of the Environment, which
                inform the preparation of development plans and decisions on
                development control. This programme of work on both the regional
                and operational policy statements is already well under way and
                will be developed by my Department and the Department of the
                Environment, working in close co-operation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In looking at implementation, the spotlight
                will inevitably fall on housing and the progress towards the
                regional brownfield target of 60% by 2010. Let us not
                underestimate it: the target is challenging, particularly when
                one considers our baseline performance during the 1990s.
                However, the approach set out in the strategy is a more
                sustainable way of meeting our regional housing needs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we are to achieve that target, there is an
                onus on my Department and the other key Departments to engage
                positively with the developers and the builders. My Department
                is prepared to work with the industry — in whatever forum is
                most appropriate for it — to see how we might together meet
                the regional brownfield target.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another area that will rightly come under the
                spotlight is the regional transportation strategy, since it is
                so fundamental to the success of the regional development
                strategy. On 28 September there is to be a major conference on
                the transportation strategy. It will bring together over 300
                people to help us advance our thinking on how we might deliver a
                modern, sustainable, safe transportation system that will
                benefit society and the environment and will actively contribute
                to social inclusion and everyone’s quality of life.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to make a few final remarks. The
                regional development strategy is not a static single-dimensional
                framework. It is multidimensional. It must also be dynamic.
                Beneath the framework there will be a convergence — and I hope
                just a few divergences — of separate and often linked policies
                that will have an impact on future development. The trick will
                be to bring greater coherence to those policies. Also, we need
                to animate the strategy, by which I mean that we should
                stimulate debate around emerging policy issues that might have
                an impact on our drive towards a more sustainable Northern
                Ireland.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In implementing the strategy we should aim
                for constancy of purpose and for success. I ask the Assembly to
                agree the regional development strategy.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for Regional
                Development (Mr A Maginness):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This important document will shape and form
                the development of this region over the next 25 years, and no
                one should underestimate its importance. We should congratulate
                the Minister and his officials on producing such a good
                document. As the Minister has pointed out, it is a framework; it
                is not something that is set in stone. It will be developed over
                the years. Nonetheless, this document represents a very
                important start to the future development of our region.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for the way in which he
                and his officials have worked to shape the document in
                consultation with the Regional Development Committee. On
                numerous occasions, and at short notice, he and his colleagues
                went out of their way to listen to the Committee’s concerns.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Minister has said, the regional
                development strategy is about establishing an important
                strategic planning framework for Northern Ireland over the next
                25 years. I commend him and his Department for the extensive
                consultation that has taken place, and I hope that that spirit
                of consultation will continue. As the Committee’s Deputy
                Chairperson, Mr McFarland, said during the debate on 2 July:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The support of a panel of international
                experts, the public examination and the appointment of an
                independent panel has ensured a rigorous examination that has
                taken into account a wide spectrum of views, right across
                Northern Ireland.&quot; <i>[Official Report, Bound Volume 11,
                p335]</i>.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is now vital that the strategy be
                implemented successfully.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s appreciation that
                the strategy is critical to building sustainable communities. As
                MLA for North Belfast, I agree with him that the recent sad
                events in my constituency highlight the urgency of starting that
                work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also welcome and support the Minister’s
                statement that the strategy emphasises the need for balanced
                development across the region. The Committee was concerned that
                the strategy would place too much emphasis on the Greater
                Belfast area and would neglect rural areas. The strategy must
                reflect the needs of all parts of Northern Ireland, urban and
                rural, and I welcome the fact that the Minister has taken
                account of those views and has ensured that the regional
                development strategy gives due regard to the importance of
                balanced development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Successful implementation of the strategy is
                vital. The Committee debated the draft plans for implementation
                extensively and made certain recommendations to the Minister. As
                the strategy is cross-departmental, it is essential that all
                Departments support it, co-operate, and play their roles fully
                in implementing it in order to ensure its credibility and ensure
                the achievement of its aims. I cannot overemphasize that the
                regional development framework is not simply for the Department
                for Regional Development; it is for all Departments. It is an
                all-embracing strategy affecting areas as diverse as the
                environment, housing, rural development, tourism, business and
                employment opportunities. Consequently, it is a framework that
                must overarch the work of all Departments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The strategy represents a golden opportunity
                for all of us to create a vibrant and cohesive society with a
                strong local economy, supported by excellent public services
                throughout Northern Ireland. I welcome the intention to
                establish an interdepartmental steering group, to be chaired by
                the Minister for Regional Development. I also welcome plans to
                monitor and evaluate the implementation of the strategy
                carefully. The Regional Development Committee is committed to
                playing its role in scrutinising progress in these areas and
                ensuring the successful implementation of the strategy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The strategy will be vital for future
                development and planning control. Developers and builders must
                also support and co-operate with the implementation of the
                strategy to ensure that its aims are achieved. In particular, I
                refer to the development of brownfield sites in urban areas. The
                Committee welcomes the setting of the challenging target of 60%
                in regard to the use of brownfield sites and urges everyone
                involved in the development of housing to take every opportunity
                to avail of such sites.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Minister is aware, the Committee
                pushed the Department very hard on that issue. As recently as
                the Committee meeting of 12 September, the Committee proposed an
                amendment to the text of the document at page 73 to include an
                additional reference to the 60% target for brownfield
                development. I am pleased that the Minister has accepted the
                amendment. It reflects a deep and genuine concern on the part of
                the Committee to seek to ensure that there is a real commitment
                to developing urban housing, rather than building on greenfield
                sites.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister’s acceptance of the amendment
                is a reassurance to the Committee and the many others who
                lobbied the Committee and who are concerned about the future
                development of our urban areas. I am pleased that the Department
                will drive forward a strategy with the primary objective of
                developing brownfield sites. A clear message must be sent to
                developers, and the rules must be made clear to planners:
                brownfield options must be exhausted before consideration can be
                given to building on greenfield sites. That condition is crucial
                to ensuring that our cities and towns are regenerated and made
                much more attractive. The Committee welcomes the strategy’s
                sequential approach to choosing sites for development and urges
                that greenfield sites be used as a last resort only.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The impact of the regional transportation
                strategy is also vital to the successful implementation of the
                regional development strategy. The vision of a modern,
                sustainable and safe transportation system, which benefits
                society, the economy and the environment and which actively
                contributes to social inclusion, must be realised to underpin
                and support the regional development strategy. The Regional
                Development Committee will continue to work with the Department
                to ensure that a viable transportation strategy is developed and
                implemented as soon as possible. I wish the regional
                transportation conference on 28 September every success. It will
                be an important public consultation. I hope that it will be
                constructive and used by the Department.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I urge the Minister and the Department to
                implement speedily the strategy. I also urge all other involved
                bodies, including Departments and district councils, to play a
                full and honest role in its implementation. I also urge the
                Department to press on with the development and implementation
                of the regional transportation strategy, which will be a vital
                complement to the regional development strategy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Deputy Chairperson of the Regional
                Development Committee, Mr McFarland said on 2 July,</p>

                must be found to ensure that the improvements to our roads and

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This problem can be addressed in part through
                the allocation of additional funding under the Executive
                programme funds. I urge the Minister to make a strong case for
                such funding to the Minister of Finance and Personnel.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank those Committees that provided
                constructive commentary on the regional development strategy. I
                pay particular tribute to the Regional Development Committee,
                which worked very hard to painstakingly examine and study the
                various drafts of the strategy. They have made useful and
                constructive suggestions to guide and advise the Department, and
                we now have a strategy that provides a vital framework for the
                future development of this region over the next 25 years and
                beyond.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. The Committee
                unanimously supports the strategy document, and I ask Members to
                agree the report and allow the Minister to begin the
                implementation of this vital strategy.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for
                Regional Development (Mr McFarland):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the document and associate myself
                with the Chairperson’s remarks. I pay tribute to the Minister
                and his colleagues in the Department for their close
                co-operation, which is probably a model of co-operation that
                other Committees should look at because of its excellence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At last we have a plan to take Northern
                Ireland forward. However, it needs to be co-ordinated. The
                Minister, notwithstanding the Committee, might want to look at
                the possibility of an executive steering committee as a way of
                tying the Executive and the Ministers into supporting the
                strategy. It could be that if particular Ministers were to
                object to the strategy, there might be a difficulty at
                ministerial level rather than at Executive level. He might
                consider such a committee if things were not to move forward at
                the speed that he would wish them to.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The targets for brownfield sites, which the
                Chairperson mentioned, are ambitious: they depend on the urban
                capacity study. When we discussed this issue we understood that
                60% was a high target. The logic behind it is that if we have
                such a target, subject to confirmation from the urban capacity
                study, we stand some chance of achieving it. If a low target is
                set, we would almost certainly achieve it, but that would not do
                what we are trying to do, which is to encourage brownfield
                development in urban areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A change of planning ethos comes with the
                document, and that is something that developers should pay close
                attention to. The document changes the practice of building and
                development in Northern Ireland forever. Its fundamental ethos
                is that we look at our environment and pay closer attention to
                it. We cannot any longer simply build where we wish to; sadly,
                that, has been the practice over the last number of years. We
                have only to look at our constituencies to see that that is the
                case. This is one issue that will unite all 108 Members. There
                are planning problems in our constituencies due to builders and
                developers building in an unplanned way. It is to be hoped that
                the regional development strategy will get a grip on that
                situation and solve the problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards how the strategy might be advanced
                and the issues developed, I have particular pet issues that I
                would like to share with the House. First, there is the use of
                existing rural sites. Throughout Northern Ireland’s rural
                community there are sites where buildings have started to fall
                down. For some reason we seem to ignore rebuilding on those
                sites because it is cheaper to build on new greenfield ones. We
                should look at rural communities and build on existing sites.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, we have all had experience of
                developers. Behind my property a perfectly serviceable house was
                knocked completely flat because it was cheaper for the owner to
                do that and build a new house than to extend the existing one.
                It is absolutely crazy. I appreciate that such matters are not
                necessarily the Minister’s responsibility, but they are part
                of the whole business of planning and strategy, and we need to
                look at them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need a co-ordinated transport network, and
                the regional transportation strategy will help us with that.
                When driving a goods vehicle from Dungannon, one can hurtle up
                the M1 — or if coming from Ballymena, one can hurtle down the
                M2. However, the moment that one hits the Westlink, one
                virtually stops. It is ridiculous in this day and age — and
                the Minister has got this issue in hand. It is crazy not to have
                a system that allows drivers to get through Belfast quickly. We
                need a system for taking goods rapidly to our airports,
                railheads and seaports.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That needs to be developed as part of this
                sort of strategy. Northern Ireland’s links across the Irish
                Sea need to be improved. Yesterday I headed off down the A75 —
                a road beloved of us all — when travelling with my children to
                university. The Assembly must work with the Scottish Parliament
                to sort out some way of improving our east-west links; they are
                not fit for the twenty-first century.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rural roads must also be tackled, as Members
                from west of the Bann will know well. From Lough Neagh eastward
                one can get to most places fairly quickly. However, in the west
                of the Province the key transport corridors must be improved to
                allow the emergency services and others to get around and have
                fast access.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a good day. The strategy gives firm
                leadership. I commend the Minister and the Department for
                Regional Development and urge the House to support the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr R Hutchinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I join the Chairperson and the Deputy
                Chairperson of the Committee for Regional Development in
                congratulating the Minister on the document. I would also like
                to thank the many departmental officers who took time over
                recent months to come to the Committee and explain in detail the
                many aspects of the regional development strategy (RDS). That
                has been helpful. It has added to the smooth running of the
                process and contributed towards our eventually getting to the
                stage where the Committee could give its total support to the
                Minister’s plans.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The regional development strategy is a
                wide-ranging document of considerable content. Twenty-five years
                seems a long time, but, as Members know, time has a habit of
                creeping up on us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister tell the House if all the
                councils in Northern Ireland have finished their area plans and
                if those plans were taken into account when pen was put to paper
                on the document? Have some councils neglected to get their plans
                produced? It is important that every council has an input to the
                regional development strategy, and I wonder if that has
                happened.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Housing is a subject that people in Northern
                Ireland hold dear. The document states that the Minister seeks
                to widen opportunity and choice and to improve the supply and
                quality of housing; no Member would disagree with that. It also
                states that he wants to promote sustainable development. The
                last two Members who spoke put some emphasis on development in
                greenfield and brownfield sites. Every Member realises that
                there must come a time when builders are brought to account. For
                too long there have been builders in Northern Ireland who seem
                to have been able to build where they want, when they want and
                how they want. Under the regional development strategy it is
                hoped that that will stop, and I am glad that we will begin to
                see sensible developments — not just in Belfast but throughout
                the Province. For that reason I welcome the document’s housing
                policy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All Members want a vital, modern and safe
                transport system. Those of us who have travelled in Europe have
                been amazed at the modern railway and road transport systems
                that seem to be the norm with our European cousins.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the end of September we will have a taste
                of what will be in the transport strategy programme when 300
                people will be brought together. The strategy will be put before
                them, and they will provide feedback.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister take another look at some
                of the railway systems? At the Regional Development Committee
                meeting last Wednesday alarm bells rang in some Members’ ears
                when we were told that some of the lines may be mothballed. I
                realise that money cannot be thrown at everything, but will the
                Minister consider that some of those railways take people to
                ports and to crossings between Northern Ireland and Scotland?
                That needs to be given grave consideration.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Belfast metropolitan area plan.
                No one can oppose investment in our capital city, which has
                borne the brunt of terrorism for far too long. I congratulate
                the Minister on that plan, as well as on the Londonderry one.
                However, will he remember that there are several significant
                rural towns that also need some type of investment? Together
                with three of my colleagues, I met with development officers
                from Larne on Friday afternoon. They are looking for a way to
                revitalise their town and buildings and bring people back into
                the town. I thank the Minister for the document, and I am glad
                to support it. I wish him well in the future.</p>

                Ba mhaith liom cúpla pointe ginearálta a dhéanamh faoin
                straitéis, gan rud ar bith a athrá a dúradh cheana féin. The
                Committee has spent a considerable amount of time and effort
                discussing the regional development strategy. There has been
                frequent consultation with the Minister and the Department’s
                officials, and I thank them for persevering with the Committee
                on the issues raised.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The regional development strategy is a
                critical document, which will have interdepartmental
                consequences in developing the region over the next 25 years.
                The strategy provides for that period, so the document should
                contain a vision of how we would like to see the region at the
                end of that time. In the context of the Good Friday Agreement,
                the vision should be one of social inclusion, economic
                development, equality in environment and equality for people
                across the region. The strategy sets out those themes as part of
                its objective.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The effectiveness of the strategy will depend
                on its implementation by each of the Departments, with
                co-operation from social and voluntary bodies. It will also be
                dependent on the financial resources available.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is proposed to alter the schedule to the
                Strategic Planning Order (Northern Ireland) 1999 so that
                departmental development plans, particularly those of the
                Department of the Environment and the Department for Social
                Development, will conform to the strategy as opposed to being
                consistent with it. The reasoning is that full consistency with
                the strategy requirement could create unnecessary and
                undesirable flexibility in the development plans.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept that reasoning, but to have plans
                that, in general, conform with the strategy does not mean that
                the strategy can be ignored, sidelined or weakened because of
                other considerations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s intention to
                establish an interdepartmental steering group to ensure the
                strategy’s implementation, to monitor and evaluate its
                progress and to provide an annual report to the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Financial constraints, particularly on
                transport and the transportation system, will be a major factor
                in the strategy’s success. The Minister referred to the
                regional transport strategy that is currently under
                consultation. That strategy will consider possible sources of
                finance. However, we must be realistic about the starting point
                for all aspects of the strategy, not just transportation. It is
                a sobering thought that the current available budget for
                essential road maintenance in the region supplies only half of
                the necessary funding. We must bear in mind that such financial
                constraints will determine both the strategy’s effectiveness
                and its outcome.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tough decisions must be made to agree the
                regional development strategy on transportation, especially as
                regards the sources of finance. If we go by current budgetary
                allocations, we will have to consider sources of finance other
                than public spending.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The regional transport strategy recognises
                that meeting future transport demands through road improvements
                and unrestrained car use is not a sustainable option. It
                recognises the need to focus on moving people and goods within,
                into and out of the region, rather than on an increase in the
                number of vehicles. Moreover, it recognises the need to change
                travel culture through more responsible car use. Hard decisions
                will have to be made on those issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The strategy’s aim is to change travel
                culture and to extend travel choice. Reform of a travel culture
                that sees private car use as the primary means of transport will
                require a viable and attractive public transportation system.
                Other measures such as reasonable journey duration and cost may
                be needed to encourage people to choose public transport ahead
                of the private car, particularly in larger urban centres and
                their hinterlands.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The regional development strategy document is
                a vision for the next 25 years. On other occasions, I have
                referred to a lack of vision concerning the future of the region’s
                rail network. The strategy refers to the long-term options to
                complete a circular link from Belfast to Bleach Green, Antrim,
                Lisburn and back to Belfast, to create a rapid transit system in
                the Belfast metropolitan area and to enhance the lines from
                Belfast to Derry and to Dublin.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept the railway taskforce report, which
                looks at the short-term future of the rail network. The report
                opts to consolidate the existing rail network for a short-term
                period of three to five years. However, if the regional
                development strategy is to move towards equality and social
                inclusion across the region, there should be a long-term plan to
                extend the rail network through Portadown to places such as
                Armagh, Omagh and Strabane. I hope that when formulating the
                regional transportation strategy, that will be addressed more
                positively.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Partnership is the guiding principle for
                implementation of the strategy, which states that plans for the
                development of the region will be fully implemented only if
                there is co-operation with our neighbours on this island and
                with Britain. There must be co-operation on this island on
                transportation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The focus of a cross-border transportation
                system tends to be on routes from Larne to Dún Laoghaire and
                from Belfast to Dublin. Historically, under direct rule, there
                has been a focus on the Belfast metropolitan area. The issue of
                balance between the Belfast metropolitan area and Derry and
                rural areas has been raised during the Committee’s work, but
                there must be a localised focus on cross-border transportation,
                if towns such as Enniskillen, Omagh and Armagh city are to reach
                their full development potential.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Brownfield sites were discussed at length by
                the Committee. Several Members referred to them during the
                debate on July 2, and I do not want to repeat the arguments. The
                Minister has accepted that a clear signal must be sent on the
                development of brownfield sites. However, the strategy sets a
                target of 60% brownfield development by 2010. That will depend
                on the result of the survey that is being carried out on the
                land database as regards availability.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The availability of a site, and the extent of
                that land database, will be influenced by the Minister’s
                commitment to the development of brownfield sites. Developers
                must understand that it is not a matter of what they want to do
                or can do; it is a matter of what they must do. If the
                &quot;must do&quot; message is sent, the availability of sites
                for brownfield development will increase.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I want to talk about the more local
                issue of Warrenpoint harbour. Warrenpoint is about four miles
                from Newry’s town centre, linked, as is said in the strategy,
                by a dual carriageway. All port traffic to and from Warrenpoint
                harbour must go through Newry’s town centre. If Warrenpoint is
                to remain a sustainable and competitive port over the next 20
                years, consideration will have to be given to linking the
                harbour with the Newry bypass, thus avoiding the town centre.</p>

                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Neeson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like other Members, I welcome the report,
                which is based on the principle of sustainability, and I
                congratulate the Department on the consultation process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some time ago the process of consultation
                began with a public meeting in Belfast. The consultation process
                has been wide ranging and time consuming. However, it is
                important to get it right. In the Minister’s introduction to
                the report, he was realistic enough to concede that there must
                be some form of flexibility. The report reflects the benefits of
                devolution for the people of Northern Ireland, and those must be
                recognised. Although the Department for Regional Development is
                taking the lead, it is important to ensure that there is an
                interdepartmental approach to carrying out the plan,
                particularly in relation to social, economic, transport and
                environmental issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The process must develop in tangent with the
                area plans, and it must be consistent. It will come as no
                surprise that one of my major interests is the development and
                delivery of the Belfast metropolitan area plan.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have one concern. If there is to be an
                interdepartmental approach towards delivering the proposals,
                better co-ordination is needed between Departments, particularly
                between the Department of the Environment and the Department for
                Regional Development. As the Minister knows, a major business
                development in my constituency has been delayed because the two
                Departments have not agreed on the final process. It is to be
                hoped that this can be resolved quickly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also welcome the proposals for a regional
                transport policy for Northern Ireland. However, I have serious
                concerns about the required funding. The Department of Finance
                and Personnel needs to recognise the importance of the report.
                It would be remiss of me not to mention the problems of the A2
                from Carrickfergus to Belfast. This is an example of area
                overdevelopment where inadequate infrastructure has been
                introduced to deal with the subsequent transport issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many Members representing metropolitan areas
                will welcome the proposed introduction of the Belfast Lough
                ferry service — a novel idea. There have been experiments with
                ferry services in other cities worldwide, and I hope that when
                the project gets off the ground it will be a success.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s statement about
                brownfield sites. Members have been lobbied strongly by
                interested parties throughout Northern Ireland. The Minister and
                the Department should perhaps concede that this is the best
                approach, as it should set a target that I hope is achievable,
                particularly in urban areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that the Assembly monitor
                progress on the railways. I hope that the new rail sets will
                come into operation sooner rather than later, together with the
                improvements required for various lines.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue of transport must be examined from
                an external point of view as well as an internal one.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Members may know, the Enterprise, Trade
                and Investment Committee travelled to Brussels and Copenhagen
                last week with the Sabena travel company. Unfortunately, Sabena
                intends to withdraw that route soon. Brussels is one of many
                important international links. If Northern Ireland is to develop
                as a region of the European Union, external transport links are
                vital.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must ensure that the general
                infrastructure — not just roads and railways — is adequate.
                There must be a level playing field; in particular, I stress
                that the natural gas pipeline to Derry must be developed. The
                Assembly should do all that it can to ensure that that project
                happens.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must examine social issues at local and
                regional level. If the plan is to be implemented to the maximum
                benefit of the people of Northern Ireland, affordable public
                sector housing, good health and education services and modern
                retailing facilities must be provided. The Planning Service must
                adhere to realistic guidelines if we are to protect our
                countryside. Members must remember that some rural areas are
                among the poorest in Northern Ireland. The necessary public
                transport facilities should be provided in those areas. On its
                visit to Denmark last week, the Committee learnt much about the
                kind of sustainable waste management programme that we need for
                Northern Ireland. We should consider that issue for Northern
                Ireland as a whole. The strategy document is of vital importance
                to our future.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I said on 2 July that the document was a good
                start. However, the strategy is meant to cover 25 years, and I
                am concerned that it is not yet good enough.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members should look back to 1975. We had not
                heard about the information superhighway — our superhighway
                was the Westlink. Bill Gates was a child. Life has changed
                dramatically since 1975. Members must think about where we are
                likely to be then, and we must use our imagination and strategic
                long-term thinking to guide ourselves in that direction.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the work that has gone into the
                document, and I do not doubt that it is a starting point.
                However, we need much more commitment to change. We should think
                about cars that run on electricity and about energy supplied by
                the wind, waves or biomass. We must put people at the centre of
                policy, rather than cars and buildings. There should be children’s
                play areas on every street corner and green and pleasant land.
                That vision is within our reach. It is 25 years ahead. People
                are realising it elsewhere.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to be prepared to become much more
                radical in our approach to change, and we need to start now.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not convinced that the document will get
                us to where we need to be. I am disappointed that there have
                been no fundamental amendments as a result of the 2 July debate
                on the regional development strategy. That debate lasted several
                hours, and I understood that it was to serve as a contribution
                to the consultation process and result in amendments to the
                document. Six amendments were made as a result of the debate,
                but I will stand corrected if the Minister can show me that the
                document has since been radically changed. One amendment
                provided for the adjustment of a diagram so that it includes
                Harry Avery’s Castle near Newtownstewart. I concede that it is
                important that the castle be included in the diagram, but where
                are the fundamental amendments based on the debate that took
                place in the Assembly on 2 July?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Admittedly, the Minister has been lobbied on
                the use of brownfield sites, and there was movement on that
                issue even at the last minute after the Regional Development
                Committee lobbied the matter further. That is to be welcomed,
                although we have always said that we should go beyond the 60%
                mark. We need to listen to people, but the strategy does not
                comprise a listening exercise, which is a vital ingredient.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will detail four areas in which more should
                and could be done: planning; transport, with special reference
                to road safety; leisure, including children’s play strategies
                and youth leisure strategies; and environment and energy policy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Greater account needs to be taken of
                communities when planning decisions are made. For a long time we
                have called for the implementation of a community impact
                assessment. Environmental impact assessments are made, and we
                worry about what the birds, bees, flowers and trees think about
                a new building, but we do not ask the neighbours. How many times
                do I need to say that? A community impact assessment would mean
                that the developer would be obliged to consult the neighbours
                before putting up a building. That is a vital factor — it is
                the way to listen to the community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have already said that we should match the
                legislation of other countries. In the South of Ireland a
                children’s play facility must be provided with every hundred
                houses that are built. Returning to the idea of swings and
                slides, we have huge sprawling housing developments without one
                area for children to play in. When are we going to bring about
                legislation to force that change? It will not happen otherwise.
                Alternatively, shall we retain the cul-de-sac kid mentality
                towards which we are moving? We say that kids can play on the
                streets while we worry about the safety of our car parking
                spaces.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the issue of transport, I am very
                concerned about road safety. Traffic calming areas around
                schools, hospitals and residential areas are vital. A nod in
                that direction is made in the strategy; I welcome that, but it
                is not enough. The vital issue of public transport has been
                raised. We should be moving into an era of reduced car use and
                increased use of public transport. Why are we not pushing far
                harder for more investment in public transport? We should be
                investing in tram systems, light rail systems, buses and cycle
                lanes. A good deal more needs to be done.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In regard to leisure, have we forgotten about
                the importance of children’s play and how it can help kids’
                futures? Youth leisure is also required to get our young people
                off the streets. There are not nearly enough facilities for the
                under-fives and the under-17s. We need to focus, if only at
                local council level, on the need to create children’s play
                strategies so that we have play parks, children’s areas, youth
                leisure areas, skateboard parks and other such amenities. We
                cannot forget them. They are just as important as car parking.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My thoughts on the environment and energy
                have been much influenced by the recent trip by the Enterprise,
                Trade and Investment Committee to Denmark to study energy policy
                — something that Sean Neeson has also mentioned. We must do
                more to prepare ourselves for the huge changes that will take
                place in the next 25 years. Next year, for example, there will
                be changes regarding our dependency on oil. There will also be a
                need for us to move into the renewable energy sector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In chapter 12, paragraph 5.1 (‘Consider the
                implications of climate change’), of ‘Shaping our Future’
                it is stated that we must</p>

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should be able to identify key areas for
                action, such as promoting wind energy, wave technology, tidal
                technology and biomass schemes. If it is being done in Denmark,
                there is no reason why we should not do it. What is stopping us?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was pleased to hear the issue of waste
                management mentioned earlier. Denmark is not even a thousand
                miles away from us, and it has a waste management strategy.
                Denmark is way ahead of us. We need guidance, direction and
                greater imagination.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the hard work that has gone into
                the document. I welcome the fact that there was a consultation
                process. I also welcome the Minister’s commitment to joined-up
                government, which is something we desperately need. I make an
                appeal to everyone who may be involved in any steering committee
                set up to implement the document: do not close this book —
                changes will be required very soon, and we must be prepared for
                them.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first round of Members from each party
                has now finished. In the past 10 minutes, many Members have
                expressed a wish to speak. Therefore, I must reluctantly limit
                each Member’s time to six minutes, in order to allow the
                Minister to wind up.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Byrne:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the motion and the finalisation of
                the regional development strategy. The strategy offers the
                opportunity to start a dynamic development plan for Northern
                Ireland over the next 25 years. I welcome the Minister’s
                comments on how an implementation process for the strategy can
                be delivered. We need to have five- yearly reviews on the
                strategy’s development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The ‘Shaping our Future’ project has been
                a good post-devolution consultation exercise for Northern
                Ireland. The Department for Regional Development’s plan has
                been published after extensive consultation and enhanced
                drafting over a two-year period. Senior departmental officials
                have been sensitive and professional in their approach to
                finalising this important public development project for
                Northern Ireland. As a member of the Regional Development
                Committee, I appreciate the due consideration they gave to our
                concerns and views throughout the consultation and development
                process. In his meetings with the Committee, the Minister showed
                due regard and consideration for the various issues that we put
                to him.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the fact that the regional
                development strategy recognises the importance of the promotion
                of social cohesion and economic development, along with equality
                of opportunity and spatial equity throughout the region. I also
                welcome the Minister’s comments on a balanced urban/rural
                approach to development for the future. That is very welcome for
                Northern Ireland at this stage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The concept of decentralisation of services
                is addressed in the strategy, and that is welcome. However, I
                would like the Executive to lead by example. Entire sections of
                Departments should be moved out of Belfast and relocated to
                realise the vision of balanced development right across the
                region. Overall, the strategy is innovative and dynamic,
                addressing many of our concerns about issues covered in earlier
                drafts. It contains many positive proposals relating to urban
                and rural development, transportation strategy, housing needs,
                environmental concerns and the tourism infrastructure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Transport policy is vital to ensuring that
                the core principles of equality, choice, efficiency and
                accessibility, as well as environmental concerns and public
                safety issues, are taken into consideration. I am aware that the
                Department is currently devising a regional transportation
                strategy, and the Regional Development Committee is engaged in
                deliberations on that. The commitments to improve cross- border
                road and rail links are also welcome. It is important that the
                transport infrastructure be upgraded in an all-Ireland and
                European context. The measures to upgrade roads in Northern
                Ireland are long overdue, and I am pleased to read that this
                strategy proposes a more integrated approach to transportation
                in rural areas. That will improve accessibility, with, I hope,
                the objective of sustaining rural communities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This strategy is an imaginative document with
                the capacity to address the problems associated with the uneven
                development of the region in the past. It is to be hoped that
                its proposals are not rigid and that they can be adapted and
                tailored, as circumstances require, to ensure that the
                principles of equality and social justice remain at its core.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the key tasks will be implementation.
                Securing the necessary financial resources will be the major
                task in realising the delivery of the regional development
                strategy. I hope that the interdepartmental steering group will
                tackle this problem in a committed way, particularly given the
                need for a lot of expenditure on transport infrastructure and
                water and sewerage investment needs. I welcome the fact that the
                steering group will be co-ordinating the implementation of the
                development strategy. The devising of local area plans is now
                very necessary. In my constituency, both Omagh and Strabane
                councils are awaiting the drawing up of the west Tyrone area
                plan. It is most important that it be drawn up as soon as
                possible so that the regional development strategy can be
                connected into it. A joined-up government approach will be
                necessary to deliver the implementation of this plan. This
                development plan offers a template for Northern Ireland’s
                future. If we can achieve joined-up government among
                Departments, in collaboration with the district councils, then
                we can deliver social and economic development for all our
                people across the region.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the Minister’s motion and
                congratulate him and the Department for bringing forward a
                radical and important document for the development of Northern
                Ireland.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Armstrong:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to express my thanks to all involved
                in preparing the regional development strategy document. As an
                elected representative for Mid Ulster, I regard ‘Shaping our
                Future’ as being of particular relevance. The area that I
                represent has many longstanding social and economic problems
                that need to be addressed. I hope that this document can provide
                equality for all people living in rural areas. The document
                raises awareness of several key issues that must be remembered
                when developing a 25-year plan to rejuvenate Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland has a population of
                approximately one and a half million people, of which 60% live
                outside the cities of Belfast and Londonderry, and we must
                spread our resources fairly and not just around the east or west
                of the Province. ‘Shaping our Future’ aims to tackle
                inequality in health, education and living standards.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recently hospital services in Mid Ulster were
                cut back. Initially we were told that it was a temporary
                measure, but that was only to soften the blow. If the Hayes
                Report recommendations are fully implemented, Tyrone will be
                without accident and emergency and maternity services. I cannot
                reconcile those developments with Government calls for equality.
                Where is the healthy living environment for the people of Mid
                Ulster?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The quality of many roads in Mid Ulster is
                another cause of concern. If hospital services are to be moved
                away from our area, the infrastructure needs to be upgraded. The
                safety of Mid Ulster residents is at stake because of the poor
                condition of our roads.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The document mentions the environment,
                community life and rural society. I support facilities such as
                churches, community organisations and other voluntary groups
                that contribute to the sense of belonging that is so often
                absent in rural settings. In my constituency, agriculture plays
                a vital part. Retailers in rural towns rely on farmers to buy
                their goods, and all benefit from the industry. For example,
                Cookstown is known as a market town, as it is built on
                agricultural roots.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept the need to look ahead when
                considering the development of Northern Ireland. I agree with
                the notion of diversification, yet to many farmers that means
                only one thing — building a golf course. Agriculture has been
                hit by successive disasters in the past decade. BSE and
                foot-and-mouth disease did most miserable damage to the
                industry, and the problems were compounded by financial factors
                such as trade enlargement, market globalisation and the strong
                pound.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is one thing to suggest diversification;
                actually doing it is another. Farming is a way of life, not
                simply a job. Our farmers receive unfair treatment at the hands
                of those organisations that process or retail their products.
                For example, they get 18p for a litre of milk, yet it is sold in
                the shops for 90p. Revenue has been drained from rural areas
                because of unfair markets. That problem needs to be addressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Successful and sustainable development
                requires using those resources that we have on a scale and
                quality not enjoyed elsewhere. Tourism has enormous potential,
                and we can attract people to the natural and unspoilt beauty of
                Northern Ireland. Our rural areas would benefit from tourism,
                and I support the Sperrins and Lough Neagh as attractions. We
                need to raise awareness of such natural beauty spots as well as
                provide amenities for tourists.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Magherafelt has witnessed impressive levels
                of growth, particularly between 1981 and 1996. Its population
                has grown by almost one third, the second largest growth in any
                Northern Ireland urban centre. In addition, that population
                growth in the past year has been double the Northern Ireland
                average, and I am disappointed at the report’s failure to
                recognise Magherafelt as a town of great potential.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the past 10 years it has faced many
                constraints to its growth. For example, sufficient land has not
                been allocated for industrial, commercial and housing purposes.
                However, in spite of all those difficulties Magherafelt has
                achieved those impressive figures, and the town has an important
                infrastructure asset in its connection to the A29, which runs
                from Newry to Coleraine. In addition, the town is located in the
                centre of the Province, so I ask that Magherafelt be classified
                as a main hub.</p>

                action under the regional development plan will affect the Mid
                Ulster constituency, which has been underdeveloped for far too
                long.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr William McCrea:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The difficulty that we face in Mid Ulster is
                that no Member from there is on the Committee. While the
                Committee has done a good job, and I commend both the Committee
                and the Minister for their general approach, there are concerns
                for the area that I represent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Magherafelt, a part of the Mid Ulster
                constituency, has not been designated as a main hub town. I
                cannot understand that. I notice that Cookstown has, and I
                welcome that. The problem is that it seems to put Magherafelt
                against Cookstown. I was born in the Cookstown area; I reside in
                the Magherafelt area; and I believe that both these towns should
                have been classified as main hubs. Seventeen or 18 of the
                district councils are identified on the map as main hubs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Magherafelt’s development, and especially
                its industrial development, has been curbed by the fact that its
                area plan is too rigid and long out of date. We also find that
                our town had one of the highest growth rates in the whole of the
                Province. That does not seem to have been recognised in the
                summing up of the report. It is important that Magherafelt
                should be identified as a main hub, and if it does not mean
                anything, why have other towns been identified as such? We all
                know that identification as a main hub is important, and this
                document will be used for the development of the area in years
                to come.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have difficulties in this respect because
                when it comes to our fight to retain acute services in the
                Mid-Ulster Hospital, it will be shown that we are not identified
                in this plan as a main hub. I differ with the Member for Mid
                Ulster, Mr Armstrong, who said that if the hospital services are
                removed, the roads must be upgraded. I do not believe that we
                should be saying &quot;if the hospital is downgraded&quot;. If
                we are to have proper acute services and hospitalisation, we
                must not entertain the thought of our hospital’s being
                downgraded. Our roads need to be upgraded, and we have been
                pressing for that. It is one of the things that the Minister has
                been well aware of for years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have endeavoured to achieve a continuation
                of economic growth in the area. Land has been acquired by the
                Department at Craigs, which is outside Toomebridge in the
                Magherafelt district area. The fact that Magherafelt is not
                identified as a main hub area is going to hinder progress with
                our economic growth. While I appreciate all the other things
                that the Minister and the Committee have identified, it must be
                clearly seen that there will be problems as a result of the fact
                that Magherafelt district and town has not been classified as a
                main hub area for future development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is acknowledged that the figures for
                housing are higher for Magherafelt than for neighbouring towns,
                yet for some reason that was not recognised by classification as
                a main hub. I appeal to the Department, and I still appeal to
                the Committee, to look further at this matter and make
                recommendations on it. I trust that this is not so rigid that it
                cannot be adapted if required. Magherafelt is vital to the
                economic development of Mid Ulster and to the wider prosperity
                of our Province.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a concern that some areas of the
                Province, identified for large increases in housing numbers,
                could be overdeveloped. They could lose their identity. Some of
                the smaller towns surrounding such areas could find themselves
                consumed completely. Smaller towns do not want to lose their
                identity, and it should not happen.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If areas in the Province have been identified
                as growth areas, it is essential that proper road networks
                accompany such growth. Many roads are already chock-a-block.
                Putting large numbers of houses into such areas without road
                networks would not be in their best interests.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While giving a general welcome to the
                strategy, I ask the Minister to seriously consider its
                deficiency with respect to the Magherafelt District Council
                area.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Doherty:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A LeasCheann Comhairle, I give critical
                acceptance to the report. I accept the plan’s value and
                recognise the time, energy and commitment of the Minister, his
                officials and the Regional Development Committee, and its work
                with the Department.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is clear that departmental thinking links
                regional development with the priorities of ‘Strategy 2010’,
                the economic development strategy document. However, ‘Strategy
                2010’ has been widely criticised for its top-down approach,
                its continuation of failed policies, its bias towards the
                Belfast area at the expense of the western and southern parts of
                the Six Counties and its presentation of the economy as being
                almost completely dependent on British policy decisions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Earlier this year, the Committee for
                Enterprise, Trade and Investment advanced a report to the House
                that was accepted by all Assembly parties. One of the key
                aspects of that report was the fact that infrastructure is a
                tool of the economy. We must recognise that the infrastructural
                tool we have now is not adequate to sustain a growing economy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I draw the attention of the House to three of
                the many recommendations that were accepted. Recommendation 13
                speaks of regional disparities:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Committee recommends that the
                Economic Development Forum needs to address the regional
                disparities within the Northern Ireland economy and promote
                distinctive measures to redress the geographical
                imbalances.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recommendations 24 and 25 mention transport
                infrastructure. Recommendation 24 states:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Committee recommends a massive
                injection of funding over the next 10 years to develop a world
                class transport infrastructure within all regions of Northern
                Ireland to bring it into line with the needs of a modern world
                class economy, taking into account the legal equality duties and
                policies.&quot;</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recommendation 25 states:</p>

                increased co-operation.&quot;</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask the Minister, when he sets up his
                interdepartmental committee, to take on board the agreed
                recommendations of the Enterprise, Trade and Investment
                Committee. He should not base his recommendations and way
                forward on ‘Strategy 2010’ as it was written originally.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a need to take on board what was
                said by the Committee and accepted by all parties on the
                Committee. I also note that the Minister’s time frame is 25
                years. Very few people in the House will be around in 25 years’
                time. Some of us might be. I therefore urge the Minister to have
                annual or biannual progress reports in the interim.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask the Minister to have an ongoing look at
                the road from Strabane to Aughnacloy in my constituency of West
                Tyrone. There is a need for a fundamental and continual
                upgrading of that thoroughfare.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is currently a huge debate in counties
                Tyrone and Fermanagh in relation to the Hayes Report. One of the
                key points in a rural context is accessibility to hospitals. The
                responsibility for that matter lies with the Department for
                Regional Development. It must take the need for accessibility on
                board in a very clear and focused way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Transport, for instance, needs to be
                addressed on an all-Ireland basis. That was specifically
                provided for under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement’s 12
                areas of North/South co-operation. It is not being pursued
                actively enough. There needs to be a huge shift in official
                culture if informed co-ordination of cross-border planning is to
                be achieved. Nevertheless, this report deserves study. We must
                engage with it in a very critical way. I hope that the result
                will be a better document and a better way forward.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Bradley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I, as the Committee Chairperson and other
                Members have done, wish to compliment the Minister on his
                handling of the consultation process since he inherited the role
                of Minister for Regional Development. I welcome the fact that we
                have reached the stage where the Assembly is being asked to
                agree the regional development strategy. On Monday 2 July, when
                Members debated a motion on the progress of the report, 17
                Members made largely supportive comments on the content of the
                publication titled ‘Shaping Our Future’. I want to follow up
                some of the observations and comments that I made in that
                debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I expressed at that time a degree of
                disappointment that farming and farm-related matters had little
                or no mention in the document. I commented, however, that the
                promise of rural proofing by all ministerial Departments should
                ensure that the farming community gets equality of treatment
                when the strategy is up and running. I want to hear what plans
                the Minister has to assure those with agricultural interests
                that the regional development strategy will be thoroughly rural
                proofed, where appropriate, by his Department.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the upgrading of our major traffic
                corridors, I make a special plea to the Minister to use his
                influence to bring forward the programme for a dual carriageway
                on the A1 between Loughbrickland and Newry. I do that for a
                particular reason. As I made my way to the Assembly on Thursday
                morning last, I had to join other motorists making a detour in
                the Loughbrickland area due to a traffic accident on the A1.
                Sadly, that accident proved to be fatal. A 69-year-old female
                tourist from France lost her life in a head-on collision on that
                terrible stretch of road. Coincidentally, that was the second
                time recently that I have had to make the same detour for a
                similar reason — sadly with a similar outcome.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The route I refer to forms a portion of the
                eastern seaboard corridor as printed in diagram 12 on page 162
                of the final text before us. Anything that the Minister can do
                to advance the proposals for that stretch of road will be
                greatly appreciated by the large number of daily commuters who
                use the A1 Newry to Belfast road.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I address my third comment on the strategy to
                those currently engaged in drawing up the new area plans. I
                recently attended public consultation meetings organised by the
                Planning Service in Rathfriland and Warrenpoint. Those meetings
                dealt specifically with the new Newry/ Banbridge area plan. On
                matters of rural development, there was widespread agreement
                among rural participants that the pending area plan would have
                to develop an attractive and prosperous rural area, based on a
                balanced and integrated approach to the development of town,
                village and countryside, to sustain a strong and vibrant rural
                community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I make no apology to the wordsmith for
                copying the words that he or she penned under the heading ‘Strategic
                Rural Development Objectives’ on page 93, which refers to the
                overall aim of the strategy:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;to develop an attractive and prosperous
                rural area, based on a balanced and integrated approach to the
                development of town, village and countryside, in order to
                sustain a strong and vibrant rural community&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am satisfied that the document’s declared
                aims are compatible with the overall wishes of the rural
                community. I can only add that planners should take note.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I share Jane Morrice’s concern
                about the level of attention paid to the comments on 2 July.
                Does the Minister still view the contributions made then as
                being helpful and relevant? I hope that his answer will be yes.
                I support the motion, and I call on the Minister to remember the
                debate on 2 July when he is implementing his strategy.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hussey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the strategy document. The Minister
                and his officials will recall the origins of the strategy, when
                the main area of concern and complaint from some Members was
                that we felt that what was being offered was the Belfast
                metropolitan area plan with a bolt-on to keep the country boys
                happy. All Members would agree that there has been considerable
                consultation since then, and I must praise the Minister, his
                predecessor and his departmental officials, who have proved that
                they can listen to the concerns of people beyond the Belfast
                area. They have produced a much more balanced regional document
                as a result.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I regard the strategy as a macro-statement
                that can only succeed as it evolves at the micro-level of area
                plans. Today, the Minister has heard many concerns about area
                plans that have gone past their sell-by date. I urge the
                Minister to use his considerable influence to ensure that area
                plans can now take centre stage, as their role is vital in
                achieving the aims of the overall expectations of this truly
                co-ordinated strategy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sure that the House will agree that the
                regional transport strategy will be vital. Within the transport
                strategy lies the means, not only of drawing the region together
                within the regional development strategy, but of ensuring the
                success of that development strategy at a local level,
                particularly with regard to the provision of services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I may become slightly parochial at this
                stage, when I refer to the Health Service, for example, and the
                concerns that many of us have regarding a local acute hospital
                in the south-west — most logically sited in the Omagh area. We
                need a transport system to ensure that those in Fermanagh who
                are concerned about this can get to the Omagh hospital within
                the &quot;golden hour&quot;. The Minister should understand that
                concern.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We look at the spatial framework and at
                people’s expectations about the various hubs that are to be
                established. Education and certain facilities are to be provided
                within such hubs. Accessibility — as Mr Doherty said — is
                vital. We need to ensure that the transport strategy put in
                place in the western area will guarantee people accessibility to
                the various services available. As much has already been said, I
                close by urging all Members to support the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome this very useful document. It is
                good to have strategic plans laid out in front of us. There are
                several areas in the document that I would like to address. In
                my constituency, the Department has, by and large, listened to
                most of what has been requested. Lisburn has been outlined as an
                area of high development potential, and the local council will
                have seen that. Lisburn would welcome the development of more
                housing and facilities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The buffer wedges that have been put in place
                between Belfast and Lisburn and between Belfast and the other
                council areas in the Belfast metropolitan area plan are also
                welcomed. It is essential that significant communities maintain
                their independent identities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also welcome the document’s indication
                that the Department for Regional Development is seeking more
                efficient links between areas such as Lisburn and Belfast. I
                welcome the circle line that is proposed in the regional
                development strategy. It is envisaged that the circle line will
                travel from Belfast to Antrim to Lisburn and back to Belfast.
                The Minister made a good move earlier this year when he
                maintained that line despite strong pressure on him to mothball
                it. I implore the Minister to maintain that stance and ensure
                that the circle line becomes a reality now that the Bleach Green
                line is in progress.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned about the significant
                expansion planned for Moira village. Moira is under severe
                pressure. Anyone who knows the village or travels through it to
                go to Lurgan or Portadown knows that they will hit a tailback in
                the evenings as soon as they come off the motorway. Moira will
                need a bypass in order to assist significant further
                development. That may be in the Department’s mind, but it
                needs to be made abundantly clear that any further development
                could be accommodated only if a bypass were built. I understand
                where the Department is coming from in wanting to develop a
                village such as Moira, because it has access to the motorway and
                the rail system. It is beneficial that it accesses the main
                corridors.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The application of caring for the environment
                is necessary, as not enough attention has been paid to the built
                environment until now. The section of the regional development
                strategy that deals with conservation could have been
                strengthened so that dwellings with large gardens could be left
                intact, rather than have developers opportunistically demolish
                them and replace them with large numbers of apartments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful that the Department identifies
                the problems of rural areas, particularly in relation to
                agriculture. However, less stringent criteria should be applied
                to those people who seek farm dwellings. It might be worthwhile
                for the Department to look to extend the green belt so that
                one-off sites could not be approved for individuals who merely
                wish to sell them on. The Department might also consider
                reducing the criteria that must be met to allow young people who
                live in the countryside, who have been brought up on farms and
                who wish to stay in the area, to get a house for themselves
                approved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is more necessary than ever to reduce the
                new criteria because more and more young people are having to
                farm part-time and take other jobs. In those instances, it is
                necessary for the young people to live on the farm because they
                work there for such a short time that it needs to be accessible.
                I ask the Department to re-examine those criteria.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to see a fairly large-scale
                development of small settlements and hamlets in the countryside,
                particularly in Greater Belfast. Young people cannot afford to
                buy houses in the area of Greater Belfast in which they were
                reared. They cannot afford to buy houses, particularly in
                Hillsborough and Moira. Demand for development land is so high
                that house prices are out of their reach. I would like to see
                more development of small hamlets in those areas to allow young
                people to stay in the areas in which they were raised.</p>

                I give the document a critical welcome. I welcome the changes
                that have been taken on board, particularly the upgrading of the
                north/south corridor — the A29 — which is important to the

                far-reaching development strategy. Unfortunately the ‘Shaping
                our Future’ strategy contains some shortcomings. However, with
                some flexibility in our interpretation, we can, perhaps,
                overcome some of those.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must put regional development in the
                context of the Good Friday Agreement. We want to create
                opportunities for people. The infrastructure of the area west of
                the Bann is in need of development. There is an opportunity to
                bring in new thinking and create regional hubs and key transport
                corridors. I agree with Rev William McCrea that roads are no
                replacement for hospitals. We must ensure that we have proper
                hospital facilities in the regional hubs, so that we do not have
                to depend on the road system. We need hospitals in the regional
                hubs. If we identify somewhere as a hub for one type of
                development, we cannot downgrade its status for another.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must abandon the approach that was taken
                in the past. It discriminated against people who lived west of
                the Bann, whether Catholic or Protestant. The infrastructure was
                not put in place; there was no development of the east-west
                corridor and no development of the motorway network. The M2 does
                not go beyond Antrim on the northern side of Lough Neagh, and,
                on the southern side, the M1 stops at Dungannon. The
                infrastructure and everything that goes along with it also stop
                there.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is clear that the Department’s thinking
                is still linked with ‘Strategy 2010’; that is a flaw. That
                document has been criticised for its top-down approach and lack
                of local consultation. We must take on board the need for local
                consultation and build a structure that people can get involved
                with. Now that we have a devolved Administration, we can ensure
                that we have local input.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The development of transport must be carried
                out in line with housing and community development. I agree with
                Jane Morrice, who said that we had an opportunity to enforce
                planning regulations and ensure that play areas become part of
                the local structure. Communities have been deprived of building;
                motorways are not the only infrastructure. Planners should adopt
                a &quot;play before build&quot; approach. During the PPP
                inquiry, we found that there were examples of developers being
                obliged to create play areas before they began to build massive
                housing estates. That protects the right of children to play.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We can interpret the strategy in our own way.
                We can put together a structure that will allow for planned
                development, as opposed to jumping from one area plan to
                another. I hope that all the area plans will be implemented, but
                I am concerned that a number of those plans will be out of date
                by the time that they are put in place. The plan for my area
                covers the period up to 2010 and is not yet complete. It will be
                2005 before it has been completed and the relevant inquiries
                held, so we will end up with a five-year plan. I encourage the
                Minister and the planning authorities to create a structure that
                will enable us to make more long-term plans for the environment
                and allow us to take account of local communities, the need for
                infrastructure and the importance of linking services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another important aspect is the link between
                rail and road services. Unfortunately, we have not taken on
                board the European concept of linking such services. In the few
                towns here that have railway stations, they are often located at
                one end of the town, while the bus station is at the other end.
                For example, a new bus station has been built in the centre of
                Newry, but there is just a rail stop in the town, instead of a
                proper station. The rail structure needs to be developed
                alongside the M1 to expand the network of linked services.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gallagher:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recognise the energy and effort that the
                Minister has put into seeking an agreed strategy. The widespread
                consultation that has taken place has undoubtedly been helpful.
                For example, road safety is to receive more attention. There is
                now an attempt to tackle the increasing numbers of fatal and
                serious road accidents, and measures such as traffic calming
                have been mentioned.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As elected representatives, many of us know
                that it is sometimes difficult to get a response from the
                Department for Regional Development on issues such as the
                introduction of speed limits, street lighting and improved
                signage. The strategy is a hopeful sign, and I hope that the
                Department will re-examine the criteria relating to these
                measures and remove any inconsistencies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The urban/rural balance needs to be attended
                to. There has been poor funding of roads in Fermanagh. There has
                been an imbalance in the allocation of funding, and that has
                been to the detriment of the west of the North of Ireland,
                especially Fermanagh. I hope that that will be improved, but the
                key transport corridors identified in diagram 10 of the strategy
                document suggest that the imbalance might well continue. In
                other parts of Northern Ireland the routes run east to west,
                north to south and diagonally, but there is only one key
                priority route in Fermanagh, and it runs from east to west. Many
                who live in that area and operate businesses there —
                regardless of their political allegiance — recognise the
                importance of North/South links. I want that issue to be looked
                at as the strategy progresses.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft strategy has emerged after the
                publication of the Hayes Report on future acute hospital
                provision, in which the matter of accessibility crops up
                repeatedly. I will not be as presumptuous or as partisan as the
                Member for West Tyrone, Mr Hussey, to say that one town would be
                better than another for the purposes of implementing the Hayes
                review. Everyone would agree that the Hayes review showed that
                future hospital provision must be based on certain and agreed
                principles that are in the best interests of everybody, whether
                they live in Omagh, Enniskillen, Antrim or County Down. The
                Enniskillen to Omagh road will be a key corridor in future
                hospital provision in the west of the Province. That road will
                have to be kept under review, and I hope that, before very long,
                it will be identified for funding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There have been strong statements on rural
                development and the importance of maintaining and promoting the
                rural community. It almost goes without saying that employment
                is central to rural development. A review of the Water Service
                is currently under way. Rationalising the service and reducing
                jobs have been mentioned. Over recent years, people from the
                west who have been involved with the service have seen jobs
                being moved elsewhere. I bring that to the Minister’s
                attention. I look forward to his response and to whether he will
                give a commitment that the review will not lead to further
                centralisation of the Water Service. People in the west of the
                Province generally want decentralisation in the range of
                services.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Beggs:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the bulk of the report and the
                degree of consultation that went into producing it. However, I
                have some reservations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I particularly welcome increasing the target
                for brownfield development to 60%. However, achieving that will
                require subsequent moves and perhaps subsequent changes in
                legislation. Making it a reality is not just a matter of setting
                a target. Practical aspects have to be established for the
                target to be achieved. How will developers be encouraged into
                town-centre regeneration, rather than perpetuating the doughnut
                effect that is occurring in many rural towns in Northern
                Ireland?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the report’s commitment to the
                continuing development of Larne as a gateway into Northern
                Ireland. Larne is one of the most important gateways, and the
                plans to continue the development of the potential of the Port
                of Larne, which is one of the largest roll-on/roll-off ferry
                facilities in the British Isles, are also to be welcomed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The trans-European network route between
                Larne and Dún Laoghaire has also been recognised and must be
                developed. However I must flag up some aspects of that route,
                particularly the urgent need to upgrade accident black spots on
                the A8, between Larne and Belfast, at the Millbrook and
                Ballyloran junctions, where there have been several fatalities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the report’s recognition of
                Carrickfergus as a heritage town. However, the town’s
                importance as an industrial centre and a service centre must
                also be recognised. There must be a more efficient linkage
                between Belfast and the neighbouring towns in the metropolitan
                area. Carrickfergus is the only one of those towns that does not
                have a four-lane carriageway linking it to the centre of
                Belfast. Indeed, investment on the A2 has been overlooked when
                its traffic usage is compared with other routes in Northern
                Ireland that have received funding for four-lane carriageways.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the concept of strengthening the
                regional rail system, under the heading of ‘Developing a
                Regional Transportation System’, contained in the report.
                While Carrickfergus is included in the Belfast metropolitan area
                for an increased rail service, I am concerned that Larne, which
                is a major gateway to Northern Ireland, is not mentioned in the
                report’s opening comments on the subject on page 159. Indeed,
                it is only later in the report — when discussing linkages —
                that Larne is mentioned.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The importance of the trans-European network
                rail route to Larne should be better appreciated in the
                development plan for our rail service. By encouraging more
                commuters from east Antrim and Larne to use the railway, we
                might minimise — or remove — the major daily road blockage
                at Mallusk.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members talked about the need for
                investment in hospitals and education in the west of the
                Province. Parts of the east of the Province have also suffered
                from underprovision. The hospitals in Larne and Carrickfergus
                have been closed, as have the further education colleges.
                Transportation routes in the east of the Province must be
                improved to ensure that those important towns are better
                connected to hospital services and to provide access to further
                education.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I too encourage the provision of green space
                and play facilities in new development. This should be
                concentrated in areas that have suffered from underprovision. We
                must learn from past failures. There are huge areas of towns in
                which planners and developers have been allowed to make money
                simply by building as many houses as they wished. It is
                essential that development should be properly planned and that
                the needs of coming generations are recognised by developers
                through the provision of play areas. We should not beat about
                the bush; such areas should be provided at the start. There is
                no point in leaving them until later, when people who live close
                to an earmarked play area might object. They should be there
                from the start, and planning must provide for them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The plan is not perfect, but it is better
                than what preceded it. On that basis, I am content to see it
                proceed.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister for Regional Development (Mr
                Campbell):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Members for their contributions and
                for the many positive comments on the strategy. I acknowledge
                some of the concerns raised. There were 16 contributions,
                ranging from the price of milk to hospital provision, so Members
                will appreciate the size of my task in dealing with all the
                issues raised.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was some concern for balanced
                development. I heard over and over again that the implementation
                of the strategy would be the most important and relevant
                consideration for the community. I understand that. There were
                queries relating to specific areas, particularly rural ones.
                Concerns about rural proofing, overdevelopment in some areas and
                about the lack of infrastructural development in others were
                also voiced.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The document emphasises the need for balanced
                development. This is not an urban versus rural matter. We have a
                regional strategy for the long-term development of Northern
                Ireland. It provides a framework that goes beyond the land-use
                plans of the past, and it supports the drive towards the
                creation of a dynamic, prosperous and outward-looking Northern
                Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members commented on the lack of
                forward- looking initiative in the document. However, I looked
                briefly over the debate of 2 July and my senior civil servants,
                to whom I pay tribute again, and I have endeavoured to respond
                as positively as we can. It is important that both Members and
                the public are aware that the document is not static. It lays
                down guidelines and a framework and, like Northern Ireland, will
                evolve in the coming years. It is a spatial plan concerned with
                the patterns of development and the scale and nature of
                activities and services to create and sustain communities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members referred to specific
                circumstances, and if I do not respond individually to each one
                now, I will write to those individuals. However, the document is
                a framework for balanced development within which area planning
                and increased local council-led community planning will play
                critical roles. Public policy alone will not deliver the
                strategy, and I take on board Mr Beggs’s comment that,
                particularly due to private-sector investment and individual
                choices, the market will play a key role. Policy can influence
                decisions and choices.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my opening address, I focused on the
                implementation phase. I did not intend to pre-empt the debate
                but to signal that if we are broadly content with the key
                principles of the strategy — and I believe that we are — the
                real task is to get on with that implementation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I looked at the range of consultations
                undertaken since the initial documentation entered the public
                domain. On over 20 occasions, successful efforts were made to
                deal comprehensively with the views, concerns and issues that
                people raised.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The task ahead of implementation is
                challenging, but it is doable. It will require a partnership
                made up of key stakeholders, some of whom are Assembly Members
                just as some are district councillors. They will have an
                important role to play in helping to deliver the strategy. Over
                the next few months, my Department will initiate discussions
                with local council staff to see how we might work on key aspects
                of the regional development strategy with the emerging local
                strategy partnerships.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members referred to the brownfield
                target. I thought that they would; in fact, I would have been
                disappointed had they not referred to it. I must be honest. My
                Department will not be able to deliver that target on its own.
                That is why I have signalled clearly that we will work with the
                development industry in whatever forum is appropriate to meet
                the challenge of achieving that target.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also made the point that through the
                strategy we are attempting to bring coherence and synergy to
                policies that will have an impact on the long-term development
                of the region. The creation of an agreed transportation strategy
                will be critical to our long-term development. Members referred
                to transportation, and I heard references to the A2, the circle
                line, the Knockmore line and Carrick. Obviously, the conference
                at the end of the month will bring us a step forward in
                addressing transportation matters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the autumn, after that conference, the
                draft regional transportation strategy will be published. That

                jigsaw of the regional development strategy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To assure Members of the importance that I
                attach to their contributions I give a commitment that I will
                keep the Assembly updated on progress, as we implement the
                strategy. If Members believe that some issues are not being
                addressed quickly enough, we will see how we can improve that.
                If Members believe that some issues are not being dealt with at
                all, we can look into the reasons for that and endeavour to deal
                with them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to thank Members for the debate today.
                If, after checking Hansard, I see that there are issues that I
                have not dealt with, I will respond in writing. The Magherafelt
                issue that was raised by Rev William McCrea and others springs
                to mind as does the Loughbrickland- Newry Road problem raised by
                Mr Bradley. I will check and write to Members as appropriate.</p>

                Appeals) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2001 (SR 213/2001) be

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to seek the Assembly’s approval for
                a set of regulations that introduces new procedures for
                decisions by the Housing Executive and the Rate Collection
                Agency on claims for housing benefit. These regulations are
                subject to the confirmatory procedure and must be approved by
                the Assembly within six months of their operative date, 2 July
                2001. These regulations were made under powers contained in the
                Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Act (Northern
                Ireland) 2000, which provided for a new decision-making and
                appeals system for housing benefit claims.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The regulations also provide the detailed
                framework for a new decision-making and appeals system with the
                right of appeal to a tribunal, constituted under the Social
                Security (Northern Ireland) Order 1998. There is a further right
                of appeal, on a point of law, to a social security commissioner.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will now explain why reform of the system
                was required. Under the previous system, if a person wished to
                dispute a decision on a housing benefit claim, this was done by
                an initial internal review by the Housing Executive or Rate
                Collection Agency, with the right to a further review by a
                review board. The decision of the review board could only be
                challenged by way of a judicial review. Housing benefit
                claimants did not have the same rights of appeal to the social
                security commissioner or higher courts as social security
                benefit claimants.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore, these regulations bring
                arrangements for decision-making in housing benefit claims into
                line with those applying for all other social security benefits;
                they also bring the arrangements into the mainstream appeal
                system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I now turn to the substance of these
                regulations, which provide for the implementation of the new
                procedures. The regulations closely mirror decision-making
                provisions for other social security benefits administered by my
                Department. They set out the procedures for revising or
                superseding decisions and the procedures to be followed in
                making an appeal. They also provide that the general provisions
                relating to powers and procedures of appeal tribunals, and the
                procedures for making appeals to the commissioners, apply to
                housing benefit appeals. I do not propose to explain the detail
                of each individual regulation, but I am happy to respond to
                Members’ questions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The regulations are beneficial in that the
                same rules for decision-making and appeals will now apply across
                all social security benefits. That will make matters easier for
                claimants to understand, as many claim other social security
                benefits. The regulations will allow the authorities to correct
                mistakes quickly and encourage claimants to make early contact
                to resolve queries and discuss any areas of disagreement. People
                will know how much time they have to ask for a decision to be
                changed, and they will still be able to appeal. These more
                transparent rules are designed to improve the service to
                claimants.</p>

                work was delayed because of the large number of issues that the
                Committee had to deal with before the summer recess. For
                example, we dealt with the Committee’s report on its inquiry
                into the transport used by children travelling to and from
                school, as well as finalising our input to the Department’s

                hopes to be able to complete its work by a much earlier date. I

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Schools have a statutory duty to provide drug
                awareness education to all pupils, throughout their compulsory
                schooling. The topic is included in the curriculum, under the
                cross-curricular theme of health education. In 1996 my
                Department produced a drug education guidance pack for teachers,
                ‘Misuse of Drugs: Guidance for Schools’, in conjunction with
                the education and library boards and the Northern Ireland
                Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment (CCEA).
                Under the Northern Ireland drugs strategy, approximately
                £800,000 was allocated to six projects in the education sector
                in March 2000 to strengthen provision in schools and the youth
                service. Funding will be available until March 2002. No further
                initiatives or changes to the existing drug education programme
                in schools are proposed for the new school year.</p>

                with, and linked to, people who are involved with an
                organisation that spreads illegal drugs across the world? Does
                he not regard that to be a condemnation of himself? Will he take
                the opportunity to condemn, without prevarication, that
                organisation and all its associates?</p>

                countries. I am opposed to drugs, and my party and I have
                campaigned against them. People should be conscious that Sinn
                Féin has been to the forefront of the battle against drugs, not
                just in the North of Ireland but in Dublin and throughout the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The attempt that has been made to link Sinn

                an attempt at cheap political point scoring that bears no
                relation to the truth. We need to recognise that nobody has been

                everything in our power to defeat the drug barons — in Ireland

                the drugs situation in the North of Ireland. The work that we

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Department and I took note of that report,
                and we are very conscious of the need to ensure that we are
                raising standards in all schools. That is one of the key
                objectives. I am advancing a range of initiatives with this aim
                firmly in sight. They include massive capital investment in
                schools, and the school improvement programme, which is designed
                to raise standards in all schools by addressing literacy and
                numeracy, discipline, target-setting, school development
                planning and low achievement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a pilot initiative to provide
                flexibility for an increased focus on work-related learning at
                Key Stage 4, and investment in information and communication
                technology as well as ongoing work to maintain and enhance the
                quality of teaching. Action is being taken to address the
                educational needs of pupils who are at risk of exclusion from
                school, and a range of programmes offer alternative education
                for pupils who have become disaffected from mainstream
                education.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The expansion of pre-school education is
                another very important dimension, as is the reduction of class
                sizes for four-year-olds to eight-year-olds. Other measures
                include the abolition of school performance tables and the three
                major reviews of key aspects of our education system — the
                post-primary review, the curriculum review and the consultation
                on the local management of schools commonality.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I take the point that has been made. Efforts
                are being made in the Department to tackle what is undoubtedly a
                big problem. However, as politicians, we need to recognise our
                responsibility to get this right and to provide the proper
                backdrop to ending social deprivation and increasing employment
                prospects. All Members can contribute to the improvement in
                education standards by continuing to contribute to the success
                of the peace process, the full implementation of the Good Friday
                Agreement and the provision of essential political stability.
                These gains are required to give hope to everyone in our society
                in their dealings with their children, so that they can impress
                on children the need to have a good education in a secure and
                caring environment.</p>

                improving standards, especially in primary schools. The Member

                about 30 days. The CCEA alone sets a much tighter target of 15

                provide home-to-school transport in accordance with the approved

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M McGuinness:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned about the situation in north
                Belfast. The Department of Education is keeping the situation
                under review and working with the school authorities — the
                Belfast Education and Library Board, the Council for Catholic
                Maintained Schools (CCMS), the principals and the boards of
                governors — to deal with the difficulties that exist. However,
                it is vital that everybody, particularly Members, appreciate
                that the responsibility to relieve the burden on the school
                authorities, parents and children rests with the area’s
                elected representatives and community leaders.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Everyone must recognise that if a problem is
                created or exists outside of the school yard or the school
                buildings — whether it be in north Belfast or elsewhere —
                there is a duty and a responsibility on everybody in society to
                pull together to address that as a matter of urgency.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The situation affects everybody. It affects
                Nationalist, Republican, Unionist, Catholic and Protestant
                children. The latest débâcle on the Ardoyne Road concerning
                Holy Cross Girls’ Primary School has shown that it is not only
                the children in that school who are affected, but the children
                at Wheatfield Primary School. The House must take account of
                that when fulfilling its responsibilites to resolve those
                difficulties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The story that went around the world during
                that very bad week on the Ardoyne Road was shameful. It did no
                one any good, and it was an embarassment to us all. Members —
                as elected representatives — must understand and appreciate
                that they have a duty and a responsibility to do everything in
                their power to ensure that society moves in a co-operative
                fashion and that children can get to school without fear of
                threat, intimidation or abuse.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister agree that the right to
                attend school in safety should be afforded to all children,
                particularly those from Holy Cross Girls’ Primary School in
                Ardoyne?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M McGuinness:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The right to get to school safely is a right
                that all children have; it does not matter where they come from.
                However, a particular situation exists at Holy Cross Girls’
                Primary School.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I stated previously, all children should
                be able to travel to school unhindered and be educated in an
                environment where they feel secure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The protest at Holy Cross Primary School
                should stop; that is the sensible way forward. The issues need
                to be addressed by the local community and the elected
                representatives not by targeting innocent school children. We
                have to realise that this is a bad-news story for everyone. It
                is particularly difficult for parents of children who live in
                that part of north Belfast. It does not matter what side of the
                community they are from.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Everyone was shocked and horrified by reports
                from a GP in the area about young children who were on
                medication and about some who were bedwetting. If that does not
                bring home to us the great responsibility we have to ensure that
                every child, no matter what section of the community they come
                from, has the right to travel to school without fear, then I do
                not know what will.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate the problems and the
                difficulties. We are hopeful that the point of contact
                established between the Executive and the people in the local
                community, alongside ongoing work on the ground, can bring about
                a successful resolution of the problems that affect the people
                of that area.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The teaching staff at Holy Cross Primary
                School led by Anne Tanney, who has proven to be a first-class
                principal, and supported by Fr Aidan Troy, have had a huge
                amount of work to do in providing education for children over
                this difficult period.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Within the schools authorities, the boards of
                governors and our schools, we can see many people — who I have
                often described at prize-givings and meetings I have attended
                — who are the heroes and heroines of our education system, no
                matter what section of our community they come from. This has
                been a particularly difficult period for all of them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At departmental level, we have worked with
                the schools authorities, the Belfast Education and Library Board
                and the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools (CCMS). We have
                met with the principals and assured them that the resources
                required to take us through this period will be provided.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have substantial numbers of people here

                their mother tongue. We have an increasing number of people who
                are legitimate refugees and asylum seekers in Northern Ireland.
                Is it therefore not incumbent upon the Department to make better
                arrangements for people who come from those ethnic minorities so
                that they can take languages other than English as their choice

                I am sure that it would be possible, although I cannot answer
                for the Eastern Board today. As part of the framework for
                action, people have been asked to look at instances where it is
                possible to have operations carried out at another hospital

                emergency departments because they cannot cope. Urology patients
                and those waiting for angiograms and magnetic resonance imaging
                (MRI) scans in the Craigavon area must now wait for up to three

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can the Minister now give us something to
                look forward to, and explain the unacceptable growth of the
                waiting lists?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms de Brún:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are many good examples of what is being
                done. Given the pressures on the service, had that work not been
                carried out, the situation would be a good deal more serious.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many hundreds have been offered the
                opportunity of undergoing their operation at a different
                hospital, if they have been waiting a long time. For example,
                the Eastern Board has recently offered 300 patients the
                opportunity to be treated at Downe Hospital, rather than wait
                for their operation elsewhere. A further six ophthalmology
                patients have been treated as day cases in the Mater Hospital
                — they would otherwise have had to wait for treatment
                elsewhere. Ward 8 in the Royal Victoria Hospital has been
                reorganised as an elective ward for six months a year, and as an
                emergency admissions ward for the rest of the year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several pilot studies have been carried out.
                For example, a study at the Royal Victoria Hospital is aimed at
                finding ways to reduce waiting times for oral surgery. Other
                patients have travelled to Glasgow to have cardiac surgery,
                rather than wait for treatment locally. As the Member so kindly
                pointed out during her question on scanning, a mobile MRI unit
                was brought in to provide a scanning service for the Northern
                Board and Western Board areas to help reduce waiting lists
                there. Additional scanning capacity from a mobile unit also
                continues at the Royal Victoria Hospital.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Waiting lists have grown for two reasons.
                First, the overall capacity of the system: in spite of the
                funding that I have allocated for the reduction of waiting lists
                — which the Member highlighted — more investment in the
                service is needed if it is to meet the demands being placed on
                it. The additional resources allocated in this year’s budget
                fall far short of the bids that I made.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The increase in the inpatient waiting list in
                the last quarter can, for the large part, be explained by delays
                in some operations resulting from the directive to use
                single-use instruments for tonsillectomies. Around 60% of the
                increase in waiting lists occurred in the ear, nose and throat
                speciality. Other issues were involved, and I can come back to
                them if Members want more detail on the specific figures for the
                last quarter.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr McDonnell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is the Minister aware that people awaiting
                hip replacements, which in some cases could have been done in a
                couple of months two years ago, are now having to wait more than
                two years? Furthermore, people awaiting coronary artery bypass
                grafts cannot even get on a waiting list. Much of the
                flexibility and options for shopping around that she referred to
                earlier are no longer permitted. Those are some of the
                difficulties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many other GPs and I want to know what to
                tell those patients and their relations. One lady said to me
                that, as far as she was concerned, the Health Service is leaving
                her husband, who has coronary artery disease, to die.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms de Brún:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware that the rise in waiting lists
                means that some people are having to wait longer for their
                much-needed treatment. As I said in answer to a previous
                question, it is clear that clinical priorities are being dealt
                with. However, it is worth remembering that three out of four
                people waiting for either inpatient treatment or outpatient
                appointments are still being seen within three months.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Specifically regarding cardiac surgery, I am
                very conscious of the difficulties. For that reason I have asked
                the Chief Medical Officer to carry out an urgent review of that
                area. She has examined it and has made several recommendations.
                I hope to issue the review report in the near future. I have
                also allocated additional funding for supernumerary posts in
                cardiac intensive care to support existing staff, allowing
                additional nurses to give specialised treatment. That will help
                to increase bed capacity and the number of operations. Some
                people who have been waiting longer have been offered surgery
                elsewhere. Angiographic facilities due to open at Altnagelvin
                Hospital will increase overall capacity for this diagnostic
                facility and testing and will help to reduce waiting time.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. What
                additional finance is needed to resolve the matter, given that a
                similar situation exists in the UK? The Labour Government have
                had to inject massive resources into that.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms de Brún:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Money is specifically put into waiting list
                initiatives, and money is also put into the service as a whole.
                Clearly, regardless of the amount of money put into waiting list
                intiatives, if the service is under considerable pressure we
                will see a rise in waiting lists rather than the fall we would
                like to see. The service has faced some very difficult choices
                this year. To make a lasting impact on waiting lists we must
                address the capacity in hospital and community services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have given an extra £3 million for action
                on waiting lists this year. In addition, last year’s normal
                allocation of £5 million was made recurrent, bringing the total
                additional resources specifically for action on waiting lists
                this year to £8 million. However, in the Eastern Board area
                alone, medical activity in hospitals is calculated to have
                increased by almost 9% since last year. Our hospitals are
                generally operating with occupancy levels in excess of 80%. When
                that kind of capacity difficulty exists, any increase in the
                number of emergency admissions or the loss of capacity on a
                given day can increase pressure considerably. On some days
                occupancy levels are well in excess of 90%. The system is
                running so close to full capacity that any small increase in
                demand can be a problem. I as Minister, and the Assembly as a
                whole, need to address that budget in the coming period.</p>

                three years, £5·5 million has been spent on tackling drug
                misuse. In the most recent Budget, the Chancellor allocated an

                read out? I know that the drugs issue is embarrassing for the
                Minister and her party. However, I trust that we will not see
                the same political monkey act that we had from her Colleague,
                the Minister of Education. He seemed to see no evil, hear no
                evil and did not believe that his party did any evil in relation
                to drug dealing and other drug-related activity in Northern

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister unequivocally condemn the

                executive member and the IRA/Sinn Féin foreign representative
                who were caught with drug-dealing terrorists in Colombia? Given
                that she is so concerned about the drug problem in Northern
                Ireland, what co-operation has she given to the RUC in its
                efforts to defeat it?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member knows that questions about the
                supply of drugs are not within my remit. However, to be helpful
                to him, I approached the NIO for information about the sources
                of drug supply, and I have given him the answer that my
                officials received.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, I can only presume that the Member
                is referring to the three Irish men recently arrested in
                Colombia. I would certainly not refer to people in the way in
                which he did. Thirdly, Sinn Féin — as the Member well knows
                — is not involved in drug trafficking, nor is it associated
                with any organisations that are. My party’s position on drug
                trafficking is clear, and it is absolutely and entirely
                consistent with my considerable efforts, as Minister, to
                implement the drug strategy and to combat drug abuse.</p>

                the Member knows, I am working with the new structures and the
                six working groups on the joint implementation of the drug and
                alcohol strategies, as agreed and supported by the Executive.</p>

                four of the six working groups and on the drug and alcohol
                implementation steering group. The Executive and I feel that the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Good progress has been made since the launch
                of the drugs strategy in August 1999. Four drug and alcohol
                co-ordination teams are now in place, with representatives from
                the agencies working in the field. Each of those teams has
                produced, and is putting into effect, an action plan that
                reflects circumstances and priorities in their respective areas.
                Therefore, there is an action plan designed to help tackle the
                problems that are specific to the Member’s area. The key
                Departments and agencies have also produced, and are
                implementing, plans for action at the regional level across
                their various responsibilities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member will also know of the work being
                done by the Drug Information and Research Unit (DIRU). As heroin
                addiction is such a difficult problem, treatment is mainly
                provided through local community addiction teams. There are
                eight teams, which offer a variety of treatment services at
                their clinics. Each team has a consultant psychiatrist who will
                see the individual concerned after a member of the community
                addiction team has made an initial assessment. A treatment
                programme is then agreed on, which can range from residential
                treatment and detoxification in the community to the
                prescription of substitutes in exceptional circumstances.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The additional resource package, worth £4·5
                million, was used to pay for the 10-bed inpatient unit that was
                recently opened at Holywell Hospital. That means better
                residential and detoxification facilities for the Ballymena
                area.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister clarify her budget? What is
                the total annual budget this year to deal with the issue of drug
                abuse? Could she provide me with details of the 36 projects in
                writing? Are certain areas in Northern Ireland being targeted,
                especially those with a known history of cocaine abuse?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms de Brún:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There have been two main sources of money
                specifically to deal with the drug issue. People who come into
                an accident and emergency unit and are suffering from drug and
                alcohol abuse will get treatment that is not paid for from that
                budget. Those people might be seen by a consultant psychiatrist
                or by other staff for different difficulties. In 1999, £5·5
                million was made available to implement the drugs strategy, and
                £4·5 million of that was allocated to the 36 projects. I am
                happy to send the Member the information he requested.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This year, in addition to the £5·5 million,
                we had an extra £9 million from the Chancellor’s Budget. To
                date, £6·23 million of that money has been transferred into
                the Executive Budget. Discussions are now under way to determine
                how to deploy these resources most effectively within our remit.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are making considerable progress in
                implementing the strategy and in tackling the problem. An
                extensive range of work must be carried out. We have ensured
                that work has been organised across the spectrum of society.
                Therefore, in the new working groups, work is being advanced
                that involves treatment, education and prevention, information
                and research, local communities and social legislation. The NIO
                will carry out work in the criminal justice field.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Not only do we have a range of projects in
                place that impact keenly on the issue, but structures have been
                formed that can impact on the problem and that are a model of
                inclusiveness. They allow for the voluntary and community
                sectors to have more than 20 seats throughout the structure,
                which will also help to impact on the measures that are needed
                to advance the strategy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Work is being carried out in the education
                and treatment fields, and specifically, as the drug strategy
                suggested, in dealings with young people and in the field of
                peer education. Work is being also carried out — successfully
                — in communities.</p>

                treoir úr ar bith ar úsáid beta interferon.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware that the draft recommendations
                issued recently by the National Institute for Clinical
                Excellence (NICE) have given rise to considerable concern about
                the future availability of beta interferon. I have already met
                with the Multiple Sclerosis Society to listen to its views and,
                more recently, I have met with health professionals who are also
                involved in the management of multiple sclerosis. The document
                that NICE issued recently represents a provisional appraisal of
                four medicines used in the management of multiple sclerosis. It
                is a consultation document only and, at this stage, does not
                constitute fresh guidance on the use of beta interferon.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Members may be aware, NICE guidance
                applies only in England and Wales. However, I may wish to
                consider local implications when the guidance is formerly
                published later this year. In the meantime, patients with
                multiple sclerosis will continue to receive drugs such as beta
                interferon for as long as their consultant neurologist considers
                that they are likely to benefit from the treatment — having
                discussed the risks and benefits of treatment with the patient,
                and having taken account of the evidence of effectiveness,
                departmental guidance and the guidelines of the Association of
                British Neurologists.</p>

                will provide some reassurance to those who are currently
                receiving beta interferon and who are concerned that the

                be implemented here.</p>

                that the earliest likely date for the publication of the NICE
                guidelines is November 2001. It is appropriate that the

                of multiple sclerosis, including new and emerging evidence on
                both the clinical and cost-effectiveness of these medicines. The

                memorandum of reply conveys the response of the relevant
                Department to the PAC’s conclusions. I have seen both the
                Committee’s conclusion and the Department’s reply. As I read
                it, there was a difference of opinion over a course of action
                that had taken place over several years. The Committee was of
                the view that the Department had not acted swiftly enough to
                resolve a particular issue, while both the accounting officer
                and the departmental Minister considered that the action had
                been as swift as possible. I would find it difficult to
                second-guess another Minister in relation to whether a
                Department had acted quickly enough in a complex situation.
                However, I am sure that the Department concerned is well aware

                with an open and transparent process. However, I also accept
                that it might be more appropriate for a Department not to baldly
                reject the PAC’s view, and the Department of Finance and

                proposed to me by the Speaker before he left the Chair. The
                Civil Service review will take account of targeting social need,
                equal opportunities and regional planning strategy. Will the
                Minister confirm that it will take into account, as it states in
                the Programme for Government, the need for rural proofing, and
                when can we expect to see some practical changes from the review
                regarding decentralisation to the rural community? Can he ensure

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I expect to receive the consultants’ report
                by the end of November, at which stage the scope for the
                decentralisation of Civil Service jobs will become clear, as
                should the level of resources required to deliver any
                decentralisation options. Where options for decentralisation are
                identified, the impact on the exporting and importing areas,
                urban or rural, will have to be considered. I intend to examine
                any options and the associated financial implications as a
                matter of urgency, together with Colleagues on the Executive,
                and in appropriate consultation with other interested parties.
                It is too early to say what resources might be required or to
                identify how they might be secured.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister agree that decentralisation
                of public-sector employment does not mean a redeployment to two
                or three urban centres across Northern Ireland? When the
                Minister for Regional Development spoke about decentralisation a
                few days ago he said that roads, water, planning and other
                services were in place across the rural community. That is
                contradicted by the experience in south-east Ulster, where
                planning, roads, water, sewerage, land valuation and rate
                collection, among other functions, are centralised in
                Marlborough House in Craigavon. Will he give specific attention
                to that?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By definition, the examination of the scope
                for decentralisation will concentrate on the potential for jobs
                to be relocated from Belfast and north Down. One factor that
                must be taken into account in deciding where such jobs might go
                is the number of Civil Service jobs in any one area in relation
                to the local workforce.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remind the Minister that as well as the
                issue of where jobs might be taken to, with the consequent
                benefits for the receiving areas, there is also a severe problem
                with office accommodation in the Greater Belfast/north Down
                area. That is particularly true for organisations such as the
                Environment and Heritage Service, whose premises, I understand,
                are already overcrowded, yet it is supposedly recruiting
                additional staff. How quickly does the Minister expect to be
                able to do anything about those pressures, given the long
                timescale under which jobs will be decentralised?</p>

                already suffering acute accommodation pressures as a result of
                departmental reorganisation and accommodation constraints, not
                least those that the Member has referred to in the Greater
                Belfast area. Notwithstanding the strategic importance of the
                review that I have referred to, we are also considering
                shorter-term measures that can relieve some of the pressures
                currently facing Departments.</p>

                authorisation of expenditure of £9 million on accommodation in
                east Belfast, will he give the House some assurance that civil
                servants’ jobs, perhaps under pressure for accommodation, will

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must correct the Member. I did not give
                approval for the Assembly Commission to spend £9 million on
                accommodation in east Belfast. Expenditure by the Assembly
                Commission is not subject to the approval of the Minister of
                Finance and Personnel or the Executive. The Member should know
                that, and she should have read her correspondence carefully.
                That expenditure is undertaken by the Assembly Commission, on
                which a range of parties are represented. I understand that the
                Assembly Commission’s decision was unanimous.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last month, I met with representatives of the
                Quarry Products Association. They expressed concerns about the
                impact of the aggregates levy. My office is currently liaising
                with the Financial Secretary’s office in the Treasury to
                arrange a meeting to discuss the adverse impact of the levy in
                Northern Ireland. Discussions between the Treasury and the
                Northern Ireland Administration continue at an official level,
                and the Northern Ireland Departments continue to liaise with
                each other on this important matter.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s answer and his
                comments on an issue that is particularly important to people in
                the North. The drafters have overlooked an inherent flaw in the
                legislation. Will the Minister comment on the fact that jobs and
                products will migrate south of the border from Fermanagh and
                Tyrone, making this legislation impossible to implement?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have no wish to offer any arguments against
                some of the observations the Member has made. As a regional
                administration we are making the case that this tax does not
                meet the basic test of good taxation. Several factors applying
                to this region have not been properly taken into account, which
                means that this tax will have an adverse economic impact and a
                potentially perverse environmental impact.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister accept that if this tax
                were to be implemented in the way currently being proposed, many
                quarries and quarry product manufacturers along the border could
                go out of business in the same way as the petrol filling
                stations have done over the past three or four years? Does he
                have a view on the recent comments of the European Commission
                official who said that he would like to see the United Kingdom
                reduce taxes that greatly distort trade along land borders?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Administration are aware that the impact
                of the tax is not going to be useful or helpful. It will bear
                down particularly heavily on areas close to the border. That is
                an issue that we will continue to try to make clear to the
                Treasury. If there are any other counsels that can prevail with
                the Treasury, we would be happy to see them do so.</p>

                leases and connected transactions within the Harbour Estate and
                the extent to which they have served the public interest.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the opportunity to address the
                Assembly in what I consider is an important debate on the
                Regional Development Committee’s report on the Titanic Quarter
                leases. Let me say from the outset that this is a timely
                reminder of the need for public or semi-public bodies to be
                sensitive to public interest and, particularly, to the need for
                transparency in their business activities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to take this opportunity to
                thank all those who gave evidence to the Committee for Regional
                Development during the course of its inquiry. In particular, I
                thank officials from the Department for Regional Development,
                the Belfast Harbour Commissioners and Harland &amp; Wolff for
                their co-operation throughout. The Committee also received
                written submissions from interested bodies, for which it is
                grateful.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before I outline the Committee’s key
                findings, I will explain briefly why it considered this inquiry
                necessary. Following the announcement on 7 February 2001 by
                Harland &amp; Wolff that Harland &amp; Wolff Properties Ltd and
                Titanic Quarter Ltd had been purchased by Fred Olsen Energy, the
                Committee for Regional Development wrote to the Belfast Harbour
                Commissioners registering its concern about the lease
                arrangements. On 20 March an Ulster Television ‘Insight’
                programme made several allegations about a secret deal being
                struck between the Belfast Harbour Commissioners and Harland
                &amp; Wolff. The Committee for Regional Development viewed these
                allegations very seriously. As a result, I, as Chairperson,
                wrote to the Harbour Commissioners seeking clarification on a
                number of points, in particular on the terms of this agreement
                and what additional revenue would be received by the Harbour
                Commissioners, who strenuously refuted the allegations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Despite receiving some correspondence from
                the Harbour Commissioners, some important questions remained
                unanswered. As a consequence, and given the continued
                uncertainty around this matter, the Committee formally announced
                on 3 April 2001 that it would hold an inquiry into the
                circumstances surrounding the signing of the Titanic Quarter
                development agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the record, the intention to hold this
                inquiry was agreed unanimously by the Committee for Regional
                Development. Members recognised the social and economic
                importance of the Port of Belfast to all people in Northern
                Ireland. Members were also reminded that the Port of Belfast is
                publicly-owned land and that the Harbour Commissioners, as
                public appointees, are entrusted with the stewardship of the
                port and its lands to promote the maintenance, improvement and
                efficient operation of Belfast harbour. The Assembly, therefore,
                has a clear duty to safeguard the public interest and, in turn,
                expects those entrusted with the management of Belfast port to
                ensure public accountability and transparency in any
                transactions involving its future development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will now summarise the key findings of the
                Committee’s inquiry into the Titanic Quarter leases. On the
                public availability of Titanic Quarter development plans, and
                based on the evidence provided to the Committee, the Committee
                concluded that all key facts about the negotiations and signing
                of the Titanic Quarter agreement were not in the public domain.
                While giving evidence to the Committee, an official from the
                Department for Regional Development stated that the Department
                was not aware of all the details, including the signing of the
                agreement on 20 December 2000. The Department was not aware that
                the agreement involved the consolidation of several leases into
                one and that leases would be allocated to developers on a
                site-by-site basis for periods of between 125 and 250 years. The
                Department had been informed that negotiations had been classed
                as commercial in confidence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee was also concerned that,
                despite an approach from the Department to the Harbour
                Commissioners on 7 February 2001 with regard to the details of
                the agreement, the Harbour Commissioners were somewhat dilatory
                in responding to the Department’s request, taking
                approximately five weeks to do so.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It appears from the available evidence that
                the Belfast Harbour Commissioners became aware of their public
                accountability responsibilities only when the UTV ‘Insight’
                programme was broadcast. The Committee for Regional Development
                concluded that had it not been for that television programme,
                the Belfast Harbour Commissioners might not have been so
                forthcoming in informing public representatives of their
                activities relating to the Titanic Quarter agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the inquiry, the Committee learned
                that while Belfast Harbour Commissioners and Harland &amp; Wolff
                were negotiating the Titanic Quarter lease, the commissioners
                were also in discussion with the Department for Regional
                Development about a memorandum of understanding. The purpose of
                that memorandum was to provide the Department with greater
                involvement and consultation in any new leases or disposal of
                lands in the Belfast port, pending the introduction of the power
                of direction relating to the development of such lands.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several key areas, including the Titanic
                Quarter, were excluded from the memorandum. There was a
                difference of opinion between the Department and the Belfast
                Harbour Commissioners as to who had requested those exclusions.
                After careful consideration of the evidence, the Committee
                concluded that it could not see any benefit for the Department
                in its requesting exclusions from the memorandum of
                understanding. The purpose of the agreement was to facilitate
                the Department’s monitoring of the Belfast Harbour
                Commissioners’ activities in areas of major public interest,
                such as the Titanic Quarter. The Committee therefore concluded
                that the Belfast Harbour Commissioners could have been more open
                in their dealings and could have displayed greater public
                accountability.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In their evidence to the Committee for
                Regional Development, the Belfast Harbour Commissioners quoted
                commercial confidentiality as the reason why they did not inform
                the Department about the Titanic Quarter deal. They stated that
                Harland &amp; Wolff had requested confidentiality. That, the
                commissioners stated, was a key factor in the amount of
                information that they made available.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Belfast Harbour Commissioners confirmed
                Harland &amp; Wolff’s request for confidentiality in a letter
                dated 26 March 2001 to myself as Chairperson of the Committee
                for Regional Development. The commissioners also informed the
                Minister for Regional Development of Harland &amp; Wolff’s
                request at a meeting on 22 March 2001.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, Harland &amp; Wolff stated that it
                was not opposed to making a public statement after the signing
                of the deal on 20 December 2000. Its representatives explained
                that there had been no pre-determined or conscious effort by
                Harland &amp; Wolff to keep the details of the deal secret. To
                Harland &amp; Wolff, the Titanic Quarter deal was primarily
                about enabling it to continue with its core business of
                shipbuilding. At the signing of the agreement, Harland &amp;
                Wolff acknowledged that its representative had casually
                mentioned that he did not think that a press release was needed.
                The Belfast Harbour Commissioners agreed with that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As further evidence to support its claims of
                not being involved in a secret deal, Harland &amp; Wolff
                highlighted the statement by Fred Olsen Energy ASA to the Oslo
                Stock Exchange on 31 January 2001, which openly referred to the
                Titanic Quarter deal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee for Regional Development
                accepts that it is possible that the Belfast Harbour
                Commissioners might have misconstrued the comments of Harland
                &amp; Wolff’s representative at the meeting on 20 December
                2001. However, the Committee believes that the Belfast Harbour
                Commissioners should have been proactive in seeking to publicise
                the deal in the interests of public openness and accountability,
                as well as the significant potential benefits that the deal
                would bring to the Northern Ireland economy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that the Assembly
                acknowledges the good work that the Belfast Harbour
                Commissioners have done over the years to ensure the commercial
                viability of the Port of Belfast, continually seeking to improve
                performance and profitability. I would not like anything that I
                say to take away from that achievement. I speak for everyone by
                recognising the economic importance of Belfast port and its
                lands to all the people of Northern Ireland. Apart from European
                funding, the Port of Belfast has never received public finance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee’s concerns have focused on
                the level of public accountability of the Titanic Quarter
                transactions. It has not questioned the Belfast Harbour
                Commissioners’ ability to manage a profitable and commercially
                viable port. However, the Committee and the Assembly are anxious
                to ensure that those entrusted with such a large public asset
                are aware of their need to consult all those with an interest in
                how that public asset is managed and developed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the time it has taken to bring this
                report to the Assembly, I am aware that a memorandum of
                understanding has been signed between the Department for
                Regional Development and the Belfast Harbour Commissioners. The
                commissioners have voluntarily and willingly signed this
                agreement, which now includes the Titanic Quarter area. This
                memorandum of understanding will ensure increased public
                accountability and scrutiny. The other recommendations of the
                Committee are to be implemented, and I am assured that similar
                problems can be avoided in the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important to bring this to Members’
                attention. In paragraph 52 of the report it says:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Committee acknowledges that
                devolution has afforded locally elected representatives
                increased opportunities to examine more carefully those tasked
                with safeguarding the public interest. In many ways this process
                is at an embryonic stage, whereby many are still adapting to the
                more direct involvement of the Government and the Assembly and
                the increased scrutiny and accountability which this inevitably
                brings to the decision making process. Indeed this increased
                accountability goes to the heart of this inquiry. However there
                appears to still exist a perception among many within key public
                appointments that given their breadth of experience, knowledge
                and expertise in a particular area, they are best placed to
                protect the public interest without reference to the
                democratically elected representatives or institutions.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In many ways, that sums up what this report
                is about, and I commend it to the Assembly. This inquiry has
                served an important public purpose, which is to sensitise those
                in public roles and in the public sector to the need for
                accountability and transparency.</p>

                Regional Development (Mr McFarland):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for Regional
                Development has ably covered the key points in the report. The
                inquiry has cleared the air and improved relations between the
                Department, the Port of Belfast and the Assembly Committee. The
                report shows that Committees can be effective watchdogs. There
                is evidence, and not just from this inquiry, that some
                Departments and public bodies are using the commercial in
                confidence label to hide detail from public gaze.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The message that should be sent as a result
                of this report is that any public organisation, or any
                organisation receiving public funds, can expect enquiry into its
                affairs by the public representatives in the Assembly who have a
                responsibility to protect the public interest. Hiding behind the
                commercial in confidence label, except where it is legitimate so
                to do, should not be an option. I too commend the report to the
                Assembly.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hay:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is difficult to know where to start with
                this debate. I agree with the Chairperson of the Committee for
                Regional Development that the Port of Belfast has been a success
                story. It is important that we, as public representatives,
                acknowledge that success and congratulate the people involved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Port of Belfast has been widely debated
                for years, as have many of the issues surrounding it. As long
                ago as 1997 we had reports from the Minister then responsible,
                Lord Dubs, on its privatisation. After devolution, on 29
                November 1999, the Committee for Regional Development was given
                the task of looking at various matters in connection with the
                port. There were several options, and it is no secret that the
                Committee was heavily in favour of option D. This recommended
                the retention of the Port of Belfast as a trust port with
                extended powers. The Committee Chairperson referred to the
                memorandum of understanding, which is included in that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee became annoyed, to put it
                mildly, that, despite the memorandum of understanding having
                been discussed between the Belfast Harbour Commissioners and the
                Department for Regional Development, three weeks prior to the
                publication of its findings on the future of the port Harland
                &amp; Wolff announced on 7 February 2001 that Harland &amp;
                Wolff Properties Ltd had been bought by Fred Olsen Energy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That created major problems for the Committee
                as well as for the Department and the Minister. The Committee
                wrote to the Harbour Commissioners registering its concern about
                the lease arrangements and requesting additional information on
                the announcement, because there had been a major shift on what
                had been agreed to concerning the leases and lease agreements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Titanic Quarter is an important development
                for Belfast and for the future structure and investment of the
                Port of Belfast, but it is also important for the future
                economic life of Northern Ireland as a whole, and that should be
                said publicly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem was that the Committee found it
                difficult to get answers to several questions. For example, why
                did it take almost five weeks for the Harbour Commissioners to
                give us the relevant information? We found it difficult to get
                the commissioners to clarify some points, and even the
                Department found it difficult to get to the nub of the
                situation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was only after an Ulster Television (UTV)
                programme, on 20 March, that a fire was lit under the Belfast
                Harbour Commissioners. Had that programme not been screened, we
                would not have got the response that we needed from them. After
                the programme, a mountain of information came to the Department,
                the Minister and the Committee. The UTV programme certainly made
                the Harbour Commissioners more aware of their public
                responsibilities and accountability.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a tragedy that it took a UTV programme
                for the Committee members to get answers to the questions that
                we had been asking for five weeks. After the programme, the
                commissioners sought meetings with the Committee and with the
                Minister to reassure us all that everything that they had done
                was out in the open and that they had nothing to hide. Had the
                Committee got a response to its points much sooner, it would not
                have considered the situation to be as serious as it did.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given those circumstances, it was right that
                the Committee decided to hold its inquiry. At the outset of that
                inquiry, the Chairperson was correct to say that it was not a
                witch-hunt, nor were the Belfast Harbour Commissioners or the
                Department on trial. The inquiry tried to get to the nub of the
                situation and of the secrecy surrounding the decision to develop
                the Titanic Quarter. It sought to find out why the Belfast
                Harbour Commissioners, and Harland &amp; Wolff, did not keep the
                Minister informed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson referred to the issue
                of commercial confidence. However, when such a change affecting
                the lands at Titanic Quarter was being mooted, and when the
                commissioners knew that serious changes were to be made to the
                leases, they should at least have informed the Minister
                privately as to what they might be signing. Those were the
                issues of concern to the Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have all learned lessons from this. The
                Belfast Harbour Commissioners certainly realise that the
                Assembly and the Committee for Regional Development have laid
                down a marker. Irrespective of whether they felt, even after the
                signing on 20 December, that they could not say anything
                publicly about the matter, the Committee felt that the reasons
                given by the commissioners for not putting information into the
                public domain were not justified.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope, now that the memorandum of
                understanding between the Harbour Commissioners and the
                Department has been signed, that we will all move on from here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Port of Belfast has a huge part to play
                in the economic life of the city and of Northern Ireland as a
                whole. As members of the Regional Development Committee, as
                Assembly Members, and as public representatives, all we want is
                to make sure that the Port of Belfast succeeds in the future. I
                hope that we have all learned lessons from something that could
                have been avoided had there been greater accountability from
                people who should have known better.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McNamee:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
                The Committee report is comprehensive, and the Chairperson has
                outlined the essential issues and the sequence of events that
                gave the Committee cause for concern when it called for the
                inquiry and during the evidence sessions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Belfast port is a trust port, as are most of
                those in the North. Belfast Harbour Commissioners, as the port
                authority, are required to ensure the maintenance and effective
                operation of the Port of Belfast and to ensure that it is
                managed in the best interests of the public and other
                stakeholders.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The ports are an essential asset; they
                facilitate economic development in the entire region, and are
                therefore of significant public interest. However, as they are
                currently constituted, trust ports are not accountable to
                Government; they are autonomous. Therein lies the problem —
                bodies that exist to serve the public interest are not
                accountable to the public or to the Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Regional Development Committee was tasked
                in November 1999 to look at the options for the future of
                Belfast port and others. It gave its response to the Minister at
                the end of February 2001. The Committee met several times with
                officials from the Department, the Minister and representatives
                from the Belfast Harbour Commissioners. The subject of
                discussion on those occasions was the future operation of the
                ports. In regard to the Port of Belfast, discussions focused on
                the potential use and development of non-port land and the means
                of ensuring its future viability and competitiveness.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposed memorandum of understanding
                between the Department and the Belfast Harbour Commissioners
                also formed part of the discussions, as did legislation that
                would enable the Department to direct the Belfast Harbour
                Commissioners in future business decisions in regard to the
                port.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the discussions concerning the future
                of non-port lands, the Department for Regional Development —
                and therefore the Minister — and the Committee were not aware
                of the detail of agreement in relation to the future leases of
                the non-port land of Belfast port. We were discussing the future
                of the port while unbeknown to us arrangements were being made
                that would have a significant impact on the future use of
                non-port land.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That was not an example of accountability or
                transparency, in spite of the fact that Belfast Harbour
                Commissioners claimed to have fully informed the Department for
                Regional Development about the planned development of the
                Titanic Quarter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I therefore commend the report’s
                recommendations, particularly the recommendation that
                legislation be fast-tracked to give the Department the power of
                direction over key business activities of Belfast port.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend the memorandum of understanding,
                which will outline the responsibilities of each port authority
                and its accountability to the Department. I also commend the
                increased number of local representatives on harbour
                authorities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report’s recommendations will ensure
                that the trust ports will remain viable and competitive. It will
                also ensure that the authorities are publicly accountable and
                that the ports are managed and operated in such a way that they
                serve the public interest. Go raibh maith agat.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Neeson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not a member of the Committee for
                Regional Development, but I was a member of the Ad Hoc Committee
                that the Assembly established to deal with the privatisation.
                For many years, I have taken a deep interest in the operation of
                the Port of Belfast and other ports in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I share the concerns about the lack of
                openness in the way in which deals were done. However, I welcome
                the fact that there is now a memorandum of understanding between
                the commissioners and the Department for Regional Development. I
                also welcome the proposal that four locally elected
                representatives should serve on the board and that a
                representative from the Department for Regional Development will
                attend the board meetings.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Despite our reservations about the way in
                which the deal was done, we must look forward. The Titanic
                Quarter is one of the prime waterfront locations of Europe. I
                echo what William Hay said: it is of major significance to
                Belfast and the whole of Northern Ireland. We must acknowledge
                that when we consider the development of the site. There are
                many interested parties that must be involved in the development
                of the site. They include the Belfast Harbour Commissioners,
                Harland &amp; Wolff — through Titanic Quarter Ltd — Belfast
                City Council, the Laganside Corporation, the Department for
                Regional Development, the Department of the Environment and
                others.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members know that I have spoken with
                enthusiasm about the idea that Belfast should be the European
                City of Culture in 2008. The Titanic Quarter provides major
                opportunities to create the sort of developments that would
                reflect the city’s position. Various draft development plans
                have been put forward over the years. We must get it right. The
                area should be developed as a major tourist and cultural
                location for Northern Ireland — from the Odyssey Arena to the
                slipways where the Titanic was built.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is significant international interest
                in the development of the site. I remind Members of the impact
                of, for example, the development of the Guggenheim Museum in
                Bilbao. That city was facing serious deprivation because of the
                decline of its industries, but it was revitalised. I see
                enormous potential.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also welcome the fact that, as Mr McFarland
                said, the air has now been cleared.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important for all the partners who have
                an interest in this area, and for the Assembly, to move forward
                so that the Titanic Quarter can realise its full potential, not
                only for the citizens of Belfast but for all the people of
                Northern Ireland.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Regional Development
                Committee spoke about the difficulties the Department had in
                obtaining information from the Belfast Harbour Commissioners.
                The Committee had to cope with the same level of confusion.
                Since I joined the Committee in January 2000, very few meetings
                have gone by without some reference to the Port of Belfast or
                the Belfast Harbour Commissioners and the jigsaw that is known
                as the Titanic Quarter leases.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My first impression was that many of those
                who were called to give evidence to the Committee, particularly
                people called to give evidence about the Titanic Quarter leases,
                were brief in their answers to questions and certainly did not
                volunteer any additional information. I can only attribute that
                to commercial confidentiality and perhaps to the degree of
                uncertainty that surrounded, and continues to surround, the
                future of the Committee and the Assembly. If a devolved
                Administration did not exist, the chances of any significant
                information regarding the Port of Belfast and the Titanic
                Quarter leases making its way into the public domain would be
                nil.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was much confusion in the early stages
                of the inquiry. To this day, I doubt whether anyone could write
                a factual book on the subject. I agree with the statement in the
                report that the detailed written evidence given by the Belfast
                Harbour Commissioners about the development of the Titanic
                Quarter area provided what could be considered a breakthrough in
                the Committee’s investigations. It certainly gave members a
                better insight into what had happened.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Chairperson has already said, there is
                a suggestion that the Belfast Harbour Commissioners have been
                successful in helping to make the Port of Belfast a commercial
                success, from which the economy of Northern Ireland has
                benefited. During the inquiry, the Committee was concerned about
                the lack of openness and transparency of the enterprise.
                Therefore, the statement by the Belfast Harbour Commissioners
                that they will undertake to examine their public accountability
                is welcomed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having referred to such matters as
                information in the public domain, accountability and commercial
                confidentiality, I welcome the Minister’s view on the
                recommendations on page 5 of the report. Although that issue
                might be slightly removed from the Titanic Quarter saga, it has
                a similar significance. I am not deviating from the matter in
                hand; I am availing of an opportunity. Indeed, my question
                relates to section 52 of the report. What level of
                confidentiality is expected from locally elected representatives
                who will serve on the boards of trust ports? How much
                information should they present to the councils of which they
                are members? I apologise if I deviate slightly, but in the event
                of the Assembly not meeting for some time, and as those
                representatives will take up their positions, it is important to
                know what information we can expect to get back from them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful to the Chairperson of the
                Committee, Alban Maginness, and his Deputy Chairperson, Alan
                McFarland. I am also grateful to the Committee Clerk and the
                Assistant Clerk for their guidance and expertise as we made our
                way through the mountain of paperwork and publications that
                related to the Port of Belfast and the Titanic Quarter leases.
                Now I can get rid of that four-foot-high pile of paper in my
                front room.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr S Wilson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate the Regional Development
                Committee on the work that has been done on what to some people
                might seem an esoteric topic, but is in fact an important issue.
                We are dealing with a body that has control over the largest
                swathe of development land in Belfast. The major area of
                expansion for the city lies in the harbour estate. But we are
                also dealing with a body that for years has dealt secretively
                with the development of that part of the city. From the first
                day that the Assembly was operational, Members have been
                expressing concern about what is happening in the harbour
                estate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not a member of the Committee, but I
                read the Committee report with great interest. I only wish that
                I had been on the Committee, having read through some of the
                question-and-answer sessions. As Sean Neeson said, we went
                through the same tooth-pulling process for months with the
                Harbour Commissioners, officials from the Department for
                Regional Development and the previous direct rule Minister, Lord
                Dubs. I can understand the frustration that Members must have
                felt as they tried to elicit responses and information.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Harbour Commissioners should never have
                been under any illusion about public interest in their plans for
                land that is not port related. It was well highlighted by the Ad
                Hoc Committee before devolution. It was reinforced
                post-devolution, and there were debates in the Assembly about
                the future of the port. Various options were put forward —
                from the sale of the port to keeping it under public ownership,
                with additional powers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The concern at the heart of those discussions
                was what would happen to the hundreds of acres of land in the
                port, which, at that stage, remained undeveloped. Some of the
                land was held onto by Harland &amp; Wolff in long-term leases,
                but could only be used for shipbuilding unless variations were
                sought on those leases.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Harbour Commissioners must have known
                that if those leases were to be changed, a plethora of public
                representatives from all parties would want to know what was
                going to happen to them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yet, despite entering into variation
                agreements with Harland &amp; Wolff, the Harbour Commissioners
                did not inform the Minister. Six days before the agreement was
                finally signed, they had a meeting with the Deputy Chairperson,
                and they did not inform him. Five days before, they met with the
                Committee and did not inform its members. The departmental
                official who gave evidence found out about the variation
                agreements in January, when someone from the Industrial
                Development Board mentioned it to him. If nothing else, the
                Committee has done a good job to obtain that kind of
                information.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note with interest what Mr Cushnahan said
                to the Committee on page 68 of the report:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;….when we met the Chairperson and
                Deputy Chairperson on 14 December, I had no knowledge that we
                should even have had a transaction completed on 20 December……I
                had no idea that we should have completed the agreement that
                week&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Within about half a page he is telling
                another member of the Committee that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the board finally agreed on 28 November
                2000&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">— three weeks before 20 December to give Mr
                Irwin the go-ahead to deal with the &quot;finer points of the
                transaction&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They cannot say that they had no idea that
                they were close to agreement when the board of the Harbour
                Commissioners had given permission for an official in the
                Harbour Commission to agree the final details two or three weeks
                beforehand.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once the agreement was made, knowing the
                degree of public concern, surely the Minister, the Chairperson,
                or the Deputy Chairperson, who had even gone down to see the
                Harbour Commissioners about the matter, should have been
                informed out of courtesy. It should not have been the case that
                somebody from the IDB happened to mention it to the official at
                a meeting.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must say that part of the blame rests with
                the Department. Departmental officials appear to have been of
                the view that what happened in the Belfast Harbour Commission
                had nothing to do with them. They always hid behind their
                statutory obligations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will quote from evidence given by a
                departmental official. When asked if there was detailed evidence
                from the board to the Department in relation to the timing and
                authorisation of the lease he answered no. This is amazing. Here
                was an organisation that did not have the courtesy to inform the
                Department, and we get departmental officials coming along and
                making excuses for them. His answer was</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;No, but the board was under no
                particular statutory obligation to share such information with
                us&quot;,</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">and more significantly,</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot; we were under no statutory obligation
                to seek it.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Later, he went on to say</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;In my dealings with BHC over the years
                I have been conscious that they are an independent, autonomous,
                statutory body, independent of the Government and over which the
                Department for Regional Development has no control.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That may well have been the case as far as
                the law was concerned, but the Department — and I remember
                having many gruelling meetings with departmental officials —
                was under no illusion. They knew that public representatives,
                not just in Belfast but wider afield, were concerned about what
                Belfast Harbour Commissioners got up to in relation to non-port
                lands. However, we get this type of laissez-faire attitude from
                the Department. It is little wonder that the Harbour
                Commissioners felt that they could treat the Minister, the
                Committee and the Assembly with contempt.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we look at some of the excuses they gave
                for keeping the whole deal secret, we find it gets even murkier.
                On one hand the Harbour Commissioners wrote to the Committee
                Chairperson indicating that the reason for keeping the deal
                secret was that Harland &amp; Wolff had asked them to maintain
                confidentiality. It is a pity that they did not get their story
                straight with Harland &amp; Wolff. When Sir David Fell gave
                evidence he said that he was conscious of the letter concerned.
                When asked if he agreed with it, he said that he did not. In
                fact, as far as Harland &amp; Wolff were concerned, there was no
                request for confidentiality: its representatives had been asked
                if they thought a press release was necessary and they had said
                they did not think so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, they said that they could not tell us
                when they came to the Committee because they did not know that
                the deal was going to get done — five days later — even
                though the board had authorised an official to sort out the
                finer details of the deal. Secondly, they said that they could
                not tell us because they were asked to keep the deal
                confidential by Harland &amp; Wolff; and Harland &amp; Wolff, in
                as straight terms as it possibly could, said that that was not
                true.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This issue is of great public importance, and
                the background to it is very clear. One of the options was that
                the non-port-related land should be removed from the control of
                the Belfast Harbour Commissioners — that is how strongly the
                Assembly felt about it. There almost seemed to be an indecent
                haste to sign up as much non-port-related land as possible in
                case, at some stage, the Assembly decided it was going to remove
                land from the control of the Belfast Harbour Commission.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is the real reason for the secrecy and
                the haste in this matter. The report makes recommendations on
                public accountability, and I hope that the Minister will act
                quickly on those to increase the number of public
                representatives on the board of Belfast Harbour Commissioners.
                There must be a breath of fresh air and a breath of
                accountability through the doors of the Harbour Commissioners’
                office.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A yearly update on activities in the harbour
                must be instigated. In their evidence on the Titanic Quarter,
                the Harbour Commissioners said that there would be no public
                money. I know that this is not solely the Minister’s remit,
                but I ask him to check that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On page 65 of the report Mr McFarland asked
                whether they were anticipating Government grants in the
                evaluation — or indeed for the project. The reply was that as
                far as the Harbour Commissioners were concerned, the Titanic
                Quarter development would have to stand alone.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Social Development Committee looked at
                the report on Laganside. To my surprise, one thing being
                considered was the extension of the road for Laganside into the
                Titanic Quarter. The only reason for doing so would be to use
                public money for the infrastructure of the Titanic Quarter. I
                hope that the Minister will press the Belfast Harbour
                Commissioners to find out whether the evidence that they gave to
                the Committee less than four months ago is now out of date, or
                whether they knew then that the information was incorrect.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a good example of the Assembly’s
                ability to scrutinise the darker recesses of some of the
                activities of non-accountable bodies in Northern Ireland. Such
                an important area of the city should not be under the control of
                a non-accountable body. The past practice of concealing things
                must not be allowed to continue, and the Committee’s
                recommendations will enable us to move towards much greater
                accountability.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Byrne:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a Member of the Regional Development
                Committee, I commend the report to the House. The Committee was
                concerned during its deliberations in February to hear through a
                public press release that a deal had been done on the Titanic
                Quarter. The Committee had been working on the proposal as a
                recommendation to the Department.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee’s inquiry was a good exercise
                in scrutiny. Thirty years of direct rule allowed Belfast Harbour
                Commissioners to operate almost as an independent economic
                statelet, covering almost 2,000 acres near the city of Belfast.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In carrying out its inquiry, the Committee
                held meetings with the Belfast Harbour Commissioners and the Air
                and Sea Ports Division of the Department, and it did get answers
                to the fair and honest questions that it asked. The Committee
                was always concerned about the public interest in the economic
                development of the port.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was always a suspicion on the part of
                Committee members that the full hand was not being revealed to
                us prior to the inquiry. Lessons have been learnt and put into
                effect through the new memorandum of understanding. As Mr Sammy
                Wilson said earlier, there must be much greater public
                accountability in regard to the operation of a trust port
                commission. It is not good enough to say that commercial
                confidentiality should prevent a publicly elected body such as
                the Assembly or the Minister from obtaining a full disclosure of
                negotiations and related facts, particularly when the asset in
                question is owned by the public. The Belfast Harbour
                Commissioners are trustees acting on behalf of the public.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree, however, that until now the
                Department should have been more active in ensuring stronger and
                closer collaboration, through its Air and Sea Ports Division,
                with the Belfast Harbour Commissioners. I am also conscious that
                the non-port land included the important industrial complex of
                Harland &amp; Wolff Shipbuilding and Heavy Industries Ltd, which
                has been very important to the city of Belfast. It would appear
                that there was a massive change in the leases because of
                financial difficulty pertaining to the shipyard. I am aware of
                the importance of jobs and the economic viability of that
                enterprise; therefore I understand that a change of leases was
                needed to facilitate the ongoing economic operation of the
                shipyard. It is to be hoped that lessons have been learnt. The
                new memorandum of understanding will greatly increase the
                understanding of the House, and any future Minister, of the
                operation of bodies such as trust ports.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is good that the inquiry took place, and I
                pay tribute to the Chairperson and the Deputy Chairperson for
                the effective way in which it was conducted. Every Committee
                member acted in the best interests of the public; that is our
                duty.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister for Regional Development (Mr
                Campbell):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Minister for Regional Development, with
                responsibility for ports policy in Northern Ireland, I very much
                welcome the publication today of the Committee’s report
                following the inquiry into the Titanic Quarter leases. In noting
                the Committee’s conclusions and recommendations, there is much
                in the report with which I agree. Obviously, I will want to
                consider carefully each of the report’s recommendations, and I
                intend to respond to the Committee on these in due course.
                However, I can say straight away that none of the
                recommendations surprises me. Many stem from discussions that I
                have had with the Committee for many months. In general,
                therefore, I regard them as a reasonable and sensible set of
                recommendations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In welcoming the report, I congratulate the
                Committee, particularly the Chairperson, on the way in which the
                public inquiry was conducted. It was a necessary and worthwhile
                exercise, and I am confident that lessons for the future will
                have been learnt. As the report acknowledges, a memorandum of
                understanding has already been concluded between Belfast Harbour
                Commissioners and the Department for Regional Development. This
                will ensure that the Department will be notified and consulted
                before there can be any material change in the use of any lands
                in the harbour estate, or prior to their disposal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A copy of the memorandum of understanding
                that came into effect on 1 August 2001 has been placed in the
                Assembly Library.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Belfast Harbour Commissioners entered this
                agreement voluntarily, but, as I made clear in an earlier
                statement, it remains my intention to advance suitable
                legislative proposals soon, in the form of a reserved power of
                general direction to underpin the agreement. As a consequence of
                the completion of this agreement, elected representatives can be
                assured that the public interest will be fully safeguarded in
                all future land transactions affecting the harbour.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, as I explained in my announcement of
                3 May this year, this is only one of a series of measures that
                the Department intends to implement with the aim of achieving
                greater public accountability in the trust port sector. They
                include promoting legislation to increase the number of district
                council representatives on each board, developing a code of
                practice for trust ports, and the attendance — as appropriate
                — of a senior Department for Regional Development official at
                future board meetings.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members raised the issue of public
                accountability and the level of confidentiality that would be
                required of local elected representatives on the boards of trust
                ports, including Belfast port. A public representative who is a
                member of the board will be bound by the same commercial
                confidentiality as other members of the board. There should be
                no distinction whatsoever with regard to the level of
                confidentiality.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I listened with care to the Members who said
                that the Department ought to have been more active, and I shall
                point out to Members the series of recommendations that were
                announced in early May. I am not content simply to increase the
                number of elected representatives in the trust ports, although
                for many years there has been an elected representative from
                Belfast City Council on the Belfast Harbour Commissioners.
                However, as Members know, I am deliberating the increase, and I
                note that the Committee has recommended that it should be
                increased to four in the case of Belfast. As I said earlier, I
                shall consider that and respond.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The publication of the Committee’s report,
                the introduction of the memorandum of understanding and the
                other package of measures to improve public accountability mark
                a new beginning in the relationship between Belfast Harbour
                Commissioners, other trust ports and elected representatives.
                For my part, I consider the controversy surrounding the Titanic
                Quarter lease, concluded by Belfast Harbour Commissioners late
                last year, to be now behind us. We are entering a new era. I
                have made that clear in my discussions with the Belfast Harbour
                Commissioners, and they have responded positively. It is agreed
                that we are now entering an era where we can expect better
                understanding of our mutual roles and responsibilities, and in
                which increased commercial freedom will be — and must be —
                balanced against improved public accountability.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Committee’s report points out, an
                earlier take-note motion on the future of the Port of Belfast
                was withdrawn immediately before the inquiry into the
                circumstances surrounding the Titanic Quarter development
                agreement was launched. This was unfortunate, as the Committee
                and I were, and remain, in complete agreement on the way forward
                for the port. I reiterate my conclusion that the port should
                remain in the public sector as a trust port. Like similar ports,
                it should be given wider commercial powers and greater financial
                freedom to allow it to compete better in the future.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the same time, as I have already
                mentioned, steps will be taken to improve the public
                accountability of all Northern Ireland’s trust ports.
                Publication of the report, coming after my earlier statement,
                marks the end of the debate on the future of the port. It means
                that Belfast Harbour Commissioners and port users can now plan
                the future development of the harbour with greater confidence
                and certainty.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I encourage the commissioners to seek to
                build on the port’s proud record of commercial success, while
                ensuring that the Assembly, and elected representatives in
                general, are kept fully informed of any development plans. We
                all have a vital role in ensuring that the public interest is
                safeguarded.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If there are any other issues that I have
                inadvertently not responded to in the debate, I will read
                Hansard and respond to individual Members concerned.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr A Maginness:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Neeson is correct in saying that the air
                has now been cleared. Lessons have been learned, and the report
                and inquiry have been important in achieving that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with the substance of what Mr Sammy
                Wilson said, though I might not have used his colourful
                language. Over the years, a degree of mist has surrounded the
                activities of Belfast Harbour Commissioners. I hope that that
                mist will now disappear. It occurred to me that given the DUP’s
                policy of rotation, Mr Sammy Wilson might end up as Minister for
                Regional Development. I wonder what might happen if he were to
                become Minister? However, it was only a mischievous thought.
                Strike that from the record.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Sammy Wilson was correct to bring to the
                attention of the Assembly that what we are talking about is a
                vast swathe of very valuable non-port land — not just Titanic
                Quarter, but other land as well. It must be remembered that all
                of this happened in the context of consideration by the Assembly
                and the Regional Development Committee of the forfeiture, or
                removal, of land from Belfast Harbour Commissioners.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The idea of the power of direction was
                developed as an alternative to forfeiture. As an aid to the
                development of the concept of the power of direction, and
                pending legislation, we agreed the memorandum of understanding,
                which is an interim measure to allow a degree of public control,
                albeit on a voluntary basis, over the disposal of such lands. It
                was within that context that all of this occurred. It is no
                wonder that public representatives were concerned. Mr Wilson was
                quite right to remind us of that dimension.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with Mr Byrne that it has been a good
                exercise in scrutiny by the Assembly. The report has been of
                value not only because it deals with a particular issue, but
                because it sends a message to all civil servants and officials
                in public bodies that they must be accountable and transparent
                in their activities. I agree with Mr Bradley and also with the
                Deputy Chairperson of the Committee, Mr McFarland, that public
                accountability has been the kernel of the inquiry. Public bodies
                should be accountable to the Assembly; we cannot overemphasise
                that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank everybody who contributed to the
                debate. I accept what Mr McNamee said about the report’s
                recommendations. The recommendations are important and, if
                implemented — I accept the Minister’s assurance that most of
                them will be — will help to safeguard the public interest. I
                thank the Minister for Regional Development for his contribution
                and for his acceptance of the report. I know that there are
                certain recommendations that he has not accepted in full, but I
                know that he will, none the less, consider them. That is
                indicative of the good working relationship that the Committee
                has had with the Minister. We will build upon that relationship,
                as we address issues such as the future of the Port of Belfast.</p>
