              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will see from the Order Paper that 15
              motions to amend Standing Orders have been tabled. Those relate to
              the Committee on Procedures’ report, ‘Review of the
              Legislative Process in the Northern Ireland Assembly’, which the
              House debated on 26 February 2002. Four motions are substantive;
              the others are consequential. However, as amendments to Standing
              Orders, all motions will require cross-community support if they
              are to pass.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I propose to conduct four debates on the four
              substantive motions. Members have not only the Order Paper and the
              Marshalled List of amendments for debates scheduled for later
              today, but a proposed grouping of the 15 motions into four
              sections. The first debate will take place on motions (a), (b) and
              (o); the second debate on motions (c), (h), (i), (j), (k), (l) and
              (m); the third debate on motions (d), (e), (f) and (g); and the
              fourth debate on motion (n).</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the motions are not pieces of
              legislation but changes to Standing Orders, the Business Committee
              took the view that the business should be conducted as if the
              House were dealing with amendments to a Bill, as that is what the
              House is most familiar with. I shall call the first motion, and
              then we shall debate motions (a), (b) and (o). We shall then
              continue through the other debates as I have outlined. If that is
              reasonably clear, we can proceed.</p>

              </i></font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. This
              first group of motions arises from the Committee on Procedures’
              report on its review of the legislative process as debated by the
              Assembly on 26 February 2002. They will give effect to the
              recommendations contained in that report, which the Assembly has
              already endorsed. I covered the background to the recommendations
              at some length during that debate. Therefore, I do not intend to
              go over the arguments for those changes in detail.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first group of motions relates to the
              recommendations of the Committee that the requirement for
              accelerated passage be reduced from leave of the House to
              cross-community support.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The substantive motion outlined at (o) in the
              Order Paper makes a change to Standing Order 40. Consequential
              motions are required to Standing Order 25, and those are detailed
              at (a) and (b) on the Order Paper. The consequential motions are
              technical amendments that simply make it clear that Standing
              Orders can make provision for decisions of the Assembly to be
              resolved by more than simple majority.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the debate on 26 February, concern was
              expressed by the Chairperson of the Committee for Social
              Development about potential abuse of the accelerated passage
              procedure. In its consideration of the comments expressed by
              Members during the debate, the Committee on Procedures
              acknowledged that concern. It, therefore, proposes that if a
              Minister wants accelerated passage for a Bill, his or her reason
              must first be explained to the Committee. I emphasise that that
              does not impose a requirement for a Committee’s consent;
              however, it does mean that the Committee is aware of the intention
              to seek accelerated passage and the reasons behind that intention.
              These motions insert into Standing Orders what we have been
              advised should happen as part of a Department’s pre-legislative
              consultation.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. This
              group of motions deals with Further Consideration Stage. The
              substantive motion is outlined at (m) in the Order Paper. During
              our review it became evident that, although it was important that
              Members had a second opportunity to amend a Bill, the present
              procedure for the Further Consideration Stage as a complete re-run
              of the Consideration Stage should be refined to avoid Members
              being asked to vote again on clauses or schedules that may have
              already been agreed in the previous week.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposed amendment to Standing Order 35
              will have the effect of focusing Further Consideration Stage on
              amendments proposed. Therefore, the Assembly will not be asked to
              vote to let a clause or schedule stand part of a Bill. Instead, in
              future, debate and votes at Further Consideration Stage will be
              only on amendments selected. That is in keeping with the practice
              in other places.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Seven amendments arise from this proposed
              change. The substantive motion at (c) is to amend Standing Order
              29(d) to make the definition of Further Consideration Stage
              consistent with the more focused purpose now proposed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The six consequential motions that are detailed
              at (h), (i), (j), (k), (l) and (m) are technical and relate to
              Standing Order 33, which deals with the establishment of an Ad Hoc
              Committee on conformity with equality requirements. Those
              amendments are necessary because they facilitate the interruption
              of Consideration Stage and Further Consideration Stage should a
              motion be agreed to for the appointment of such a Committee after
              either of those stages has begun.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This group of motions deals with the extension
              of Committee Stage. The substantive motion is at (d), and (e), (f)
              and (g) are consequential amendments. A key recommendation in the
              Committee’s report was that Committee Stage should be lengthened
              from its current 30-day calendar limit. Committees have complained
              that 30 calendar days do not give them enough time to scrutinise
              Bills. Indeed, our research has shown that to be true, because the
              average length of time taken for Committee Stage is nine weeks. As
              I said during the debate on the Committee’s report on 26
              February, the Committee is confident that if the Executive pick up
              on the Committee’s recommendation that draft Bills should be
              submitted to Committees as part of the pre-legislative
              consultation, that nine-week average will be reduced. As such, the
              Committee believes that it is more appropriate to lengthen
              Committee Stage from 30 calendar days to 30 working days, which
              will give Committees six weeks. It is therefore proposed to amend
              Standing Order 31(3) accordingly. Consequential amendments are
              required to Standing Orders 31(5), 33(5) and 33(7), which will
              clarify that Committee Stage will now be 30 working days instead
              of 30 calendar days.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I said in the previous debate, the change
              has been introduced to make our procedures more efficient.
              However, if the change, like the others tabled, does not work, the
              Committee will revisit the issue.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That this Assembly calls upon the Minister and
              the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to set
              up urgently a separate funding network for the provision of
              matching funds for items and/or projects identified by local
              groups commonly known as &quot;Friends of Hospitals&quot;.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I tabled this motion because we have heard so
              much recently about the funding problems faced by the Health
              Service. Looking at the current position of the Health Service
              takes me back many years to a time when the community in Ballymena
              became concerned about the high level of cardiac problems in the
              area.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several of us got together and decided that
              something had to be done to assist the local hospital and, in
              particular, the specialist whose wonderful cardiac research was
              being inhibited by a lack of funds and equipment. We met the
              business community, and in the course of a few years a tremendous
              amount of money was collected and specialist equipment was
              installed in the hospital. Great work was done in the Waveney
              Hospital in Ballymena, and the effort was such that it became the
              pattern for hospitals, not only throughout Northern Ireland but
              across the UK.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The idea came to me some time ago as a result
              of hospital visits. Staff were saying that they had problems with
              the provision of capital equipment, the lack of space and the
              funding of nurses and other staff. I began to think about the
              voluntary element of the Health Service. Volunteers have been a
              feature of health provision since the beginning of healthcare.
              Florence Nightingale, the lady with the lamp who nursed the sick
              and wounded of the Crimean war in the 1850s, and who is widely
              credited with the foundation of the modern nursing service, was a
              volunteer. The concept of volunteers in the hospital service is
              not a new tradition, but a long and honourable one. It has its
              roots in the Christian philanthropy of the industrial revolution
              during a pre-welfare age, when the only provision was voluntary.
              It is interesting that Bishop Maddox of Worcester is credited with
              being the founder of the movement in 1746.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the National Health Service began in 1948,
              the then Health Secretary, the formidable Aneurin Bevan, spelt out
              the role of volunteer workers in a welfare age. His words are
              still relevant today. He said that personal and voluntary work in
              hospitals would always be needed, and here is the punchline:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;to feel where the foot pinches and apply
              relief.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The National League of Hospital Friends was
              formed by 49 representatives from 40 hospital leagues. It later
              became the National Association of Leagues of Hospital Friends. In
              1998, to reflect the growing importance of its work in the
              community, the title was changed again to the National Association
              of Hospital and Community Friends. It has 804 affiliated groups.
              Voluntary work is a thriving tradition and a significant element
              of Health Service provision. The National Association of Hospital
              and Community Friends conducted its most recent survey in 1999. It
              shows that leagues of hospital and community friends had 36,000
              members who actively and voluntarily contributed some eight
              million hours of work a year to the National Health Service.
              However, what intrigued me most was that the survey also found
              that the leagues donate some £36 million a year to NHS hospitals.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I could go on speaking about such statistics,
              but I came across one statement that brought the point home to me.
              Neil Hidgely, a 22-year-old volunteer from Reading, said that the
              youthful &quot;Friends of Hospitals&quot; in Reading had many
              volunteers in their teenage years or in their twenties. His group
              had presented a chair to one of the hospitals. He said:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Seeing the nurses and the people being
              really thankful because they had been given a chair made me feel
              angry, but it also made me feel good because I was making a
              difference.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The &quot;Friends of Hospitals&quot; in
              Northern Ireland — those little groups that look on the local
              hospital as their hospital — are quite willing, as my contact
              with them has proved, to play their part in assisting the
              Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to achieve
              what could not otherwise be achieved because of limited funding.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would give the community a sense of
              belonging. In other words, it would be the community’s hospital,
              and people, having received healing, help and health through the
              work of their hospital, could give something back to it. It would
              reduce departmental spending. If the Department were to match
              pound for pound the amounts raised by the community groups — the
              &quot;Friends of Hospitals&quot; — expenditure would be reduced.
              That would also foster a team effort in the community that would
              bring everyone together.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must reject the amendment, especially the
              restrictions that would be placed by the wording in the final
              line, which says:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the Programme for Government and
              Priorities for Action.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want the community to be free, in
              consultation with its local hospital board, to decide on the
              priorities that can be met through its contributions.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have received one amendment to the motion. It
              is published on the Marshalled List of amendments in the name of
              Ms Sue Ramsey and Mr John Kelly.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr J Kelly:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I beg to move the following amendment: Delete
              all after &quot;to&quot; and insert</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;provide matching funds for items and/or

              of Hospitals’ where these fit in with the Programme for
              Government and Priorities for Action.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In moving the amendment, I wish to pay tribute
              to &quot;Friends of Hospitals&quot; and congratulate them on the
              immense contribution that they have made to hospital care. The
              amendment does not seek in any way to detract from the very good
              work that they have done. Rather, it seeks to broaden the scope of
              that work and to ensure that social need is met. We need to avoid
              a situation in which the rich would become healthier and the poor
              would become sicker. We need to have an equitable distribution of
              the funds that are available to the Department, and that is why we
              have moved the amendment. We do not seek in any way to diminish,
              demean or dismiss the work done by the charitable organisations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There will always be room for the charitable
              provision of extra items and projects, but it is essential that
              charities should not be called upon to provide core funding. The
              Health Service should have sufficient funds to meet its
              obligations. We could see a situation arising in which the
              Government would be quite happy to see charitable organisations
              carrying out the functions for which they should be responsible.
              They might not provide the money for health that they should do
              because charitable organisations were trying to provide it.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr McClelland] in the
              Chair)</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Targeting social need is important. The current
              situation requires much greater funding than is provided under the
              Barnett formula, which needs to be strongly opposed by the
              Minister of Finance and Personnel. Given the lack of resources for
              the Health Service, it is important that the resources that we do
              have, including those that come from the charitable sector’s
              sterling efforts, are used as fairly and efficiently as possible.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is why, at Executive level, the Programme
              for Government is agreed and why, at departmental level,
              priorities for action are drawn up. Those are used carefully to
              identify the greatest needs and to allocate resources accordingly.
              If we abandon the Programme for Government and the priorities for
              action, we abandon the possibility of co-ordinating services.
              Moreover, we abandon the chance to assess the appropriateness of
              the use of public money, and we abandon safeguards against the
              possibility of a needless duplication of services. Most
              dangerously of all, however, we abandon the system by which the
              equity of resource allocation is ensured.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the motion were to become departmental
              policy, the communities that could raise the most charitable money
              would get the most money from the Department of Health, Social
              Services and Public Safety. It is not hard to imagine that those
              communities would be the richest ones. Therefore we would have a
              situation that would make a mockery of the Department of Health’s
              campaign to end inequalities in health provision. As I said in my
              opening remarks, the rich would become healthier and the poor
              would become sicker.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having said that, I commend Rev Robert Coulter
              for tabling the motion and congratulate the &quot;Friends of
              Hospitals&quot; on the immense contribution that they have made to
              hospital care. However, these are the small dangers — maybe
              great dangers — that we envisage in the adoption of this motion.
              I support the amendment.</p>
              <i>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gallagher:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I stress that I am speaking on this matter as
              an Assembly Member, and not on behalf of the Committee for Health,
              Social Services and Public Safety.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the opportunity that this motion
              gives us to speak on the involvement of voluntary groups with the
              Health Service, and Colleagues will agree that support from local
              groups such as &quot;Friends of Hospitals&quot; is to be welcomed.
              Members are only too aware that severe budgetary constraints on
              the Health Service have meant that it has not always been possible
              to provide better facilities and more comfortable surroundings
              through public funds. Voluntary fund-raising undoubtedly helps,
              creating a sense of ownership of the public services.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although I welcome the endeavour and enterprise
              of community groups in raising funds for local projects, I strike
              a cautionary note about making a commitment to match public
              resources with a carte blanche. Substantial capital investment in
              hospital equipment, such as MRI scanners, can bring with it heavy
              recurrent running costs, which need to be factored into future
              budgets. We have to bear in mind that investment in new technology
              will be accompanied by the administrative and staffing costs of
              the nurses and doctors who man it. The Health Committee’s two
              inquiries into children’s residential care and cancer services
              both strongly highlighted the importance of the voluntary and
              community sectors, working collaboratively with the Department,
              the boards, and the trusts to address priorities in the Health
              Service.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is clearly a need for substantial
              fund-raising activity to improve the comfort of patients. However,
              that work has to be co-ordinated closely with the work and
              objectives of the Department in order to fully optimise the
              benefits for everybody in the region.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Courtney:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with the spirit of the motion. However,
              the proposed amendment fits in with our Programme for Government
              and priority for action, and, therefore, my party will be
              supporting the amendment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In too many instances, the amount of money
              needed far exceeds that which &quot;Friends of Hospitals&quot; can
              raise. However, without that money hospitals would be unable to
              cope with the demand for sophisticated and up-to-date equipment. I
              worked in Altnagelvin Hospital from 1961. As everyone is aware, it
              was the first hospital to be built in post-war Britain. The fact
              that it took almost 11 years from planning through to construction
              and the commissioning stage meant that equipment quickly became
              obsolete — not by the design, but by technology.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At that time there were four acute hospitals in
              the Derry, Limavady, and Strabane area, plus two psychiatric
              hospitals, Stradreagh and Gransha, each with a group that raised
              funds. We had Friends of Roe Valley, St Columbs, Stradreagh,
              Gransha, Strabane, and Waterside. Altnagelvin replaced all four
              acute hospitals, and currently Friends of Altnagelvin raises
              valuable funds through flag days, cake sales, the sale of
              Christmas cards, and other activities. They raise around £10,000,
              which, although invaluable, is generally spread quite thinly.
              Having it doubled would help.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the years these groups have bought some
              invaluable equipment, as have other groups that have raised funds
              specifically for areas such as cardiac services, neonatology or
              pain relief clinics. However, other funding priorities have seen
              donations dwindle, as people try their best to support other
              charities. For example, in my area, the Foyle Hospice for the
              terminally ill and relatives’ respite care, Macmillan Cancer
              Relief and various cancer charities would find it difficult to
              cope without that community support.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will give a few examples. In the north-west
              edition of last night’s ‘Belfast Telegraph’, there were
              appeals for the sensory impaired and a children’s cancer unit,
              which has currently raised £47,000. A chain walk across both
              bridges in Derry has been organised for the weekend. It is hoped
              that 3,000 people will take part in the event to raise a further
              £3,000 for the children’s cancer unit. Money is also being
              raised for a 10-month-old child who was born without a brain stem.
              Children from the Cathedral Youth Club in the Fountain raised
              money, through a sponsored walk, to give him an easier lifestyle.
              We also had an appeal for Help the Aged. These charities are well
              worth supporting, and any extra funding would benefit them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recently, the wife of one of my friends died.
              She was treated in the Mid-Ulster Hospital. Unfortunately, the
              time from the diagnosis until her death was short. My friend
              wished to do something to help the hospital. I can give examples
              of some of the equipment that the hospital said that it needed
              urgently: two Colleague intravenous infusion pumps, each costing
              £1,600; a critical blood pressure monitor, which costs £2,000;
              an infant resuscitator costing £9,000; a foetal monitor, which
              costs £5,000; a sofa for the midwives’ restroom at £850; an
              electric couch for a treatment room at £810; and a new incubator
              for the children’s unit at £15,000. In total, almost £36,000
              was raised, which for a small community was an excellent response
              to an appeal that lasted only four months. It is obvious that such
              people give much more to the community and deserve our thanks.
              Anything that improves funding for vital services is needed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was a fire at Altnagelvin Hospital last
              night, and 60 elderly patients, including stroke victims, had to
              be evacuated from the geriatric unit. Thanks to the excellent care
              and extra service that was provided by the hospital, the Fire
              Service and the ambulance crew, all the patients were evacuated
              safely to other parts of the hospital. I commend not only the
              staff there, but those who returned during their off-duty time to
              ensure that the elderly were not left in a more traumatic
              condition. As we know, it is difficult for an elderly person to be
              moved to unfamiliar surroundings. For that reason, all those
              members of staff deserve our thanks.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last month, the Committee for Health, Social
              Services and Public Safety visited Altnagelvin Hospital and saw
              the stroke unit. We know how difficult it is to move stroke
              patients, and they too were safely moved out during the fire. We
              support the spirit of the motion because all aspects of the Health
              Service would benefit. However, the amendment keeps any action in
              closer line with the Programme for Government and the priorities
              for action; therefore, the SDLP will be supporting the amendment.</p>

              cúraim inár n-ospidéil agus ar fud na seirbhíse.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Rev Robert Coulter and Mr McFarland for
              stimulating this important debate on the debt that we owe to those
              in the voluntary sector who work so tirelessly in the interests of
              hospital patients and others. I also endorse Annie Courtney’s
              support for the staff who coped magnificently with safely
              evacuating the elderly from Altnagelvin Hospital last night. It is
              at such times when the support of the local community and
              &quot;Friends of Hospitals&quot; is welcomed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate the suggestion by Rev Robert
              Coulter that we should make greater use of the voluntary sector in
              developing our services. Today’s debate provides us with an
              opportunity to reflect on the enormously important role of the
              community in developing and maintaining the highest standards of
              care in our hospitals and throughout the service. That recognition
              was expressed by all Members in the debate, and I welcome that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Rev Robert Coulter highlighted the noble
              tradition of personal and voluntary endeavours in aiding our
              hospital services. There has been a long history of voluntary
              sector involvement in the development of hospitals and many other
              services here. Some of our hospitals were established by local
              communities through public subscription. Others have been
              supported through the years by generations of local people who
              have voluntarily given up their time and money. The new wing at
              the Mater Hospital was made possible by the efforts and dedication
              of the local community, and I was delighted to visit it recently.
              Other Members have spoken of similar visits that they have made to
              hospitals in their areas.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Voluntary organisations and community groups
              play a vital role in representing their communities. Those groups
              often draw their membership from individuals who have direct
              experience of illness, either personally or through someone close
              to them, and they may want to give something back to their
              community. They contribute in many different ways. I pay tribute
              to all those communities and individuals for their dedication, the
              commitment of their time and energy and the vital role that they
              play in the development of our services. They are part of our
              caring society, and they enrich it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also want to pay tribute to the support that
              &quot;Friends of Hospitals&quot; have given to our trusts. Over
              the years their contributions have ranged from the provision of
              support for training to the purchase of much-needed specialist
              equipment. Given the current funding pressures on our services,
              and the history of underfunding, their efforts are doubly valued.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recognise and appreciate the intentions
              behind the motion. The excellent work and support of the
              &quot;Friends of Hospitals&quot; are valued by the service, and it
              is important that their work continues to complement and augment
              existing services. Therefore, to be of maximum benefit, it is
              essential that we build on the Health Service’s existing close
              working relationship with voluntary trusts, societies and the
              voluntary sector to ensure that such input generates the best
              return in terms of improvements to patient care and treatment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is vital that that collaboration take place
              to ensure that projects complement and contribute to public
              service priorities. I need hardly add that if proposals generate a
              recurring commitment, they must be factored into our spending
              plans, otherwise they risk skewing resources from priority areas.
              It is important, therefore, that each proposal be looked at on its
              merits and that we target support to accord with our overall
              priorities. Consequently, a separate funding network would not be
              in the best interests of our service. Indeed, any blanket
              arrangement for separate funding could divert vital resources from
              key priorities. That would place greater pressure on our front
              line services, rather than improve services, and, as John Kelly
              said, it might also adversely impact on important programmes such
              as new targeting social need and the equality agenda, which aim to
              provide care for all our people on an equitable basis.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the proposed plan is not the optimum
              choice at this time, there are real opportunities to consider
              individual proposals case-by-case. There are many examples where
              that has worked well, and important projects have been taken
              forward successfully in partnership. Trusts must listen to the
              communities that they serve when developing their priorities, and,
              where a given proposal complements the overall strategic aim, an
              appropriate business case can be jointly developed to examine the
              viability of a project, while identifying its benefits and its
              full capital and revenue implications.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore, our best way forward is to be able
              to consider proposals case-by-case, with the closest possible
              linkage between the statutory sector and the voluntary and
              charitable trusts, and the building of a business case with local
              trusts to ensure that the tremendous voluntary efforts are
              advancing the priorities that we have agreed.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Ramsey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I
              thank Rev Robert Coulter and Mr McFarland for tabling the motion.
              Although I agree with the sentiment and the thinking behind it,
              support for the motion will cause concerns, which several Members
              highlighted. Agreeing the motion would result in affluent areas
              such as parts of north Down and Ballymena, which can raise about
              £100,000, having that amount matched by the Department of Health,
              Social Services and Public Safety. Areas such as Falls Road,
              Shankill Road, and parts of Derry and Tyrone, which might be able
              to raise only about £10,000, would be entitled to have only that
              amount matched by the Department. That gives me concern, given
              that we have priorities for action, a Programme for Government and
              targeting social needs.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With that in mind, John Kelly and I have tabled
              an amendment that covers many of the concerns that other Members
              raised. I thank and commend groups such as &quot;Friends of
              Hospitals&quot; for their hard work, commitment and dedication in
              raising much-needed finances for local hospitals. I am sure that
              without their work, some services would be worse off. The
              amendment is based on reality. Although a group in north Down
              could raise £100,000 for an MRI scanner, that might not be a
              priority for the people there. The Department’s money would be
              tied up because it would be duty-bound to match that £100,000.
              That goes to the core of the matter.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with Tommy Gallagher, who added a note
              of concern to the original motion. Fund-raising must be carried
              out in conjunction with the Department of Health, Social Services
              and Public Safety, which has produced priorities for action. Those
              priorities are supported by the Committee for Health, Social
              Services and Public Safety, which has a part to play also.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not agree with Rev Robert Coulter’s
              contention that the amendment restricts people’s ability to
              raise money; it does not do that. We should be thankful that
              people are raising money. The amendment is designed to ensure that
              the money will go to the heart of the problem, targeting the
              established priorities and problems of the community.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with the Minister’s assertion that
              community groups and voluntary organisations have an important
              part to play in the Health Service. However, trusts must listen to
              the communities that they serve. That ties in with the priorities
              for action and the Programme for Government, and it is upon that
              reality that John Kelly and I have based our amendment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fundamental issue of the motion and the
              amendment is that the Health Service has been seriously
              underfunded for many years. I welcome yesterday’s commitment by
              Dr Farren to provide more funding for health. The Executive have
              said that health is a priority. My concern, however, is that the
              additional money is not enough. It is a welcome start, but we need
              to get to the core of the problem: if we want changes in the
              Health Service, we must address underfunding.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask Members to support the amendment.
              Although we cannot prevent people from raising money in good
              faith, we must not allow those who are unable to raise similar
              amounts to be discriminated against. The rich will get healthier
              and the poor will get sicker. We need to ensure that everyone in
              society has the opportunity to become healthier. Go raibh maith
              agat.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hamilton:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I welcome the Minister’s addressing
              the problem, and I thank her for acknowledging the voluntary
              sector’s vital role in assisting the Health Service and
              hospitals and helping out sometimes, when the Department cannot
              find appropriate funds. I thank her for acknowledging the work of
              &quot;Friends of Hospitals&quot; and for her commitment to
              continue developing relationships with such groups.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall be brief. Mr Gallagher spoke about the
              contribution of voluntary groups and the vital role of
              &quot;Friends of Hospitals&quot;, with their ability to provide
              equipment and services that the Department may not always be able
              to fund. He talked about the need to work with the Department of
              Health, Social Services and Public Safety — it has never been
              the intention of &quot;Friends of Hospitals&quot; to work without
              full consultation with, and in conjunction with, the Department.
              Rev Robert Coulter’s motion covers that point.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Courtney mentioned the number of hospitals
              in her constituency that, at different times, have experienced
              difficulties with the provision of equipment and services. She too
              acknowledged the vital role that organisations such as
              &quot;Friends of Hospitals&quot; provide in meeting the needs of
              the area that she represents.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Robert Coulter has given the reasons why
              the Ulster Unionist Party cannot support the amendment. We would
              like &quot;Friends of Hospitals&quot; to be able to operate with
              total freedom to meet the needs of the hospitals that they
              represent, and, in collecting for their hospital, contribute to
              the needs of that hospital and help it to develop the services
              required in their area.</p>

              highlighted its success in other parts of the UK. The Department
              should consider seriously the motion. I, therefore, urge Members

              Health, Social Services and Public Safety to introduce a screening
              system for all pre-school children to assist in the early
              diagnosis of autism and to make adequate provision for the needs
              of autistic children.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the past year, the plight of autistic
              children and their parents has been brought into sharp focus
              through events that attracted the attention of the media. In
              Britain, the fears surrounding a possible link between autism and
              the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination reopened issues
              relating to the causes of autism, provoking considerable
              controversy and disagreement among healthcare professionals and
              Government Ministers. In the Republic, the Supreme Court decision
              in the Sinott case, and the publication of a special task force
              report on autism, raised public awareness of the provision of
              educational services for autistic children. In recent weeks, the
              announcement by Ministers McGuinness and Woods of the first
              all-Ireland centre of excellence for autism education marked a
              step in the right direction and brought a long overdue recognition
              of the increasing level of concern about autism and autistic
              spectrum disorders on the island of Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The purpose of the motion and the subsequent
              debate is neither to come to conclusions on the causes of autism,
              nor is it to agree on a single approach to the education of
              children with autism. The purpose of the debate is to increase
              Members’ and Ministers’ awareness of autism and to agree on
              what all parents and professionals who work in the field of autism
              already know: the earlier that formal diagnosis is made of
              children who suffer from autism, the earlier effective educational
              methods can be employed to ensure those children have the
              opportunity to lead normal lives.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our Department of Health, Social Services and
              Public Safety and our Department of Education have responsibility
              for the diagnosis of autism and appropriate interventions, such as
              speech and language therapy. However, owing to the mix of
              Departments and professionals involved, there has been an ad-hoc
              development of autistic services in Northern Ireland. Voluntary
              organisations such as Parents’ Education as Autism Therapists
              (PEAT) and Parents and Professionals &amp; Autism (PAPA) have been
              left to bear the brunt of promoting the needs of autistic children
              and their carers.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An important piece of recent research, which
              represented a major step forward, was the Northern Ireland scoping
              research into the diagnosis of autism. Although advances were made
              in the 1990s in the early diagnosis of autism compared with the
              situation in the 1980s, the report’s recommendations were not
              fully implemented at trust and health board level. Today,
              individual trusts have different referral paths, and there is a
              wide range of differences between the level of services offered by
              the North’s health trusts and boards. Only the Down Lisburn
              Trust, the Homefirst Community Trust, and Newry and Mourne Trust
              offer formal diagnosis services. They have been innovative and
              proactive with their respective health boards. Other trusts have
              lagged behind. Some are even in denial and refuse to accept the
              reality of the illness, or disability.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is generally recognised that the early
              diagnosis of autism, which leads to early treatment and
              intervention, can have huge benefits and make a significant
              difference to the quality of life for autistic children and their
              parents.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A major piece of work is currently being
              conducted by a task force that consists of the Department of
              Health, Social Services and Public Safety, the Department of
              Education and voluntary groups. It is essential that its report
              contain proposals from the Department of Health recommending the
              introduction of a screening programme for all pre-school children.
              That is vital — according to the National Initiative for Autism:
              Screening and Assessment (NIASA), almost 50% of children are not
              diagnosed as autistic until they are 16 years old. Many parents
              and children in Northern Ireland are living with the consequences
              of autism and a failure to diagnose their children’s illness at
              an early stage; some of those parents are here today.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall elaborate on the nature of this
              illness, the effect that it has on children and their parents and
              why early diagnosis and intervention is vital to its treatment.
              Autism is an illness of which I was aware, but, like many, I never
              appreciated fully the effect that it has on children and their
              families until a mother in my constituency contacted me to express
              her concerns about her child, who has not yet been formally
              diagnosed as suffering from autism. She also expressed her fears
              about the level of education services available. Her child was
              born healthy, without complications and with no history of serious
              illness in the family. After 19 months, the parents became
              increasingly concerned that their child was not developing normal
              communication and social skills. Despite the fact that two years
              have elapsed since their concerns surfaced, their child has not
              yet been formally diagnosed as suffering from autism, even though
              the child is displaying all the symptoms of the illness and is
              approaching school age. The mother was told authoritatively in a
              private consultation that her child was autistic, but the health
              authorities have not yet recognised that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The symptoms of autism include a difficulty in
              acquiring, using and understanding speech, and using other forms
              of communication, including gestures and facial expressions.
              Children who are autistic can often relate well to their parents
              and carers, but not to other children. Autistic children also have
              a highly restricted range of behaviours and interests, may have
              repetitive body movements and a preference for routine, and may
              have a preoccupation with certain objects and activities. Those
              three characteristics are known as the &quot;triad of
              impairments&quot;, and they are familiar to many families in the
              North who live with them 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Autistic children often represent a
              considerable challenge to those who care for, train, educate and
              support them. Children who suffer from autism need constant care
              and attention. In many cases, parents, like the mother who asked
              for my help and, indeed, that of the Assembly, have had to give up
              their employment to care full-time for their children. That has
              put considerable pressure on many families, who feel that they
              have been abandoned by the authorities, especially by the Health
              Department.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Autism will not go away, and the Minister of
              Health must take it seriously. Autism-UK stated that during the
              1990s the rate of children being diagnosed with autistic spectrum
              disorders rose significantly. For example, some areas of Britain
              and Northern Ireland are recording rates as high as one in 200
              children; overall the illness affects four times more males than
              females.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once formal diagnosis has been made, early
              intervention is essential. Specialist education is critical.
              Delivered in a structured environment it can minimise behavioural
              difficulties and enhance an individual’s skills and life
              experiences. The two most effective methods are TEACCH (treatment
              and education of autistic and related communication handicapped
              children) and ABA (applied behaviour analysis). The latter, which
              entails intensive behavioural intervention, shows an autistic
              child how to learn academic and behavioural skills. ABA
              programmes, which can involve intensive learning of up to 40 hours
              a week with a trained professional, can be tailored to suit the
              individual needs of a child. Properly designed and delivered, ABA
              programmes contain most, if not all, of the necessary components
              for the effective treatment of children with autism. However, in
              Northern Ireland, the majority of parents who choose that teaching
              method must finance the programme themselves. They must deal with
              hostile attitudes towards the inclusion of ABA in the statementing
              process, despite the fact that research findings have shown that
              up to 40% of children with autism can benefit from ABA to the
              extent of being indistinguishable from normal children.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Due to varying resources and recognition of the
              gravity of autistic disorders by different trusts and health
              boards in Northern Ireland, there is glaring inequality in access
              to diagnosis, intervention and educational services. That must not
              continue. Why should parents and children who live in Tyrone and
              Fermanagh, for example, be denied the same access to, and
              standards of, services that are available in areas where the
              health trusts have the foresight and commitment to deal with
              autism?</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In March 2002 two new units were opened in the
              Republic to deal with autistic children.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The lack of clear direction and commitment of
              resources for autism by the health authorities has been marked.
              The Minister must take the issue seriously and take the lead on
              it, as her counterpart in education has done. Under the new
              equality legislation, the Minister and the Department of Health,
              Social Services and Public Safety have a public duty to ensure
              that all parents have equal access to the same level of diagnosis
              and intervention services. We eagerly await the publication of the
              task force report, which is due at the end of this month.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Autistic children and their parents do not have
              the luxury of time. They urgently require a screening programme
              for all pre-school children and equal access to services for
              autistic children throughout Northern Ireland.</p>
              <b>

              to five minutes.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have received one amendment to the motion,

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I beg to move the following amendment: Delete
              all after &quot;to&quot; and insert:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;introduce a training programme for Health
              Visitors, School Nurses, Keystage 1 and Nursery School Teachers to
              facilitate the early detection of autism and to make adequate
              provision in collaboration with the Department of Education to
              meet the needs of autistic children.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr Byrne for bringing to the Assembly
              an issue that vexes parents and society, because autistic children
              are special.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Ramsey and I tabled the amendment because
              there is no widely acceptable, credible tool for universal mass
              screening. We believe that the use of any such mass-screening tool
              could create more problems than it solves, by creating false
              positives and negatives. In other words, children may be diagnosed
              as autistic when they are not, and autism may remain undetected in
              others.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are also serious resource implications to
              consider. The cost of providing a mass-screening tool may impact
              on resources for treating autism. By training health visitors,
              school nurses, and Key Stage 1 and nursery teachers we can
              establish a framework for individual assessment that will be much
              more effective in detecting the spectrum of autism.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The key issue, which was missed by the
              well-intentioned motion, is that we must allocate more resources
              and support to meet the needs of autistic children, and their
              parents and carers.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was in that context that Sinn Féin tabled
              the amendment. I thank Mr Byrne for bringing this difficult and
              vexing issue to the House. However, the amendment will much more
              effectively provide for those difficulties that are suffered by
              autistic children and their parents.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Robert Coulter:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate Mr Byrne for bringing this
              motion before the House. It is fitting that the Assembly should
              debate the matter today. However, I support the amendment, because
              it reaches beyond the original proposition and adds much more
              strength to what we are aiming at.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Early intervention is essential in the
              diagnosis of autism. The sooner that therapy begins, the better
              chance there is of a child’s speech and behaviour progressing.
              Professionals are understandably reluctant to label a child
              autistic. However, many children reach the age of six or seven —
              sometimes even adulthood — before being fully diagnosed. Health
              boards and trusts should work closely with education boards to
              ensure that parents and teachers have an early route for those
              children who reach school without being diagnosed. Health
              visitors, nurses and doctors should also receive specialist
              training in the symptoms to look out for, as in the majority of
              cases an autistic child is diagnosed as a result of an initial
              diagnosis of hearing or speech problems.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As well as early diagnosis being essential for
              a child’s development, financial and practical help is also
              available once a diagnosis of special needs has been made.
              Pre-school teachers, special nursery places, and occupational and
              speech therapy can then be availed of, as well as financial help
              for struggling parents who are often forced out of work because
              they must look after a child with learning difficulties. The
              disability living allowance (DLA) also needs to be re-examined.
              Many cases exists of parents of autistic children being turned
              down for that benefit. They have to undergo the trauma of an
              appeal to prove that their child needs help. A diagnosis of autism
              should be enough for DLA to be granted.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My views come not only from my interest in
              autism as a member of the Health Committee — they are expressed
              from the heart of a grandfather of an autistic boy. My grandson,
              who has just turned seven, was diagnosed with autism at the age of
              two and a half when he was referred to a speech therapist. He
              still has no speech. However, he was one of the lucky ones who
              benefited from early therapy, a nursery school place and a place
              at a special school where the staff were experienced in dealing
              with autistic spectrum disorder. His parents have also been
              greatly helped by Parents and Professionals &amp; Autism (PAPA). I
              pay tribute to the work of that organisation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many autistic children in Northern Ireland have
              gone undetected and will continue to do so until we channel funds
              and personnel into that vital work. Some dictionaries describe
              autism as being &quot;divorced from reality&quot;. It is time that
              MLAs woke up to reality and realised that autism is on the
              increase. We must be vigilant and help the health professionals.
              It is not only the need for early diagnosis that is essential. We
              must also implement a thorough programme of research that is aimed
              at finding the root causes of autism.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has already been considerable debate
              within the community about the alleged links between autism and
              the MMR vaccine. I wish to emphase that I am not opposed to the
              vaccination of children. However, Northern Ireland is a democratic
              society, and one of the foundation stones of any democracy is
              freedom of choice. Parents must have the freedom to choose whether
              they want their children to be vaccinated with the single MMR jab
              or to receive those vaccinations separately. The MMR vaccine’s
              reputation has become tarnished because of its alleged links with
              autism.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the tragedies of autism is that, as yet,
              there is no known cure. Early diagnosis is therefore essential, as
              is an in-depth research programme into the causes of autism. It is
              also vital that a full independent inquiry be carried out into the
              safety of the MMR jab. I support the amendment.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs I Robinson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion, and I thank Mr Byrne for
              tabling it. I shall include in my comments the needs of autistic
              adults, because they too require proper attention and adequate
              provision from the Department of Health, Social Services and
              Public Safety. Public awareness of autistic spectrum disorder and
              the Government’s duty to target and fund measures against the
              illness must increase and must reflect better direction. We must
              all understand exactly what autism is, and how it affects both
              individuals and those who care for them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Autism is a disability that disrupts the
              development of social and communication skills. It is believed
              that approximately 70% of those who suffer from autistic spectrum
              disorder also have learning difficulties. Whatever their level of
              ability, which varies widely — some have incredible special
              talents — they all share a common difficulty in making sense of
              the world in comparison with other children of a similar age and
              background. The common denominator is a clear difficulty with
              social relationships. The individual’s ability to join in social
              activities is clearly impaired, as is his or her capacity to
              understand the feelings of others. Most sufferers of autistic
              spectrum disorder experience great difficulty in acquiring, using
              and understanding speech; they also have problems with facial
              expressions and gestures. Typical behaviour and characteristics of
              autism include: resistance to normal teaching methods; sustained,
              odd play; lack of eye contact; apparent insensitivity to pain; a
              stand-offish manner; crying and tantrums for no apparent reason;
              and resistance to any change in routine.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Research suggests that there is no single cause
              for autism, but that it is a physical problem affecting those
              parts of the brain that integrate language and information
              processed from the senses. The condition is of physical, not
              emotional, origin and can be identified by the age of three in
              most children. Unfortunately, there is no known cure for autism,
              but with appropriate education and support services, sufferers can
              be helped to live with as much dignity and independence as
              possible. We in Northern Ireland can help to deliver that through
              the Assembly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The significance of the central aim of the
              motion, namely early intervention, cannot be underestimated.
              Coupled with specialist education, early intervention is vital if
              children with autism are to develop their full potential in life.
              Early diagnosis of the disability is the first crucial step
              towards helping them to lead full lives. The later a child is
              diagnosed, the more he or she has had time to feel different and
              isolated from others, and the greater the trauma and worry for the
              family.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the years, several constituents whose
              children are autistic have contacted me. The effect that autistic
              spectrum disorder has had on the child and the family unit is
              shocking. For the family, it is hard to cope with a child who
              cannot mix socially and is indifferent to other children.
              Inappropriate social behaviour, tantrums and disruptive actions
              can cause much distress and worry within the family, so support
              and direction from those who know and care about autistic issues
              are essential. Isolation does not affect only the sufferers of
              autism; in many circumstances, their families experience it also.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am often asked: &quot;To whom do we turn?
              What help can we get?&quot; There are groups and individuals who
              are making a serious attempt to help autistic spectrum disorder
              sufferers and their families to come to terms with the condition
              and to provide a decent life for them. Autism is a lifelong
              illness; the sooner it is diagnosed and cared for, the better for
              the child and his or her family.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The hard work and dedication of groups such as
              PAPA and Barnardo’s, which encourage and initiate training and
              research into the subject to facilitate better diagnosis and early
              intervention, cannot be praised highly enough. I support the
              motion.</p>

              </i><b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a timely motion, given the recent
              public debate. The Committee for Health, Social Services and
              Public Safety debated the link between the measles, mumps and
              rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism when it became a crisis in the
              community. For that reason, it is important to debate autism
              exclusively.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are several reasons why Joe Byrne’s
              motion is useful. It is strong because of the great public concern
              about the incidence of autism in children, and, until we find out
              how extensive that is, it will be very difficult to allocate
              resources to deal with it. Indeed, as other Members said, the
              earlier that autism is diagnosed, the earlier help can be given
              not just to the child, but to carers and supporters of families
              with autistic children.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Debate on autism has also been taking place in
              Britain. It is interesting that the Minister of State for Health,
              Jacqui Smith, has said that she will look positively at a national
              screening programme if it facilitates understanding of the
              syndrome. Others have talked about the spectrum of disorders. If
              officials in Britain are giving serious thought to a national
              screening programme, we must do likewise in Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">According to research conducted in the United
              States and recently published in the Journal of the American
              Medical Association, there has been a fourfold increase in autism.
              The research suggests that autism has not suddenly become more
              widespread because of a recent occurrence, but rather that it is
              now detected more often. If that is the case, it is due to
              screening.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the detection of the condition is on the
              increase, not only are health professionals being better trained,
              but screening has been introduced to determine the extent of
              autism. The message from the United States and Britain is that we
              would do well to consider introducing a screening programme here.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also important to urge people who are
              concerned about the link between MMR and autism to follow advice
              and opt for the triple jab, rather than single vaccines, given the
              dangers that can arise as a result of delays in individual
              inoculations. Single jabs would increase the risk of disease and
              would also have huge resource implications. It may lead to people
              not having their children vaccinated, because single vaccines take
              much longer to administer than triple jabs. Triple jabs save
              resources.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we advise that the link to autism is not
              proven, and promote the triple jab, we must not leave it at that.
              We must respond to those who are concerned and confused about the
              links between MMR and autism. As was suggested in the Health
              Committee and elsewhere, a national screening programme is the
              only way to allay the fears of those who write to us: the parents
              of autistic children, and other parents who demand the
              introduction of single vaccines in their GP practices. We must
              answer them; the best response is to continue to advise parents to
              choose the triple vaccine, and to introduce a screening programme
              for autistic spectrum disorders alongside it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome, as did Rev Robert Coulter, the
              announcement of the new centre, which is supported by parents and
              professionals in the field of autism. For many years, we have
              known that self-help and support groups have much to offer. They
              work alongside professionals and the task forces that deal with
              autism, bringing together all their knowledge and expertise. That
              inter-agency approach is extremely important.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the amendment in its own right is not
              to be ignored. If screening is introduced, it will be necessary to
              have the training in place.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate my Colleague Joe Byrne on
              tabling the motion and for mentioning the bodies that are
              available to help parents whose children have been diagnosed as
              autistic.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">PAPA was formed in 1989 by a group of concerned
              parents and professionals. It is a registered charity in Northern
              Ireland, whose aim is to promote the needs of those with autistic
              spectrum disorders and their carers. A central office was
              established in 1992, and a western regional office in 1999. PAPA
              was first established with a staff of three. It was given a
              recurring budget of £40,000 per annum for three years. There are
              now between seven and nine staff. Unfortunately, however, its
              central funding remains the same. The service could not survive
              without volunteers.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my own area, the Foyle Community Trust in
              the Western Health and Social Services Board used to allocate some
              funds, but was unable to help in the last financial year. I have
              spoken to health professionals, and the consensus is that two
              problems stand out as critical to care. The first, mentioned by
              every Member who has spoken, is early diagnosis. The second is
              increased central funding. It was said yesterday that to underline
              the dire need for increased funding in the Foyle area for autistic
              spectrum disorders, we have simply to look at the number of
              doctors who can treat or diagnose patients with autism or
              associated disorders in the area. At present, there is only one
              part-time doctor who is qualified to diagnose patients with the
              condition. The waiting time for this doctor stands at 10 to 11
              months. That is unacceptable.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The crucial point seems to be that until a
              child or individual is diagnosed, the family and the child are in
              a state of limbo. Once diagnosis has taken place progress can be
              made, but an 11-month waiting list is perceived as being simply
              not good enough. Yesterday, the Foyle Community Trust manager for
              learning disability services said that it provides a service for
              any child with a severe learning disability. However, medium and
              milder cases do not receive care. A child who is just above or
              below the set requirements will miss out because the funding is
              not there.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">PAPA provides parents and carers with leaflets
              that give valuable information; however, as specialist education
              and structured support can assist in maximising a child’s skills
              and in minimising any behavioural problems, the right education
              and care programmes are essential. For example, all children —
              not just autistic children — throw tantrums. Unless
              professionals are trained to recognise symptoms of the condition,
              sufferers can be left undiagnosed until adulthood.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I therefore support the motion, but a serious
              attempt to address the problem must be made by education and
              library boards so that it can be recognised by all health
              professionals. Central funding must also be addressed so that
              children can avail of specialist help and parents are not left to
              cope with the problem alone. The educational needs of autistic
              children are paramount also.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr William McCrea:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a requirement to address the challenge
              of screening, diagnosis and early intervention for children with
              autism. Why does this need exist? The answer is simple: for too
              long, early diagnosis has been a struggle for many people to
              achieve.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Screening leading to diagnosis should in turn
              lead smoothly to intervention by the appropriate health authority.
              However, many parents, particularly those with young children of
              pre-school age, have spoken to me — and I am sure to many others
              in the House — about falling into a black hole immediately after
              diagnosis, and the Assembly seeks to fill that void. Many parents,
              indeed several from my constituency, believe that the present
              system has failed them and that they have been left with no other
              recourse than to seek alternative expensive private consultations.
              They hope that their child’s condition will be diagnosed
              properly, that his or her abilities will be assessed, and that
              that will lead to a genuine consideration of the child’s future
              health and education needs.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like other Members, I can produce many letters
              from parents expressing their distress at what they see as a
              failure in the system. It saddens me that they think that the
              system that was designed to offer them support and guidance when
              they are most needed has failed. There is a strong consensus among
              professionals about that, and Joanne Douglas of the Spectrum
              Diagnostic Assessment and Theory Centre of Queen’s University,
              Belfast said:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Early intervention is beneficial for
              children with autism, partly because it is thought that they need
              intensive support to reach their optimal learning, and partly
              because early intervention is known to help reduce challenging
              behaviour.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No doubt, it will be argued that the current
              guidelines do not recommend universal screening for pre-school
              children with autism on the basis that there are no suitable
              screening instruments. However, if an autistic spectrum disorder
              is not identified at an early age, it follows that the extent of
              the need for provision will not be recognised either — that is a
              catch-22 situation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a clear consensus that early
              identification must be achieved through the increased professional
              awareness of all community staff who have contact with young
              children and their families, particularly GPs, health visitors and
              educational psychologists. The consequences of not diagnosing
              autism at an early stage are worth bearing in mind. A survey
              conducted last year by the National Autistic Society said that
              only 43% of children at the less able end of the spectrum were
              diagnosed before the age of five, despite</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Having urgent needs that could have been
              addressed through early intervention.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Approximately 18% of people at the lower end of
              the spectrum did not receive a proper diagnosis until the age of
              16 or beyond, yet evidence suggests that autism is becoming more
              prevalent, and I have statistics from other parts of the United
              Kingdom that show that. When I tried to ascertain the number of
              cases of autism in each health board area in Northern Ireland, I
              was disappointed to be informed by the Department of Health,
              Social Services and Public Safety that those statistics were
              unavailable. Does that not therefore acknowledge that if the
              information is unavailable, the appropriate provision for children
              is also unavailable?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another survey conducted by the National
              Autistic Society showed that only 38% of adults with an autistic
              spectrum disorder admitted to having had a community care
              assessment. For many, slipping through the net until adulthood
              brought further complications, and those left to struggle without
              support more often than not spiralled into mental decline. That is
              a disappointing scenario, given that people with Asperger’s
              syndrome have several occupational strengths that make them
              excellent workers.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In recognising the need to care for children
              with autistic spectrum disorders, it follows that we must have
              professional care that can be delivered by those who are
              specifically trained to support individuals with those disorders.
              Only then will children benefit from the support of staff who have
              appropriate knowledge and experience of teaching children with an
              autistic spectrum disorder, and specialist training must be
              provided for teaching and support staff who work with autistic
              children. I support the motion.</p>

              an-suim ag móran Comhaltaí san ábhar.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is féidir uathachas a aithint ar chomharthaí
              luatha lagaithe i sóisialú agus i gcumarsáid agus ar an
              iompraíocht athchleachtach. Cuimsíonn an speictream mí-eagair

              eile atá ar ard-fheidhmiú, ar a dtugtar Siondróm Asperger.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful that Mr Byrne has provided an
              opportunity to discuss the introduction of autism screening for
              pre-school children and the provision of services to meet their
              needs. Autism is of considerable interest to many Members. It is
              defined by early signs of impairments, socialisation and
              communication difficulties and repetitive behaviour. Autistic
              spectrum disorders affect children of varying intellectual ability
              and impairment — from the severely impaired to those with
              high-functioning autism, termed Asperger’s Syndrome.
              Approximately one third of children with autism appear to lose
              skills in their second year, but the significance of the cause and
              life course of the disorder is unclear.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As stated again and again during the debate,
              the consensus among experts on autistic spectrum disorders is that
              early diagnosis and support are of great importance if the best
              outcome is to be achieved. Autism can manifest itself before the
              age of two and can be identified in some children at that early
              age. However, some children may not be diagnosed early because of
              the variability in the onset and severity of the condition.
              Several tests can be used to screen for different types of autism,
              including CHAT, the checklist for autism in toddlers, and DISCO,
              the diagnostic interview for social and communication disorders.
              Those tests can be useful in certain cases, but no one test is
              reliable for all autistic spectrum disorders.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Missing genuine difficulties or raising
              unnecessary worries are serious problems. For that reason, several
              studies in diagnostic screening procedures have been carried out.
              In March 2001, the Department of Health in London commissioned the
              Medical Research Council (MRC) to provide it with a clear picture
              of what scientific research has revealed about the epidemiology
              and causes of autism. The MRC report of December 2001 states that</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;To date, there is no screening instrument
              that would identify all and only those children with ASDs&quot;.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">‘Health for All Children’ is the periodic
              report of the joint working party on child health surveillance.
              The current draft of the fourth edition states that</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Formal screening for learning
              disabilities, developmental delay and cerebral palsy are not
              currently recommended&quot;.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reference was made in the debate to the
              National Initiative for Autism: Screening and Assessment (NIASA).
              For the past 15 months, it has been examining screening, diagnosis
              and early interventions for autism. Its view is that there is no
              adequate screening tool for autism. Therefore, it could not
              recommend the introduction of screening.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Figures on the prevalence of autism vary
              according to the criteria applied. Therefore, I must treat with
              caution some of the figures that were referred to today. Those
              supplied by health and social services boards in September 2001
              show that 732 children were known to trusts as having been
              diagnosed with an autistic spectrum disorder. Although there has
              been some increase in prevalence — the exact levels and causes
              of which require further research — there is no definitive
              evidence of an increasing incidence of autism in children. The
              increased professional awareness and higher public profile
              referred to in the debate may be contributing factors to the rise
              in public awareness of the condition, which may in turn lead to an
              illusion or suggestion of a higher prevalence rate when that is
              not the case.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The child health surveillance programme
              monitors the development of babies and pre-school children and is
              the primary means of early identification of impairments in
              development. However, some children may not be identified early
              because of the variability in the onset and severity of the
              condition. Given that autism affects communication and behaviour,
              it is difficult to identify the condition before children reach
              the age of two, when impairments begin to become noticeable.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, behavioural communication impairments
              may not become apparent until a child has started school. The
              school health service, therefore, has a key role in identifying
              developmental disorders in school-age children, and it can refer
              children to a range of professionals, including speech therapists
              and child or educational psychologists. In that regard, education
              professionals work closely with their counterparts in health and
              social services.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If a child is identified as having autistic
              tendencies by a health visitor or other healthcare professional,
              he or she will be referred to relevant clinicians for formal
              diagnosis. That will trigger a referral to the appropriate health
              and social services and support, including that provided by
              voluntary organisations such as PAPA. I take this opportunity to
              add my praise and thanks to that of others for the work of the
              voluntary organisations, as well as those working in the service.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department sponsored a diagnostic scoping
              study that was carried out by PAPA and the University of Ulster
              between June 1997 and December 1998. The purpose of the study was
              to evaluate the effectiveness of diagnostic provision for people
              with autistic spectrum disorders and their families, and to make
              recommendations for the enhancement of service provision. The key
              principle is that diagnosis should take place as early as possible
              in the child’s life to sustain the family’s adaptation to the
              outcome of the diagnosis and to maximise and enhance the child’s
              developmental potential. The report on the study was issued to
              health and social services boards to inform service development.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Healthcare professionals’ awareness of autism
              and autistic spectrum disorders has increased significantly in
              recent years and continues to do so. We are committed to
              developing that understanding further. The improved understanding
              is resulting in better diagnosis, which, in turn, is informing
              service development. For its part, PAPA has been instrumental in
              rolling out the treatment and education of autistic and related
              communication handicapped children (TEACCH) education programme.
              It has also provided important awareness training for professional
              healthcare staff. Health visitors and school nurses receive autism
              awareness training through a one-year postgraduate course at the
              University of Ulster. Training is not currently provided in the
              early detection of autism. However, as part of the standard
              five-year review, a group that is made up of community nurses,
              nurse managers and representatives from the University of Ulster
              and the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety,
              is examining the content of the curriculum. The issues raised
              during the debate will be fed into that review.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Iris Robinson asked about autistic adults.
              Service provision is made through the community learning
              disability services.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the weight of research evidence
              on the safety of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, the
              World Health Organization, the Medical Research Council, the
              Medicine Safety Committee and the Joint Committee on Vaccination
              and Immunisation have all stated that there is no link between the
              MMR vaccine and autism. I have seen no credible evidence to the
              contrary. The Medicine Safety Committee and the Joint Committee on
              Vaccination and Immunisation also advised recently that the MMR
              vaccine is safer than giving the vaccines separately. Our Chief
              Medical Officer wrote to GPs and other healthcare professionals in
              February to update advice on handling parental concerns. The
              purpose of the letter was to update professionals on the most
              recent studies on the MMR vaccine and to assure them that the
              Department and independent medical experts remain convinced that
              the vaccine is both safe and the most effective way to protect
              children from measles, mumps and rubella.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Byrne raised a point about applied behaviour
              analysis, which is one of many interventions that have been
              suggested as beneficial for people with autism. Various elements
              of behavioural therapy are already being used by healthcare
              professionals in that field. Although it is recognised that
              behavioural therapy can be beneficial, the particular intervention
              used is determined by a clinical judgement based on the assessed
              needs of the child. I am not aware of the case that Mr Byrne
              mentioned, so he may wish to write to me about that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Education’s task force on
              autism took evidence from boards and trusts, rather than formally
              involve the Department. The report will be out for debate, and I
              look forward to that. I reiterate that healthcare professionals
              accept the need for early diagnosis and intervention, as has been
              stressed here.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Annie Courtney asked about support for PAPA. In
              the last three financial years, departmental support for PAPA has
              totalled £239,000. The Department has provided the project
              funding for the diagnostic scoping study, and will consider any
              funding proposals submitted by PAPA. Of course, these will go
              alongside other proposals.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The health and social services boards are
              reporting on developments in services for children with autism,
              and these are being progressed on a board basis. One of my
              Department’s priorities for action requires boards and trusts to
              continue to develop therapy provision to reduce waiting times for
              children’s and adults’ services. We will continue to monitor
              developments in screening, and review current arrangements in the
              light of positive developments. Officials are involved in
              discussions with PAPA about how additional awareness training for
              healthcare professionals might be provided. The care and
              development of children with autism is a shared responsibility
              across a number of Departments, and a holistic approach will offer
              a better and brighter future for these children, which is an
              absolute commitment on all our parts.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Ramsey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I
              thank and commend Joe Byrne for tabling this motion. John Kelly
              and I proposed our amendment because there is no widely accepted,
              credible tool for universal mass screening. Other Members pointed
              out that autism has been brought to the fore lately, and that the
              issue has been raised with political parties. With that in mind, I
              commend PAPA and other groups for placing autism not only at the
              top of the political agenda, but at the top of the general agenda.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome yesterday’s announcement by the
              Minister of Education that videos will be developed and produced
              for the parents of children with autism and dyslexia, and that a
              CD-ROM will be provided for their teachers. He also said that the
              Centre for Cross Border Studies would engage a special education
              teacher on secondment to organise and facilitate a jointly funded
              programme designed to promote dialogue and co-operation among
              professionals in the field, which is key.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People want a statement. It is on record that
              the four reports that the task group has commissioned highlight
              the need for the training of classroom teachers to identify
              children who may have an autistic spectrum disorder or dyslexia,
              to address their difficulties, and to meet their needs. The
              reports also point out the importance of the involvement of
              parents in the assessment of their children’s difficulties, and
              the training of parents in suitable approaches to meeting their
              children’s needs, so that a continuity of care and learning
              approach can be provided throughout the child’s day. That ties
              in with our amendment. We are calling for early intervention.
              Health visitors, nursery schoolteachers and school nurses should
              be involved in early intervention. Key to our amendment is that by
              providing this crucial training and development of health
              visitors, school nurses, Key Stage 1 teachers and nursery
              teachers, we would create a framework of individual assessment
              that would be much more effective in detecting autism.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also vital to provide resources to meet
              the needs of people with autism and their families — that is
              what people want, it is what parents want, and what the groups are
              telling us is needed. The key requirement is early intervention,
              and I agree with Bob Coulter, who has first-hand knowledge of
              autism, that the amendment goes further than the original motion.
              We do not need, and cannot allow, children to fall out of the loop
              by creating false positives or negatives. The recent cases of
              inaccurate screening for breast cancer and of misdiagnosed breast
              cancer in Hammersmith Hospital should make us all cautious. There
              is no universally, accepted issue about mass screening.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.30 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members have spoken about a joined-up
              approach, which is key. We need a joined-up approach from the
              Department of Education and the Department of Health, Social
              Services and Public Safety. That is exactly what our amendment is
              about. There is no point saying that we need this and that, when
              the motion calls for only one Department to provide what is
              needed. The Department of Education and the Department of Health,
              Social Services and Public Safety must get together; one has as
              much responsibility as the other.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree wholeheartedly with Annie Courtney that
              the professionals need to be trained to identify the problems.
              That is the key point of our amendment. I commend Joe Byrne for
              tabling the motion, and I do not want to take away from that.
              However, our amendment takes it a small step further. It puts the
              onus not only on the Department of Health, Social Services and
              Public Safety, but on the Department of Education, which is
              crucial. I urge Members to support the amendment.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Byrne:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The debate is timely, because many parents and
              children suffer as a result of this disability. They feel that
              they are on their own and are not being taken seriously,
              especially by the health authorities. My reason for tabling this
              motion is that many children and parents are suffering. This has
              been a neglected disability for many years.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want a screening system to be introduced
              because there must be a more formal process of diagnosing those
              children who suffer from autism. The current system is too
              haphazard. I accept the amendment’s sentiments; it is trying to
              address the issue of training. However, I would not want the
              amendment to be an escape clause, for we would be failing the
              people who want us to seriously address the issue.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is completely unfair that families who
              suspect that their child has major behavioural problems feel that
              they must seek a private medical consultation with autism experts.
              There is something wrong with our healthcare system if we neglect
              those parents who feel that they need that due attention. That is
              why I chose carefully the words of the motion. I accept that all
              who have spoken during the debate have done so in good faith. They
              are genuinely concerned about the problem and want to try to
              improve the situation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">John Kelly made the case for the amendment. He
              said that early diagnosis is the crucial issue — a point that
              was emphasised by several other Members. Parents are seeking
              reassurance on that issue. They want early diagnosis so that
              intervention and treatment can occur. Bob Coulter brought
              real-life experience to the debate when he spoke about how he has
              witnessed the problems of children who suffer from this
              disability. I was encouraged by his words, and I accept the
              sentiments and the content of his speech.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bob Coulter and other Members praised the work
              of PAPA. It has been in existence for only 12 years in Northern
              Ireland, yet it has highlighted this difficulty and disability in
              a co-ordinated way. I pay tribute to those who are involved in
              voluntary organisations like PAPA, who are trying to highlight the
              problems and issues. They seek to bring it to the attention of the
              authorities that help is required.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Iris Robinson also supported the sentiments
              of the motion and made reference to autistic adults. There is a
              feeling that they are often abandoned. In particular, elderly
              parents worry about what will happen to their adult autistic son
              or daughter. They worry about who will look after their child when
              they die.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is ongoing debate about which diagnostic
              technique to use. I am not entering that debate, but I hope that
              the Health Department will not cop out because it feels that no
              definitive technique of screening exists.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is not a time for cop out. I appeal to the
              Minister to see that her Department takes the issue seriously and
              gets involved in co-ordinating the efforts of the health boards
              and trusts across Northern Ireland. The people of Tyrone and
              Fermanagh should not be neglected. I know people in Belfast who
              have had to fight very hard, and attend case meetings, to try to
              get people to take the issue seriously.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Parents are annoyed because they feel that they
              must fight and agitate. They often feel that the medical
              professionals doubt their sincerity when they try to get them to
              take the issue seriously. I support the National Health Service,
              but I find it intolerable that people must resort to private
              medical consultation.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One reason for tabling the motion was to give
              Members an opportunity to comment on a report provided for a
              Department in the local Administration that has generated the most
              widespread contributions and responses from Members and from
              people in our constituencies.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I receive four or five letters every day from
              people who are concerned about the Burns Report and the way in
              which the Minister intends to use it to follow his narrow
              socialist agenda. Despite assurances from the Minister — and
              there have been many — that he has not made his mind up on the
              issue, and that he wishes to listen to the consultations and the
              responses to the consultations, he is clearly on record, from the
              first day that he took the job, as saying what he intends to do.
              He described the selection process as &quot;inhumane&quot; —
              something that many of us took with a pinch of salt, given that it
              came from someone who carried out, and who directed others to
              carry out, some of the most inhumane actions in Northern Ireland
              in the past 30 years.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the Minister spoke to the Council for
              Catholic Maintained Schools (CCMS) recently, he said that academic
              selection must go. That was hardly the view of someone approaching
              the subject with an open mind. Hence, widespread concern exists in
              the community that a Minister, because of the system in the
              Assembly, can make decisions for which he need not account. He can
              impose his will on the education system in Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have no doubt about what the Minister intends
              to do; he has made that clear. He intends to destroy the existing
              system as systematically and as totally as he and his compatriots
              destroyed the centre of Londonderry when he was the commander of
              the IRA there. The Burns Report has provided him with educational
              Semtex with which he intends to destroy the system. I am not sure
              about Mr Burns’s intention; however, I know what the Minister’s
              intention is, because he has made it clear.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a public outcry, and desperation is
              creeping into the Minister’s actions as he goes around looking
              for support. He is a man who knows that his day is going. He will
              be Minister for only one more year, and I assure the House that,
              come the next election, when the DUP is the biggest party in the
              Assembly, neither Martin McGuinness nor any of his compatriots
              will be in the Northern Ireland Executive. Unlike David Trimble,
              when we say that we shall not have terrorists in Government, we
              mean that we shall not have terrorists in Government.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is urgency about the task that the
              Minister has set himself. He is now trying to go on the offensive.
              A massive propaganda campaign is under way, which would have done
              Joseph Goebbels proud, in which £600,000 of taxpayers’ money is
              being used to produce 15,000 videos and to circulate pamphlets to
              every household in Northern Ireland that outlines the Minister’s
              case for destroying the education system. The pamphlet is not a
              balanced piece of work; it is full of inaccuracies. However, it
              has been paid for by taxpayers’ money. I have no doubt that,
              should the Minister feel that the pamphlet is not going to
              convince people, the IRA/Sinn Féin election machine will go into
              business, and there will be multiple collections of forms to
              ensure that the outcome that he wants for his mini-referendum is
              achieved.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I could say much about the Burns Report, but I
              shall leave some items to other Members for comment. Let us look
              at issues such as the collegiate system, with the levels of
              bureaucracy that that will entail. There will be a board of
              principals; a collegiate support centre; a collegiate liaison
              council and a collegiate standing conference. We are heading down
              a road in education that is being disparaged in health, where
              there are levels of bureaucracy in the form of trusts. Almost
              every week in the Assembly I hear people railing against such
              bureaucracy.</p>

              entire debate in itself. The costing issue has been dismissed by

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Burns Report states:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We propose that transport assistance
              should be provided to any suitable school within the Collegiate
              which is designated as the ‘local Collegiate’.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That could multiply the transport budget by
              five, and yet no indication is given of that. That is a whole
              debate at which we must look. However, Burns’s contention that
              we should end academic selection is central to it all. The
              Minister has tried to portray this as ending selection, but that
              is a fraud, because Burns does not say that. Burns says that he
              wishes to see an end to academic selection, but he then goes on to
              say that schools will be oversubscribed for a long time and that
              there will have to be some selection criteria for those schools.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Burns states that that selection criteria
              will be fairer because they will be based on parental choice.
              However, as some schools will be oversubscribed, it stands to
              reason that parental choice will be a fraud because parents will
              not have a free choice. That is why he then had to introduce all
              kinds of social criteria, not academic criteria. The most damning
              social criterion of all is a pupil’s proximity to the school. He
              said that it would be used only as a last resort. Most principals
              whom I have spoken to have said that the first three criteria —
              parental choice, siblings at the school and whether your parent is
              a teacher at the school — would leave about 95% of the places
              undecided. Therefore, it will come down to where a pupil lives or
              whether a special case can be made.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Believe me, when it comes to making special
              cases, people who are socially advantaged will have the advantage,
              not the people who are socially deprived. Those who are socially
              advantaged can get reports from consultant psychologists. We shall
              not move away from selection, but we shall move away from
              selection that is based on ability and the best educational route
              for a youngster to selection that is based on social standing. If
              any Member believes that the socially deprived have a better
              chance under a selection system that depends on their social
              standing, they must live in the clouds. We shall not have a fair
              system, despite the fact that all the arguments that the Minister
              has advanced are about the system being fairer.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The most bizarre argument that I have heard
              from the Minister is that he now wishes to become the champion of
              working-class Protestant children. It is a pity that he did not
              think about that 30 years ago when he was blowing them up,
              shooting them and making them orphans. Anyone who believes that
              Martin McGuinness is concerned about the well-being of Protestant
              children from working class backgrounds needs their head felt.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The other argument is that our system has
              failed. Mr Burns makes that argument, and the Minister repeats it
              parrot-like ad infinitum — some people would say ad nauseam. The
              Minister seems to revise his opinion all the time; yesterday he
              said that we are not as good at the top end as we should be, and
              we are no good at the bottom end. He tells us that he was
              deprived, that he was denied a good education, and that that is
              why he had to become a butcher boy; of course, he then moved on to
              being a master butcher. However, I would have thought that at
              least he could have understood his press statements and the
              answers that he has given to the House. If he did not understand
              them, perhaps his officials could have explained them to him.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister said in a press release that he
              was delighted that schools in Northern Ireland were improving
              their performance and that year 12 pupils who got five or more
              GCSEs had risen to 56% this year. That figure was better than in
              England or Wales, where only 48% of students reached that
              standard. According to his press release, we do better at the top
              end. He gave an answer to my friend, Mr Weir, less than a month
              ago, and I am sure that his short-term memory cannot be that bad.
              He said that when it comes to the bottom end, we have done better
              than Scotland, England or Wales over the past five years with
              regard to the number of students who leave school without any GCSE
              qualifications. Therefore, where is this nonsense coming from that
              we have a system, which tries to slot people in according to what
              is best for them educationally, that hurts the very good students,
              the very bad students or those in between? That is not the case on
              the basis of the figures that he has provided to the House and to
              the public.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Children have different abilities and aptitudes
              and need different educational experiences, which, ironically, Mr
              Burns talks about in his guiding principles. Youngsters’
              abilities are different and varied, yet the Minister wants to fit
              them all into schools that cater for all abilities. He cannot have
              it both ways. If one says that children have different aptitudes,
              skills and academic ability — and they have — one must have
              different routes open to them. The alternative is to take the
              discredited system, which was introduced in England in the 1960s,
              that says that everyone should go to the same kind of school,
              supposedly in the interests of equality, for exactly the same
              training in spite of their differing abilities.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Member agree that the present system
              of education on the mainland is withdrawing from the comprehensive
              system and passively recognising that it has been a failure?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr S Wilson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They use the words of the Prime Minister’s
              adviser that the system, which the Minister and Mr Burns wish to
              impose in Northern Ireland, is &quot;bog standard&quot;. The
              Minister takes his socialism to the nth degree when he says:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Equality in my view does not just mean
              equality of opportunity, it means the equality of outcome.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does that mean that everyone must leave school
              with 15 GCSE A-grade passes, or that everyone must leave school
              with a mediocre education? That is the only meaning that I can
              take from that statement, and that is what is driving his agenda.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Burns talks about the pupil profile, which
              would include more than simply academic ability and testing, and
              says that that should be available to all parents. I have a couple
              of difficulties with that. First, there is no evidence that it
              will advantage the people it is supposed to advantage. When we had
              this in the 1960s, it was found to be even more socially divisive
              because it fell down when it came to extracurricular activities.
              Many middle-class parents can provide more support for youngsters
              than parents from working-class areas, where there is not the same
              income to support a wide variety of experience — dancing
              classes, music classes, et cetera.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must be careful if we go down that route. If
              we want to measure the wide ability of youngsters — their
              sporting talent, their musical, dramatic or artistic talents —
              that is fair enough. However, objective testing is still required
              and puts everyone on a level keel. That testing leaves teachers
              less open to the accusation of favouritism, and in an age of
              litigation leaves teachers less open to court action. Teachers
              would be forced to be the sole arbiters of those pupil profiles,
              and they would be mad to go down that route. Outside objective
              testing is required, and whether that is done over a long period
              with less intrusive tests or as one test a year in each of the
              final three years, it does not matter. However, the principle of
              having outside testing is an important one.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no point in the reports, when
              available, going only to the parents; they must also be made
              available to the receiving schools. The argument against that in
              the Burns Report is that that will put teachers under undue
              pressure. However, the report later states that once the schools
              received the reports, they could be used to stream youngsters.
              Where is the logic in that? If the reports are to be used by the
              schools to stream the youngsters, why do the schools not have them
              in the first place? Moreover, how do the schools protect the
              teachers by saying that the reports are only used after the
              youngsters are admitted, when they can be used to stream them?
              That does not make sense. It is important that the parents should
              have sight of the reports with an objective measured by some
              outside agency. The schools should also receive the reports.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another argument is that the selection
              procedure fails youngsters. If the Minister believes that, it
              shows his academic shallowness. Is it so that suddenly, when
              children reach the age of 10, in the month of November when they
              do the tests, they move from being successes to being failures?
              Academic and educational failure has its origins long before
              children ever sit a test — failure sometimes takes root shortly
              after birth. The environment into which they are born or their
              early years in school may affect them. The problem needs to be
              addressed then and not by scrapping the means of testing
              youngsters to see the best way forward for post-primary education.
              I did want to mention post-primary schools, but I am sure that
              other Members will do that later in the debate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Burns Report is a recipe for disaster. In
              the hands of the Minister of Education it is a dangerous weapon. I
              hope that the Minister will not try to bypass the Assembly when
              making decisions on the subject and that the Assembly will show
              good balance and common sense when making its judgement.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad to have the opportunity to
              participate in this important debate. Members have had the chance
              to consider in detail the proposals in the Burns Report, and they
              can now comment on them and offer constructive criticism.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ulster Unionist Party has several concerns
              about the proposals and is therefore unable to endorse them. It is
              considering the recommendations in detail and analysing their
              potential impact on education in Northern Ireland. However, it
              will be making more workable recommendations for education, and it
              encourages full participation in the consultation process.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main proposals of the Burns Report can be
              outlined as follows: an end to the transfer tests; the prohibition
              of academic selection for grammar schools; the possible closure of
              up to 40 schools — a worrying prospect that would have a
              serious, adverse impact, especially on rural areas; the
              development of pupil profiles; the requirement of all schools to
              use the same specified admission criteria; and the creation of
              networks of post-primary schools.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The basic conclusion of the Burns Report is the
              introduction of a comprehensive system of education. The report
              places much emphasis on the need to ensure that there will be
              equity among schools and pupils. However, it does that at the
              expense of a sharp examination of our schools’ standards and how
              they might be improved. That lack of focus on objective standards
              and the failure to explain how the proposals would raise standards
              are serious shortfalls.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most people accept that there are problems with
              the transfer test. However, the recommendation that academic
              selection should end is also unacceptable. That sort of approach
              would inevitably lead to the creation of a comprehensive system of
              education, and it is disingenuous of the report’s supporters to
              argue otherwise.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One problem is that it is doubtful that there
              is support for a comprehensive system. Parents’ views must be
              considered, and the report contains no evidence to support the
              view that such a system would improve standards overall. The
              experience of the comprehensive system in GB suggests that the
              reverse is true. It would be ironic if Northern Ireland were to
              establish a comprehensive system, when GB is attempting to move
              away from that failed system.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The establishment of pupil profiles is
              sensible; however, receiving schools must be able to view them.
              What is the use of such profiles if they cannot be used to help
              place pupils in the most appropriate schools? The Burns admission
              criteria also show a lack of understanding of how the system is
              likely to work. I believe that they would lead ultimately to
              selection by postcode. The report appears to overlook the fact
              that once distance is a prime consideration, that will exacerbate
              the problems of oversubscription. At present oversubscription is
              limited because it is known that some pupils are likely to be
              admitted to popular schools, so it is incorrect to argue that
              distance will come into play only as a last resort tie-breaker,
              and the Assembly must consider that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the creation of collegiates, it is desirable
              to have closer co-operation between neighbouring schools. However,
              the problem rests with the report’s view that the arrangements
              will be central to the system and will create, in size and
              composition, a system that is so bureaucratic that it will not
              work practically. It must also be stressed that there is no
              experience, internationally or otherwise — there is not even a
              pilot scheme — on which to base a collegiate system. It is worth
              noting that, given the announcement made by the Northern Catholic
              bishops last week, the collegiate proposal contained in the Burns
              report is dead in the water.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister is mishandling the consultation
              process that he instigated. It is no longer being conducted in a
              fair and equitable manner. Unfortunately, officials in the
              Department of Education appear to have allowed themselves to
              become mere cheerleaders for the type of education system
              advocated by the Minister and his party. That goes beyond their
              remit and is not acceptable. The video that was produced by the
              Department, and the household pamphlet that is in the making, are
              clear examples of the lack of impartiality shown by the
              Department, which will not assist the proper consideration and
              resolution of this important issue. In relation to the household
              pamphlet, provision should be made for granting public funds to
              allow groups that are opposed to those ill-thought-out proposals
              to put their alternative proposals to parents, thus preserving
              objectivity.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are many more issues; however, time does
              not permit me to address them. I want to apologise to Sammy
              Wilson, who proposed the motion, because I may not be able to stay
              until the end of this important debate. There is no discourtesy
              intended.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Lewsley:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that people realise that
              Northern Ireland needs an education system that is effective and
              well-resourced. We need a system that is open, inclusive, flexible
              enough to cater for all needs, and responsive to the society that
              it serves. It is vital that there be a new all-ability system to
              offer education on an inclusive basis, guaranteeing equality of
              opportunity for all.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been much opposition to selection, on
              the grounds that the system is unfair, divisive, ineffective and
              damaging to children and society. I acknowledge the benefits that
              were brought about when the 11-plus was introduced. In a post-war
              society, in which standard education finished at age 14, it opened
              the door to secondary-level education for a new generation of
              children. However, we are now in the twenty-first century, and the
              system must be adapted to reflect the needs of modern society.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I broadly welcome the Burns Report. However, I
              have reservations that I will refer to later. In general, the
              principle and objectives of the report reflect the intention to
              develop a high-quality education system that will allow each young
              person to develop his or her full potential and will reflect the
              value of each child. The report acknowledges the untold damage
              that was inflicted on generations of children by inaccurate
              testing, artificial segregation and damage to fragile
              self-confidence. The assessment that the current system is
              inflexible, fragmented, wasteful of valuable resources and lacks
              equality of opportunity is valid also.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a compelling case for the fundamental
              reform of transfer procedures from primary to post-primary
              schools. My office has received numerous letters from parents, all
              agreeing that the 11-plus should be abolished and that academic
              selection for 11-year-olds should end. There is also broad support
              for increased emphasis on choice. That can be seen as a positive
              step towards equality and can bring benefits in human terms by
              reducing the damage to self-esteem.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, as I said before, I have concerns
              about equality of opportunity and parity of esteem. There is still
              an apparent intention to retain distinct types of schools that
              tend towards more vocational studies. I have reservations about
              categorising 11-year-old children in that way, even if it is not
              intended to be fixed or final. The proposals to broaden options at
              post-14 years should help to improve parity of esteem, though it
              may be difficult to change attitudes while retaining distinctive
              pathways from age 11.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also concerned that, despite all the good
              intentions, streaming in line with social and economic
              backgrounds, rather than individual preference or potential, will
              still occur. That is backed up by European evidence that academic
              school populations are made up of children from better-off
              backgrounds. The high academic standards of the present can be
              maintained and offered to more children through the teaching of
              11- to 18-year-olds together, alongside improved vocational and
              social development.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report recommends change. It is at the
              consultation stage, and nothing has been set in stone. That is why
              this debate is important. It is also important that grammar
              schools should not feel threatened or cause panic in the community
              by informing parents that their children will not be eligible for
              entrance under the new criteria. The main principles behind the
              report should be increased opportunity and choice for all. The
              review body has been most thorough in dealing with issues such as
              the transfer to post-primary education and the incorporation of
              the wide-ranging needs of young people in schools.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McHugh:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I
              welcome the opportunity to speak on the Burns Report, even though
              it is the second time that the matter has been raised. We could go
              over the old arguments ad infinitum, but that would not change who
              says what in the House. I thought that we were having some impact
              on the Chairperson and the Deputy Chairperson of the Education
              Committee by agreeing that there was a need for change in
              education and that people want that change. That is open to debate
              and disagreement.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Burns Report has taken us to a new level in
              the education debate in that we now have a way of finding the
              change that meets present needs, rather than those of 40 or 50
              years ago. It must be done; people agree that it must be done,
              including teachers and parents. That fundamental point must be
              addressed. Some parents in some areas are not being addressed by
              their Assembly representatives. The situation has not changed over
              the past 50 years or more.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This debate is about equality and giving a
              voice to everyone, especially the most vulnerable and the most
              disadvantaged in our society. Research by Gallagher and Smith on
              the impact of academic selection has clearly shown that there is a
              strong correlation between the transfer test and a child’s
              socio-economic status. The percentage of grammar school pupils who
              are entitled to free school meals ranges from a fraction of one
              per cent to around twenty-five per cent. In secondary schools it
              ranges from 20% to 70%. In other words, of all post-primary pupils
              who are entitled to free school meals, 15% are in grammar schools
              and 85% are in other schools.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.15 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several arguments are made in favour of grammar
              schools. It is said that they offer opportunities for able
              children to succeed irrespective of socio-economic status.
              However, the main indicator of socio-economic status is the
              percentage of pupils who are entitled to free school meals, which
              offers stark and startling evidence to the contrary. It is argued
              that selection is made on the grounds of academic excellence, not
              according to a pupil’s socio-economic background. Schools,
              representatives and others should note the evidence that the
              poorest children in the Western Education and Library Board and
              South-Eastern Education and Library Board areas are between five
              and 10 times more likely to be in a school other than a grammar
              establishment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another argument is that significant numbers of
              children from poorer backgrounds attend grammar schools; that is
              not so. Academic selection and greater affluence are closely and
              inextricably linked. The argument that a comprehensive system
              would lead to selection by postcode is arrogant and hypocritical.
              The polarisation by postcode, as evidenced by the figures, is
              astounding.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That grammar schools ensure high standards of
              academic excellence for few is dramatically outlined in these and
              other figures. Grammar schools are not for the many, and, in
              particular, they are not for children from poorer backgrounds. The
              argument is for the preservation of privilege; it is not for the
              equalisation of opportunity.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People claim that grammar schools serve
              communities well and that children from poorer backgrounds are
              admitted to them. In neither case is that true, and that is
              especially so regarding children from the Protestant community.
              Who is representing the Protestant children from the areas that I
              mentioned?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A point was made about the Minister’s
              concern. The Minister is concerned about children in all areas. Do
              those who purport to support grammar schools and academic-based
              selection represent everyone in their constituencies? Do they
              represent people in deprived areas? Do they represent those who
              vote for them in the matter of education, given the figures that I
              have outlined? People in such areas would agree that they have
              certainly not been represented over the past 50 years. The problem
              is that people have voted along sectarian lines and have failed to
              use their votes to help themselves educationally.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem is academic-based selection. People
              have been carried along by the arguments made today by Sammy
              Wilson and others, without examining the subject in detail. It is
              important that the issue be debated in such a way as to bring us
              into a new era, and that it should not be about simply sticking to
              the same old sectarian lies.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Parents, particularly those from deprived
              areas, need to examine the arguments closely. There are deprived
              areas in many of the constituencies of Members who purport to
              represent people as MLAs. People must look closely at what will be
              best for their children’s future. What will represent the best
              future for all children, not just the few? Do the representatives
              of the 8% who attend grammar schools from deprived areas,
              particularly TSN areas, represent all children in those areas
              properly? Are they representing the few elitist groups who are
              pushing them harder in this debate? Go raibh maith agat.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs E Bell:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The debate is opportune as there is obviously
              an interest among the public. However, I was concerned and
              disappointed by some of Sammy Wilson’s speech. Like many
              Members, I have been inundated with letters from parents who are
              concerned about the repercussions of the Burns Report and its
              implementation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last October, I said on behalf of the Alliance
              Party that we welcomed the Burns Report as a basis for studying
              alternatives to the discredited 11-plus transfer procedure, but
              that we were — even then — concerned about implementing it in
              its entirety.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are practical problems with the setting
              up of collegiates, which would, it is hoped, provide a flexible
              education system that would benefit all children. The advantage of
              such a system is that it would require real working together if it
              were to be a success for all pupils. The one thing that was
              generally agreed by most people is that the 11-plus is an
              inequitable system that divides children at an unnecessarily early
              age into successes and failures. We must make it a priority that,
              whatever comes out of this report, the trauma and tension for
              pupils, parents and teachers should become a thing of the past.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The new system must be flexible enough to allow
              all children, with the help of teachers and parents, to be able,
              at a responsible stage — not during the transfer from primary to
              post-primary education — to make their own decisions about their
              educational future. That could be regarded as personal selection,
              but one that is made with the knowledge of ones capabilities and
              aspirations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Alliance Party will be making its
              submission, as will other parties, after we have studied in detail
              this report with the party’s education group. It will then be
              approved by the party council, so I will not make specific
              comments. However, our view is that a qualifying entrance test
              should not be the method of transfer. Also, more investment should
              be made, whatever the system, in nursery education. Closer
              attention could be paid to the integrated system, which the
              Alliance Party feels is inclusive, and which could be seen as a
              possible pilot scheme to show the impact of the abolition of the
              11-plus in Northern Ireland. We will be discussing the appropriate
              number of collegiates, because there may not be a need for so
              many. We will be looking at practicalities such as transport —
              the transfer between schools depending on the curriculum subjects
              that a child chooses. We should not throw out the good aspects of
              secondary and grammar schools that have existed until now, but we
              must ensure that all children are allowed to make their own free
              choices with the acceptance of parents and the advice of teachers.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to read part of one of the many letters
              that I received in support of grammar schools. The writer
              concludes:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;I feel that grammar schools should remain
              an essential and integral part of any future educational system
              and should not be seen as an elite institution catering for a few,
              but should be seen as part of a system combining academic,
              vocational and technical training so that the needs and abilities
              of all children are met. In addition, greater freedom of movement
              between the different types of schools should be possible so that
              all pupils can achieve their full potential&quot;.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I, and the party’s education group, see no
              problem with that, and we will be examining the matter.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I said earlier, there are questions to be
              asked. The Minister will be aware of them. We must know where the
              money for that will come from. There are worries about the capital
              programme and other budgets. Last week the Education Committee was
              deliberating over the bids. So, where will the money come from?
              There are worries about the pupil profiles. There is also a very
              practical problem that we cannot escape: how will transfer between
              schools in sensitive areas be achieved so that the system works
              properly? We must also look at training and the morale of
              teachers, and the contribution of parents must not be undermined.
              It must be clarified so that they can play their part in full.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given the years of trauma that we have
              experienced, we need radical proposals that will allow modern
              society to develop. Children and education have changed, and we
              must ensure that education is in keeping with our hopes for a good
              future for our children. We should always remember that pupils
              must be the first priority. We must provide systems that will
              allow them to achieve their potential, whoever they are. That will
              mean a better future for them and for society in general. I
              support the motion.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Roche:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Burns Report has two core proposals. One
              involves the destruction of the grammar school system, the most
              successful sector of secondary education; the other involves the
              introduction of a so-called collegiate system that would
              effectively introduce comprehensive education to Northern Ireland.
              The entire thrust of the Burns Report is contrary to the best
              current educational thinking and Government policy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The argument about the transfer system —
              effectively the destruction of the grammar school sector — seems
              to be based on an aversion to academic selection, with which the
              11-plus test is identified. Therefore, it is important to ask what
              type of test it is. The current transfer test essentially examines
              English, mathematics and science. In other words, it tests
              numeracy and literacy skills and is, therefore, an examination of
              two areas of education. If pupils are not proficient in numeracy
              and literacy, they could not possibly be proficient in anything
              else, because those skills are prerequisites for any educational
              success.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland is well down the list of
              international comparisons of literacy and numeracy skills.
              However, we are not exceptional, as the same situation applies to
              the Republic and the rest of the UK. Instead of doing away with
              this type of testing and the emphasis at primary level, which is
              where we lay the basis for literacy and numeracy achievement, we
              should be trying to enhance the focus on English, science and
              mathematics as prerequisites for success at secondary and tertiary
              education.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nobody wants to say that a particular form of
              transfer that properly focuses on English and mathematics should
              not be assessed occasionally — of course it should. A cursory
              reading of the Gallagher Report shows that it failed to make any
              substantive case against the present system. Its case was based on
              anecdotal evidence, mainly from secondary school teachers who were
              expressing their disillusion and a lack of morale, rather than
              giving an objective evaluation of what the test means for
              students.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Pupils must transfer from primary to secondary
              education at some point. We can debate from now until doomsday
              about the age at which that should take place, but again the
              Gallagher Report did not mention the need for radical change. At
              11 years of age, students will have been at primary school for
              about six years; they mature earlier. By the time children have
              reached age 11, they almost certainly want to move to secondary
              education.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.30 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore, the case for abolishing the transfer
              system, with the emphasis on those prerequisites, has not been
              made. The idea that we can dismiss focus on English and
              mathematics by derogatorily categorising them as academic is
              nonsense.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The transfer test, and the fact that we must
              have a system that enables students to progress from primary
              school to secondary school in order to get the education that is
              most suited to them, is not the problem. The problem is failure in
              the non-grammar sector. The level of achievement in that sector is
              appalling. A vast number of students — probably in excess of 60%
              — leave the sector with virtually no qualifications. That must
              be addressed to ensure that children outside the grammar sector
              are placed in another secondary stream that can offer them highly
              rated vocational and technical education. If there were real
              choice for students in the secondary sector, involving highly
              rated technical education and grammar school education, the sense
              of failure associated with the current transfer system would
              disappear. I remember my primary school days. Children who left
              primary school to go to technical college were proud of that
              achievement. They felt no sense of failure.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members have mentioned social deprivation,
              which is an important issue. In looking at educational achievement
              in certain sections of the community, Members must face the fact
              that, in many areas of Northern Ireland, the family and social
              infrastructure for success in anything, including education, is
              entirely absent. Members must realise that if they decide to pour
              more money into those areas they might as well pour it into a
              bottomless pit, because they will make no significant change to
              what such people can achieve.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am intrigued by the mindset that would want
              to destroy the best in education in Northern Ireland and do
              nothing to improve the worst. I imagine that it belongs to a
              person who did not achieve anything and is determined that no one

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr B Hutchinson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for East Belfast, Mr Sammy
              Wilson, for tabling the take-note motion. Members’ discussions
              are timely. I welcome the abolition of the 11-plus. The Burns
              Report does not go far enough for my party. It is messing about
              with the idea of collegiates, while trying to keep those in
              grammar schools happy. If we are to address those issues, we need
              a comprehensive system. If we wanted to do something about
              children’s education, we would not start at age 11 — we should
              start from birth.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The previous Member to speak, Mr Roche, said
              that he would not waste money on people in socially deprived
              areas. That is not the issue. We must be concerned about the start
              that people get in life. The difficulty in society in the UK is
              that we accept that care starts at birth and finishes at age
              three, at which point the Minister of Education takes over. That
              should not be the case. There must be a seamless transition
              between care and education. People from deprived areas do not have
              the same opportunities, because not enough is done for them from
              birth to age three.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been proven in Scandinavian countries
              and elsewhere that a strategy for the years from birth to age six
              works. We should not put four-year-old children in school uniforms
              behind desks. It is submitted elsewhere that children should be
              taught how to interact through play — a measure that has not
              been adopted in our society. Failure to adopt such measures
              prevents working-class Protestants from attaining success.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whether those on the Unionist Benches like it
              or not, I know that a person brought up in my community as a
              working-class Protestant or Loyalist or Unionist — whatever you
              wish to call it — has a one-in-eight chance of going to a
              grammar school. That is a social injustice. A person brought up on
              the Falls Road as a Republican or Nationalist has a one-in-three
              chance of going to a grammar school. There is something very wrong
              with that. Are people telling me that there is something
              genetically wrong with Protestants because they cannot achieve?
              That is what Mr Roche said. Given the opportunity, those people
              could achieve as much as anyone else. However, they are not given
              that opportunity, and we must address that issue.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Burns continually mentions pupil profiles. What
              use is a pupil profile to someone from north Belfast? Some 37% of
              11-year-old Protestants in north Belfast have a reading age of
              nine. Numeracy and literacy must be dealt with between the ages of
              0 and 6. The Burns Report alone will not solve the problem —
              other measures need to happen if progress is to be made.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Primary school teachers say that when children
              begin primary school they are not ready, and they blame the
              nursery teacher. The principals of secondary schools say that when
              children begin secondary school they are not ready and that they
              have a reading age of nine, when it should be 11. We have got it
              wrong, and we must correct it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members have been talking about selection at
              the age of 11 and the evidence for its effectiveness. When Sir
              Cyril Burt introduced selection, he had only anecdotal evidence
              — he had no empirical evidence to suggest that a child should be
              tested at the age of 11. Primary education covers a child’s
              formative years, and children must work in all-ability classes.
              Primary school teachers will say that their job is to teach
              children, but secondary school teachers will say that they teach
              subjects. We have got that wrong. The children should be at the
              centre of the system — they should decide where they go after
              primary school.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have heard nonsense about grammar schools
              being vocational and everything else. Everyone in the Chamber
              knows that parents send their children to grammar schools because
              the children are academically bright and the parents want their
              children to achieve. People do not send their children to grammar
              schools to learn how to be joiners or bricklayers. Do not be
              kidded that the grammar schools will change. Those schools are
              elitist and exist for those pupils who perform best. Such schools
              do not want pupils who cannot achieve good grades or who will
              bring their results down. Grammar schools want only the best
              pupils, and we must focus on that issue.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that we look at the source of
              the problems. If we do not do that, and if we do not address the
              matter of children’s early years, we shall not win. Burns has a
              discussion on the issue, but that is all that it should be. The
              report should be used to help us to get on to the right track. We
              should look at the Burns Report — especially from a Unionist
              point of view. We could throw the report out tomorrow, but we must
              address the problem of getting children from working-class
              backgrounds to achieve. We must also remember the statistics on
              the educational achievements of Catholics and Protestants, and ask
              why Catholics are doing better.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In north Belfast, 67% of Protestant children
              who leave school at the age of 16 do not have any formal
              educational qualifications. What does that say to people in that
              society?</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That the system is a failure.</p>
              <b>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes. However, it also tells young people that
              they have no future or stake in society. We must give them both.
              That is why we are here, and we must get it right. We must find
              out why Protestants are not achieving. We cannot say that it is
              because Catholics have more brains. There is more to it than that,
              and we must look into the problem. The last thing that we need is
              to condemn another generation of Protestants or Catholics to the
              scrap heap.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should look at the Burns Report to see
              whether we can tweak it or whether we should throw it out and
              replace it with something different. We must come up with a system
              that does not have social injustice, because that is what the
              problem is about. It has nothing to do with the supposed trauma of
              the 11-plus — children can cope with sitting the 11-plus. The
              problem is that we are telling children that if they do not
              achieve, they will be put on the scrap heap. There is plenty of
              evidence of world leaders and others who did not pass such exams
              but went on to get university degrees.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a href="#top">TOP</a></p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is the third time that we have debated the
              issue of post-primary education, and rightly so, as it is probably
              one of the most important issues that will arise during this term
              of the Assembly. How we educate our children and, indeed, what
              sort of society we want in Northern Ireland should be matters of
              incalculable importance to every single Member. Already in the
              Chamber there is a sense that people care. They care in different
              ways and, of course, have different views on the subject, which is
              surely what Burns is trying to get to the bottom of.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should take the opportunity to reflect for a
              moment on the process so far. I suggest that it has been quite
              rigorous. Many comparisons were made in the reports that were
              prepared, and the Burns Report did not just base its analysis on
              what was happening in Northern Ireland. If we are to be in a
              global society, and if the Executive are about joined-up thinking,
              then it is quite right that the Burns Report looks not only at the
              UK, but at what is happening elsewhere in Europe. As a member of
              the Committee for Employment and Learning, I hear that there are
              serious issues about literacy and training. Therefore, if we are
              now talking about lifelong learning, perhaps that is what we need
              to address in post-primary education. If there are serious
              literacy problems let us address those.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Where do we start? Billy Hutchinson put forward
              some serious proposals. He talked about birth to three years of
              age, and the fact that we are sending our children to school far
              too early, which is a point that may not have been addressed
              sufficiently. Paddy Roche talked about children being at primary
              school for six years. However, some are only babies when they go
              through the school door. In other countries they would still be in
              kindergarten or nursery school, not sitting at desks with books
              and pencils being told that that is what faces them from then on.
              No wonder many want to run out the school gate. Many attend for
              the first day and, at the age of four, say: &quot;Been there, done
              that, do not want to go back.&quot; That is what the Women’s
              Coalition would have liked to look at, but the terms of reference
              were so limited that we could only consider children between the
              ages of four and 11.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have no doubt that other parties will take
              different things out of this, but in the end we must obtain some
              consensus and take most of the people with us as far as we can go.
              That is what change is all about. On that, I commend the Committee
              for Education, the Minister, and the Department for struggling
              with this issue. It is right to spend time on it, to give it a
              rigorous analysis and to come up with a genuine way forward.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Women’s Coalition has already put its
              proposals to Burns, and I am not going to reiterate them — I
              have stated what we wish to see as the way forward. We endorse
              wholeheartedly the values of excellence, equality, inclusion and
              diversity on which Burns is based. I do not say for one minute
              that we hand our teachers the problem of trying to resolve this
              conflict. As Paddy Roche, Sammy Wilson and others have said, the
              problems of inequality in this society are not based solely on
              education. We have to look at all the factors that make people
              unequal — location, housing, family circumstances. That is where
              I take issue with Paddy Roche. No matter what one thinks about
              their parents, those children must be given a chance. I disagree
              with him about deprivation. Even if the parents are prisoners, or
              have committed acts in the past, that is not the fault of the
              children. We must build a society that gives those children a
              chance, and that is what Burns is trying to do. Equally, I suggest
              that the issue of diversity is one that should enrich a society
              and add to it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Selection at the age of 11 is inappropriate.
              Others will disagree that it is unfair and discriminatory. Again,
              having listened to the points made by Paddy Roche and Sammy
              Wilson, I would suggest — and I thought that we had achieved
              some consensus in recent debates — that the test is not
              appropriate and that there must be some other way. Some Members
              may suggest that there should be another test, although others may
              suggest that it should not be taken at the age of 11. Burns
              suggested other possibilities, such as the compilation of profiles
              over several years.</p>
              <i>

              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recent experience has shown me that we are
              teaching our children tricks when we show them how to complete
              those tests. Children with good memories will remember how to do
              the tests. The tests are multiple-choice, and children do not read
              books and receive the same literacy skills as other 11-year-olds
              who do not sit the tests. Teachers will say that half the primary
              6 year and the first part of the primary 7 year are taken up with
              explaining the test to the children and having them complete tests
              over and over again until they are successful. Children who
              remember the tricks and who achieve 70% or 80% will pass; the
              others will not. The system had to change, and I thought that
              consensus was being achieved on that point.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should welcome the proposal of guided parent
              and pupil choice at the appropriate stage of young people’s
              educational careers.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our schools have not collaborated and
              co-operated in the past. Perhaps it is time for them to respond to
              the Burns proposals.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have not had enough information about
              collegiates. Perhaps the Minister would provide more information
              when he speaks later. The issue is inflammatory, both inside and
              outside the education sector. A model has been proposed, which we
              might adapt in the future. However, can collegiates inject the
              dynamism, change, co-operation and collaboration needed? The
              proposal may come up against the churches, as we have seen in the
              past few days. Teachers’ unions have risen to the challenge and
              some businesses have also pledged support. My concern is that the
              issue is bigger than political identity. I would like to know if
              the churches would support the collegiate way forward.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Change is difficult, and I have said before
              that this may be an opportunity and not a threat. We may need a
              Burns 2 — if that does not sound too painful. I do not mean a
              scalding; I mean a proper, informed way that will ensure as much
              Assembly support as possible.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Burns Report contains a series of
              half-masticated, ill-digested concepts about the nature of
              education, clothed in the garb of dreamlike utopian language that
              is as nebulous as its ideas.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The truth is that the fundamental question that
              Burns addresses, and that we should address, is: what is the basic
              function of education? Is it to do our best for the individual
              child? That would certainly be the basis for education in the
              Western liberal tradition. The corollary of that — if the
              concern is what is best for the individual child — is equality
              of opportunity. Every child should have equality of opportunity,
              according to his or her several abilities. A child from a
              middle-class family who is bright and sharp and well suited to an
              academic education should have an academic education; a child from
              a working-class ghetto should have the same opportunity.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can speak with authority on this subject,
              because I am the youngest of eight children, born in what is now
              designated a deprived area, the Shankill Road, and I lived in a
              two-up, two-down house. I passed the 11-plus examination in 1948,
              the year of its introduction. Subsequently I attended Grosvenor
              High School, which was the first local authority grammar school.
              Some 95% of the boys and girls who attended that school were from
              working-class homes; middle-class children were a rarity there,
              almost non-existent.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore, I do not buy into any of this guff
              about the Shankill Road or about why it is deprived. One reason
              that north Belfast, the Shankill Road and other areas are deprived
              is that the community structure and family commitment have broken
              down. It is due to the flight of people who, in many cases,
              observed the principles of community, church and family life, and
              who were committed to the education of their children. Much of
              what we are seeing now has been brought about by the terrorism and
              political instability generated in those areas by the Minister of
              Education’s party and, to a large extent, those whom Billy
              Hutchinson would purport to represent. That is the reason: it has
              nothing to do with the education system.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, there is another aspect to the
              subject, and it is the Minister of Education’s ideological
              drive, which is behind the Burns Report. Prof Simon, a noted
              Marxist and Communist, advanced the philosophy in the early 1960s
              that it is the purpose of education — and this brought about the
              comprehensive education system in the 1960s in the UK — to
              provide equality of results, not equality of opportunity. Equality
              of results was for the community. In Russia, it was for the state.
              People there were not educated on the basis of equal opportunity
              according to abilities; they were educated according to what the
              state required from them. People were educated on the basis of
              equality of results. That is the ideology that is driving this
              review.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Despite attempts to gloss over its results,
              comprehensive education has comprehensively failed on the mainland
              UK. It has failed in comparison with tripartite education. The
              improved GCSE results show that the biggest contribution, outside
              the grammar schools, in improvement has been from the secondary
              moderns — not from the comprehensives. When we look at a new
              system of education, we must look at one that provides equality of
              opportunity. The Burns proposals do not do so.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Children with the intellectual capacity to
              benefit from academic education should have that opportunity. They
              should have that opportunity whether they are working class,
              middle class or any other class. We are not equal. The 16-stone
              boy will never ride a Derby winner. The eight-stone, five-pound
              boy will never play in the front or second row for Ireland. Those
              are physical examples. The child with an IQ of 140 or 150 may well
              become a nuclear physicist or a neurological surgeon, but the
              child with an IQ of 80 or 90 will not.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We face a system where society has determined
              what is offered respect. Many parents would rather have their
              child working as a white-collar clerk in an insurance company when
              he has hands that can produce a Hepplewhite chair or a piece of
              Bellini silver. That is a condemnation of the values of our
              society. That is what we should be addressing. We should be
              ensuring that the academically qualified have an equal
              opportunity, and we should ensure that the child who has other
              skills and capacities for providing a real contribution to society
              should have the money, backing and educational system to allow his
              capacities to flower. Burns does not provide for that.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Weir:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is one of the most important issues that
              the Assembly has faced. Many charges have been levelled against Mr
              McCartney in his time but lack of intellectual ability has never
              been one of them. Had the Burns Report been available in 1948, Mr
              McCartney would not have gone to Grosvenor High School. It is
              doubtful whether, under the Burns Report, he would even have gone
              to a grammar school — so much for the enlightened Burns Report.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a pity that we are debating a report that
              has made such a mess of the offer that it brings for the future. I
              would describe it as a dog’s dinner, except that any discerning
              dog would be keen to avoid the mess described as the Burns Report.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Eileen Bell touched on the central issue: the
              most important point is what is in the best interests of the
              pupils. What lies behind the Burns Report, and, more importantly,
              what lies behind the Minister’s assessment of post-primary
              education, is not the best interests of the pupils, but pure and
              simple dogma. It is a desire to produce, in the Minister’s own
              words, equality of outcome rather than equality of opportunity.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Things start to go wrong when there is a
              driving dogma pushing a comprehensive system at the expense of
              what is in the best interests of pupils. At least the Minister has
              always been consistent on that point. The Burns Report even lacks
              that ideological and intellectual courage, because it tries to
              hide in a mist of proposals about collegiate systems and other
              bits of administration. It tries to disguise the fact that it is
              essentially a proposal to have comprehensive education via the
              back door. It lacks the honesty to at least argue the case for
              comprehensive education.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What are the problems that face the education
              system? They are clearly not the lack of academic achievement in
              Northern Ireland — we have been consistently above everywhere
              else in the United Kingdom. Compared with the rest of the United
              Kingdom, our system has produced the brightest and best. The
              argument has always been that, despite that, we are still
              producing the highest number of pupils with no qualifications.
              That may have been the case in the past.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the Minister’s figures — not
              figures from any pressure group — produced in response to a
              question for written answer from me, show that we now have fewer
              pupils leaving school with no qualifications than England,
              Scotland or Wales. Northern Ireland is not at the bottom end.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is it, as a general rule, a fact that kids from
              working-class backgrounds have an overall lower level of
              attainment? There is a degree of truth in that. However, the
              number of people coming from working-class backgrounds in Northern
              Ireland and going on to third-level education is the highest in
              the United Kingdom. Those are not the problems.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been identified that we have low levels
              of attainment in certain parts of the country, especially in
              working-class areas. However, the key question is whether the
              Burns Report will solve those problems or whether it will
              exacerbate them. I think that it will exacerbate them. For
              example, take the pupil profiles, which will not be made available
              to schools. The Burns Report is being driven on the wishes of
              parents, and the level of ambition that parents have for their
              children, and the amount of drive and push involved. Anyone who
              thinks that that will benefit the socially disadvantaged is not
              living in the real world.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Where will the greatest push for children to go
              to grammar schools come from? It will come from areas of
              middle-class Northern Ireland where expectations are higher, and
              where there is a certain amount of social pressure on those
              children to attain grammar school places. Pupil profiles used in
              that way would exacerbate the problem.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have not done away with selection. We have
              replaced it with selection by postcode — selection, ultimately,
              by ability to pay. The first two methods of selection are that if
              a sibling is at that grammar school, preference will be given, and
              if a child is the son or daughter of a teacher, he or she will get
              preference — presumably that is a device to keep the teaching
              unions as quiet as possible on the matter.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister, who belongs to a party that feels
              itself so much in the modern world that it decries the hereditary
              monarchy and the hereditary system that was in the House of Lords,
              wants to have a system where we have hereditary places at grammar
              schools. If a child happens to be born into the right family and
              lives close to the school, that child will gain a place in a
              grammar school.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.00 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In reality, this will introduce a comprehensive
              system by the back door. Instead of creating a new egalitarian
              society, we will witness falling standards as were seen when
              comprehensive education was introduced in England and Wales. In
              addition, several schools will become independent. Grammar schools
              will ape what has happened in England, and they will move towards
              a public school system, in which selection will not be on the
              basis of academic ability, but on the basis of ability to pay.
              That is fundamentally wrong.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I, and many like me, come from a generation
              that had the opportunity to go to grammar school. That opportunity
              was not available to the generations before us. I ask people who
              have benefited from that system not to pull the ladder up behind
              them. Do not deprive people, particularly those from working-class
              backgrounds, of the opportunity to realise their full potential.
              Reject Burns; let us preserve what is best in the current system
              and look at what changes we can make to improve that system. [<i>Interruption</i>].</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I see that I am to be a victim of your new
              declaration, Madam Deputy Speaker.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to draw to the attention of the House
              the guiding principles in the Burns Report. Those of us who see
              little merit in the report are not suggesting that the present
              system is flawless. The report’s guiding principles are great in
              theory. However, the real test is in the outworking and
              application of those principles. Most of them have been at the
              heart of our education system for many years. No one would
              disagree with the principle of an education system that is
              child-centred, values children equally and gives breadth of
              opportunity to all the skills and talents that children possess.
              However, a close study of the great vision of Burns reveals that
              the principles are not as wholesome as was first thought. The
              revolution that the Burns Report will trigger will undoubtedly
              lead to a catastrophe. For example, the report proclaims:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Each young person should be valued
              equally&quot;,</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">and that</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;There should be equality of opportunity,
              access and excellence for all.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, since the review proposals will
              potentially disadvantage the very best children academically, as
              well as most of the less able, these principles are turned on
              their head. The Burns recommendations mean that there will be less
              suitable opportunity, reduced access to the schools most suited to
              children’s needs and reduced opportunity for all sorts of
              excellence for most, if not all, children.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report states:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;All young people should be enabled to
              develop their talents to the full&quot;.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is obvious to everyone except the review
              body that owing to the impact of their new neighbourhood
              comprehensive schools, many academically able young people,
              especially those from outlying areas and the outskirts of large
              towns, will not be able to develop to the full. Equally, many
              children placed in academic schools are likely to suffer.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another guiding principle suggests that schools
              should enable children to have a commitment to lifelong learning.
              Really? Perhaps there is a lifelong love within certain
              specialisms such as reading, language and mathematics. However,
              young people have no notion of lifelong learning at ages 16 or 18.
              What type of children have the Burns review members been teaching
              in the past 10 years? It would be interesting to find out. Perhaps
              the reason for such a lack of realism in education and school
              management terms is that it would appear that not one member of
              the panel has been a practising teacher during that time. Five of
              the 11 members of the review body have never taught at all. The
              rest have only been involved indirectly in the practice of
              teaching.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report states:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Education should have regard to the
              changing needs of society and the economy.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is a partial truth.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a huge need for good doctors,
              accountants and lawyers, but there is an even greater need for
              good electricians, plumbers and mechanics. Burns does not begin
              properly to address the latter shortcoming. The notion that
              tradesmen and professionals can be developed satisfactorily side
              by side in all schools is a complete nonsense and impractical.
              That is not to value one profession higher than the other; it is
              simply to recognise a general truth that most teachers and pupils
              naturally recognise.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are many things that I want to say about
              principles, but time is passing. I refer the Assembly to a
              research booklet by Dr John Marks, an academic. The booklet is in
              the Library if anyone would like to consult it. It makes
              interesting reading. His book ‘The Betrayed Generations:
              Standards in British Schools 1950-2000’ shows how for many
              decades the comprehensive system has failed in the four parts of
              the UK to provide children with as good an education as that which
              Northern Ireland’s children have been fortunate to receive.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main findings of his research are that
              pupils in comprehensive schools make up 85% of the age group but
              they obtain 75% of good GCSE passes. At A level, the proportion of
              passes by comprehensive school pupils falls to about 65%, and the
              proportion of A grades that they gain falls to about 50%. The
              results for selective schools taken together throughout GB are
              about 35% better than those for comprehensive schools. That
              indicates substantial underachievement by many comprehensive
              schools, and perhaps a further 60,000 pupils would achieve good
              GCSEs if GB had a selective system. At GCSE level, 25% of
              comprehensive schools perform less well than the average secondary
              modern school.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for Employment
              and Learning (Dr Birnie):</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will begin by speaking as the Committee
              Chairperson. No one could argue with the proposition that we
              should treat education from the age of 11 through to either 18 or
              21 and beyond as an integral whole. The creation of a Department
              of Education that is separate from the Department for Employment
              and Learning has probably, on balance, been a good development
              that has provided greater focus in both cases. However, it has
              brought with it greater scope for creating cross-departmental
              concerns. The Burns issues touch on such cross-departmental
              matters of importance. The Committee for Employment and Learning
              will wish to comment on the Burns Report. I cannot prejudge what
              conclusion it will come to, but our consideration is likely to
              include the following: where and how careers education can best be
              delivered; how we can widen the range of social access to further
              and higher education; how we can promote educational equality of
              opportunity as opposed to equality of outcome — Mr McCartney
              drew that distinction; and the valid principle of meritocracy.
              Finally, how can we encourage the study of subjects by 11- to
              16-year-olds or possibly through to 18 years, which will equip
              individuals for satisfying careers and will meet some of the
              likely labour skills shortages?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will now make some personal comments, while
              still focusing on the interrelationship between the Department of
              Education and the Department for Employment and Learning, because
              some real weaknesses emerge in the recommendations of the Burns
              Report. The case has not yet been adequately made to suggest that
              we should move to mixed-ability or comprehensive schools. It has
              not been made in moral or pragmatic terms with respect to
              examination results, and Mr Morrow referred to this when
              mentioning the statistics produced by Dr John Marks in his book
              about schools in England, Scotland and Wales over the last half
              century.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Burns Report, despite what it may claim, is
              inclined towards the practical introduction of comprehensive
              schooling. I favour the retention of some schools that have a
              so-called grammar school ethos, while upgrading others through
              so-called parity of esteem, especially technical and vocational
              schools. In parts of Germany, Switzerland and Austria, those
              schools have developed more strongly than they have in the United
              Kingdom. More than mere academic excellence is required.
              Excellence is best promoted by having a variety of specialist
              schools rather than — dare I say it? — bog-standard
              comprehensives. Practices in city technology colleges in England
              and in the magnet schools in the larger American cities should be
              examined.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The concept of collegiates is problematic,
              because that would add another layer of bureaucracy to an
              overcrowded field of administrative bodies. It is not envisaged
              that further education colleges would be full members of the
              collegiates, but they would have to interrelate. That would be
              confusing. The Burns Report recommends that collegiates should
              promote the crucial links between education and business, and that
              they should take the lead on careers education. That could turn
              into a turf war over the role of further education colleges. There
              are still serious funding inequities between further education
              colleges and sixth-form colleges.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Education and his Colleague at
              the Department for Employment and Learning have much to discuss. I
              support the motion.</p>

              the Burns Report — for example, the introduction of pupil
              profiles and the promotion of greater co-operation between schools

              vocational schools; comprehensive schools for 11- to 18-year-olds;
              and common lower secondary schools followed by a differentiation
              at upper level in secondary schools. The Burns team analysed those
              options and was unhappy with all of them. Regardless of our views
              about the Burns Report, at least it contained a definite proposal
              that could be discussed. I hope that that proposal, and the
              options in the Gallagher and Smith Report, will help to inform
              responses to the Department of Education.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paragraph 6.3 of the Burns Report, which deals
              with modern research on intelligence, is important. It states that
              the idea of intelligence being measured narrowly is no longer
              valid; that cannot be denied. Intelligence is seen as having many
              facets, and multifaceted intelligence is referred to. In the past,
              transfer tests assessed intelligence in a narrow and academic way,
              which limited our view of children and their abilities and
              aptitudes. If we introduced pupil profiles, the measurement of
              multifaceted intelligence would pose a major challenge, and
              unfortunately the Burns Report does not go into detail on that.
              However, before it is introduced we need to know more about the
              demands that will be placed on children and teachers by the
              additional assessment of all facets of education.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The element relating to structures and the
              collegiate system is probably the most controversial part of the
              report. In its response, the SDLP suggested greater co-operation
              between schools, so we welcome some of the aspects that are
              highlighted under the collegiate system. We want to see all
              post-primary schools working together on the basis of co-operation
              rather than competition. We are told that the proposals in the
              Burns Report do not threaten any of the existing schools, yet, as
              we know, many schools are not reassured and do not accept this.
              Currently, responsibility for managing schools rests with local
              management boards and the governors appointed to them. They have
              control over the values and the ethos of the schools, and many
              give their time and expertise to provide good education for the
              children in their areas. Under the Burns Report, they see their
              roles being downgraded in favour of the collegiate support system
              and the collegiate liaison councils. Although I support
              partnerships, I do not support any that undermine the roles or
              existing rights of school management boards.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, we should bear in mind that in
              the past all good initiatives in education — and there have been
              few over the years — have come from the teachers. Imposition has
              almost invariably resulted in failure, and the experience of our
              educators testifies to that.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion is not set in stone. We will be able
              to challenge the existing transfer system, which most of us accept
              is a legal form of discrimination that brands 60% of our children
              as failures every year; a system that reinforces educational and
              social apartheid; and one that was founded on the elitist notion
              that only a minority of children are academically gifted and that
              a child’s ability is fixed at the age of 10, or perhaps at the
              age of four, as Billy Hutchinson and Monica McWilliams said. The
              current system is a more accurate gauge of poverty and wealth than
              many of the statistics presented to us. Billy Hutchinson is right
              in saying that the worst results in the 11-plus exams each year
              are from the poorest areas of Belfast — the Shankill Road and
              the Falls Road. This system is emotionally, socially and
              culturally damaging, and it must go.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate the Minister for his commitment
              to the future education of all children and for providing us with
              the opportunity to end this divisive system, once and for all. We
              pay dearly for it. Research shows that educational
              underachievement is linked to poverty, unemployment, ill health
              and other social disasters. Our two-tier education system tells a
              long tale of underachievement, and an excessive number of people
              leave school with few or no qualifications. The system keeps a
              section of people in poverty and preserves a cycle of
              disadvantage, and we pay dearly for it. The exact cost has not
              been calculated, and it is time that it was.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the Twenty-six Counties, the economic
              consequences for early school leavers are manifest at individual
              and social levels. There is an increased likelihood of long-term
              unemployment, low-skilled and poorly paid employment, and social
              and economic marginalisation. In Canada, additional expenditure on
              remedial programmes to help cope with social problems affecting
              the aboriginal people is costing the Government £1·7 billion.
              Are we aware of what we spend on remedial programmes? Equivalent
              research has not yet been carried out here.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we continue to condone a two-tier education
              system that labels children at ten and a half and divides them
              from each another on mainly socio-economic grounds, some young
              people will destroy themselves and their environment, such will be
              their disaffection and hopelessness.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many myths have been propagated about how the
              grammar school system is superior to comprehensive education, and
              some Members have suggested that today. The first myth is that the
              comprehensive system has failed in England. There are 3,569
              secondary schools in England, of which 166 are grammar schools.
              Eighty-seven per cent of secondary pupils in state schools in
              England are in comprehensive schools. There are no grammar schools
              in Scotland and Wales. In 1965, when 8% of secondary pupils were
              in comprehensive schools, 17% acquired five passes at GCSE level.
              By 1998, when 86·7% were in comprehensive schools, 88% got five
              passes at GCSE level. Many young people attending comprehensive
              schools stay on and go to university.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second myth is that Burns will be
              implemented without proper consultation, and that these beacons of
              excellence, the grammar schools, may be closed. The Burns Report
              is not about closing schools; it is about creating excellent
              schools in every neighbourhood for all children. All schools now
              have a common curriculum and pupil-led funding, and that will not
              change if grammar schools admit local children rather than
              selecting. Many secondary schools are beacons of excellence —
              there can be excellence without selection.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another myth is that there should be a mix of
              grammar schools and other schools because we need choice and
              diversity. Supporters of selection must justify the need to put
              children through the hurdle of selection when there is no evidence
              that selection provides the best educational opportunities for all
              children.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gibson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much of what needs to be said about the Burns
              Report has already been covered.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of the many representations that I have
              received, not one supported the Burns Report. In fact, a large
              organisation such as the Ulster Farmers’ Union felt compelled to
              respond with comments that have been echoed in the Chamber today.
              That group represents about 25,000 families. The proposals will
              disadvantage children in rural areas, and we do not want that. The
              Burns Report has no rural perspective.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The current selection procedure may be wrong,
              but selection itself is not wrong. Pupil profiles are a possible
              alternative. The admission criterion of proximity to pupils’
              homes is unacceptable. The proposal that pupils may be moved from
              different schools in a collegiate to study alternative subjects is
              theoretically possible, but that would be impractical for rural
              schools. The suggestion has been made that there may be a rise in
              the number of independent schools, but low farming incomes would
              not allow children from many farming families to attend such
              schools. The return of technical colleges should be considered.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members of the Education Committee have
              received hundreds of responses that contain similar echoes of
              concern. It has been clearly stated that the principle of
              comprehensive education is based on a theory of egalitarianism.
              Venerable theologians would have it that people are equal only in
              that they are all equally sinners. However, the ideas of Marx and
              Engels have emerged. Mr McCartney and Sammy Wilson identified the
              issue that pervades the Burns Report. The burning issue, which is
              implied but never stated, is not equality of opportunity; it is
              equality of outcomes. The Minister made that telling point in his
              press release.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All the research, especially that of Dr John
              Marks, has indicated that the Organisation for Economic
              Co-operation and Development (OECD) studies offered a comparator
              of existing tripartite and comprehensive systems. The research
              carried out by the OECD and John Marks, as well as national
              research on education, indicates that comprehensive education is a
              deterrent to the raising of school standards. Therefore, the
              report’s basic tenets are wrong. Not only is the report wrong in
              principle but it follows a political ideology that has been
              abandoned by most of Europe.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Burns Report mentioned that it had examined
              the tripartite system operating in Germany, Austria and
              Switzerland. The OECD examined that system and said that it was in
              advance of any system in the British Isles, and that its pathways
              were suitably tailored to the needs of the pupil.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was touched by Billy Hutchinson’s point
              that the report should have been child-centred. The Burns Report
              is not child-centred; it is centred on an outdated Marxist
              ideology that has long been surpassed by educational thinking. I
              most detest Burns’s resorting to jargon, which implies that he
              was scared to define his position. He never spelt out the
              philosophical alternatives that are possible in education.
              Instead, he resorted to jargon. As Archbishop Temple reminded us
              in a worthy report in the House of Lords, if a man does not define
              something, the definition remains with him.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr K Robinson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have no intention of repeating the excellent
              points made already. I want to focus on the consultation on the
              Burns Report. I have observed, with growing concern, the manner in
              which the Minister of Education has led the consultation process
              on the Burns proposals. Although everyone has a right to express
              their views on that contentious report, a Minister of Education
              should have exercised prudence when overseeing the public debate
              that the proposals were designed to provoke, as they have done
              today in a generally positive way.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In fact, the Minister has sought to adopt a
              different role. In a series of unfortunate and imprudent
              statements, he has sought to steer the process and to spin the
              outcome of that steer. Meetings have been held with carefully
              selected individuals and interest groups. On 1 March 2002, while
              speaking at the annual Irish National Teachers’ Organization
              (INTO) conference, with the subtext &quot;academic selection means
              rejection&quot;, the Minister told delegates that he had
              identified what he claimed were two myths, one of which was that
              academic selection was a ladder to success for working-class
              children.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Speaking as someone who comes from a
              working-class background — as do many others in the Chamber —
              I am glad that that ladder was there for me and others, to climb,
              and that my parents felt that it was worth sacrificing many things
              to enable me to climb it. I am grateful that it was there for my
              children to avail themselves of. I hope that my grandchildren can
              benefit from similar opportunities in the future.</p>

              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If low percentages of working-class pupils
              currently benefit from that opportunity in parts of the Province,
              could it be possible that the extra-curricular activities indulged
              in by the Minister’s Colleagues over the past 30 years played a
              significant part in driving families out of inner-city areas?
              Those were families who in a normal society would have sacrificed
              many pleasures to give their children the gift of a good education
              and who would have provided the real leadership in those
              communities, had they not felt it necessary to protect their
              children from the unfolding scenario of violence and intimidation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A girl whose family lived in a Nationalist area
              of Belfast recently told me that the only good thing that her
              father could ensure was that she got a good education that was
              commensurate with her obvious academic talents. He made
              sacrifices, and his daughter received a top-class education
              alongside the offspring of the better-heeled members of her
              community. She currently holds a senior position in her chosen
              career. I asked her whether she would deny that opportunity to
              others. &quot;No way&quot; was the answer. I recall many parents
              from my former schools who worked hard — often taking on a
              second job — to ensure that their child would have all the
              necessary extras that second-level schools require from their new
              entrants.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 23 March 2002, the Minister met the
              Progressive Unionist Party to discuss the post-primary review. The
              Minister again trotted out his usual mantras, only this time he
              added the Republican harp orchestra’s rendition of
              &quot;Protestants, Catholics and Dissenters&quot;. It is good
              myth, but it is bad educational practice. The Minister has
              introduced a sectarian edge to his tired, worn-out, oversimplified
              and outdated 1970s-style socialism, which was something that I
              noticed in yesterday’s Hansard that he attributed to another
              Member of the House. That tiresome dialectic may have struck a
              chord with his Loyalist audience, as no doubt it was designed to
              do.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister’s strategy — and he has had
              some practice at that over the years — may have equipped him in
              his &quot;divide and conquer&quot; role, but I ask him the
              inconvenient question of where the good families who lived on the
              Shankill Road and the Crumlin Road, and who provided numerous
              transfer pupils for nearby schools, did move to. Who or what
              caused those families, who were the backbone and pride of their
              communities, to leave? Was that population movement not echoed in
              west Belfast by families also seeking a better future for their
              children? Interestingly, the Minister’s press release fails to
              tell us the views of the PUP representatives. Perhaps Mr Billy
              Hutchinson was expanding on that today.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 8 April, the pace was quickening because
              presumably the Minister and his acolytes were aware of the
              mounting popular distaste for the whole business of the unfolding
              Burns saga. The education and library board chiefs were treated to
              ministerial mantras. However, in their valedictory statement, the
              chief executives, to their credit, pointed out that they were
              anxious to see coherence among all three major reviews of
              education — the review of funding, the review of the curriculum
              and the review of post-primary education.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with Mr Billy Hutchinson’s comments
              on the nought to three-years-old aspect of children’s education.
              The early years are a vital part of the process, and it is one
              that will be addressed shortly by the Committee for Education. To
              the chief executives, Burns was only one of three issues, and not
              the great cure-all —</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to begin by thanking my Colleague
              Mr Sammy Wilson for tabling today’s debate. We are dealing with
              education, which has affected every single one of us at some stage
              in our lives and will continue to do so through our children.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is an extremely emotive issue, and I am not
              surprised at the feelings that have been generated, particularly
              among concerned parents and teachers. I have been inundated with
              calls and correspondence from parents and teachers, asking that I
              use my position as an elected representative to highlight the many
              deficiencies in the report. I hope that through this debate I can
              convey these concerns. Yes, we need a vision for the future, but I
              do not think that the majority of parents or teachers would
              subscribe to the vision laid out in the Burns Report.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do agree that the current system of selection
              is far from perfect, but the solutions set out in the Burns Report
              offer a very poor alternative. In his report, Burns makes no
              attempt whatsoever to answer the key question: does comprehensive
              or selective education provide the best overall results? He has
              failed to grasp that the comprehensive system has actually reduced
              educational opportunities on the mainland whilst the system in
              Northern Ireland has moved from strength to strength.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This document does not provide the way forward.
              Schools in Northern Ireland have undoubtedly proved their worth in
              every way. The education system in Northern Ireland is recognised
              throughout the United Kingdom, and examination passes bear
              testament to this fact. Our post-primary structure has produced
              the best results in the whole of the United Kingdom. More
              importantly, not only for those children who go to grammar
              schools, but for those who attend secondary schools, there is a
              mass of statistical evidence that shows that separating children
              according to their educational ability and needs enables schools
              to stretch the more academically able and cater more effectively
              for those with different aptitudes. The superior performance of
              the selective system in Northern Ireland over the comprehensive
              system in England in terms of GCSE and A-level performance, once
              again, would bear this out.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have an education system in Northern Ireland
              that has many strengths, but I do acknowledge that certain
              weaknesses exist, and those weaknesses must be addressed if we are
              to create an education system that benefits each and every single
              child.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There have been considerable changes in the
              education system in Northern Ireland as a result of the Education
              Reform (Northern Ireland) Order 1989, particularly in relation to
              the national curriculum. The introduction of the national
              curriculum instructed all schools, whether grammar or secondary,
              to follow the same curriculum. This meant that pupils who moved
              from primary school to secondary school would be offered the same
              examinations as those pupils attending grammar schools. This
              effectively enabled secondary school pupils to follow a path to
              third-level education.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondary schools in Northern Ireland have been
              very successful at meeting the needs of a very distinct range of
              abilities. They have been able to facilitate this through applying
              the concept of streaming classes according to ability, with a
              flexible aspect in place to allow pupils to move up and down
              according to attainment. This has ensured that all pupils,
              regardless of ability, have received an education that is tailored
              to their needs.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Northern Ireland, we cannot provide a
              twenty-first- century education for all by destroying the best
              part of our system and offering a watered-down alternative. We
              need a solution that provides a different system, allowing for
              both vocational and academic schools. It could be said that our
              present system does not cater adequately for the non-academic, so
              we must therefore direct our energies to providing vocational and
              technical education for those children whose talents lie elsewhere
              than in academic study.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Burns goes on to examine the collegiate system.
              The collegiate system in fact replicates a comprehensive system,
              which, as I have already stated, has reduced educational
              opportunities on the mainland. The collegiate system is unwieldy
              and bureaucratic. The collegiate system is unworkable, as it
              groups together schools of dissimilar ethos, religious affiliation
              and academic standard. This system is also yet to be proven. Why
              introduce a system that has not yet been tested? Effectively,
              Burns is using Northern Ireland as a guinea pig, which could, in
              fact, produce disastrous results. We cannot afford to get this
              wrong, as we are dealing with the education of our children.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No two children are the same. All children are
              born with different abilities. Some are prepared to work harder to
              achieve their goals, but the goal of education is to bring out the
              best in all children and bring out the best of their abilities.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am surprised that the Minister, who professes
              a &quot;Brits out&quot; attitude in everything else that he does,
              when it comes to education he wants to ape the failed English
              system and introduce comprehensive education to Northern Ireland
              through the back door. The comprehensive system in England has
              failed. At the age of 14, pupils in Northern Ireland’s selective
              system are 18 months ahead of pupils in England in English and
              mathematics, and they achieve GCSE results that are 10% better
              than those of pupils in England. That shows that the selective
              system is better for all pupils, for those at widely underrated
              secondary schools as well as for those at grammar schools. Before
              comprehensive education, A-level results in Northern Ireland were
              lower than those in England, yet shortly after the introduction of
              comprehensive education, Northern Ireland’s A-level passes
              exceeded those of England and have continued to do so ever since.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The changeover to comprehensive schools has led
              to the following shortfalls in England: each year, approximately
              60,000 16-year-olds, who would otherwise do well, fail to achieve
              five or more GCSEs. Approximately 80,000 18-year-olds, who would
              otherwise do well, fail to achieve two or more A levels. The
              increased access to universities for working-class students up
              until 1960, primarily due to grammar schools, has gone into
              reverse with the spread of comprehensive education. Some 31% of
              working-class pupils go to university in Northern Ireland,
              compared with 23% in Scotland, England and Wales. The selective
              system appears to enable pupils from the lower social classes in
              Northern Ireland to achieve better GCSE and A-level results and to
              obtain more university places than those in the rest of the United
              Kingdom. Taken together and compared with comprehensive schools,
              selective schools perform 37% better in maths, 27% better in
              English language, 28% better in science subjects, 32% better in
              geography and 70% better in French. Taking an average of all the
              main subjects, the advantage is approximately 35% in favour of
              selective schools.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Teachers and parents ask why there was not one
              practising school principal on the review body who had hands-on
              expertise in the daily running of schools. Why does Burns not
              report that 85% of respondents want grammar schools to remain
              while wishing to see an end to the 11-plus tests? Why impose a
              completely untried system unheard of anywhere in the civilised
              world? Should our children be punished in such a way? Why should
              our children be thus disadvantaged? How collegiates will work is
              unclear; history shows that children perform best alongside
              children of similar aptitude.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why is pastoral care omitted from the report?
              It is a recognised fact that the percentage of Northern Ireland
              boys and girls achieving fewer than five GCSEs has dropped in the
              past five years to 3%. That performance is significantly better
              than in other areas with similar socio-economic conditions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Billy Hutchinson’s views reflect those of
              some in the Unionist community. No one makes points to reflect the
              views of a significant number in the Nationalist community who
              want to retain grammar schools and a selective system. Shame on
              the Nationalist representatives in the Chamber that they do not
              represent the views of their people, many of whom have had to come
              to us to have their views expressed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I regret that this is turning into a Unionist
              versus Nationalist debate, because the matter transcends
              constitutional politics, Unionism and Nationalism. The debate is
              universal, and it is a shame that Nationalists have not
              represented the views of the many who send their children to
              grammar schools and who wish to retain the grammar school system.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I went to a grammar school, but we chose a
              secondary school for our first child in spite of his having
              achieved a grade that would have secured him a place in a grammar
              school. We sent him to a school that would best suit his needs. We
              must look sensibly at the selective system and allow children to
              be assessed by their academic ability and not by postcode.</p>

              scene for the debate and summed up the feelings of many in the
              Province, certainly of those in the community that I represent.
              The Minister of Education is making a huge error of judgement. He
              is advocating a comprehensive system of education, similar to the
              one across the water. That system has failed miserably and has
              resulted in lower educational standards.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.45 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have a system in Northern Ireland that has
              produced the best results in the whole of the United Kingdom for
              pupils in secondary and grammar schools. My Colleague Edwin Poots
              graphically outlined the successes of each education sector and
              how Northern Ireland seems to be streets ahead of the rest of the
              United Kingdom. It is a fact that 56% of pupils in Northern
              Ireland are achieving five or more GCSEs. On the UK mainland, the
              average is just 48%. At the other end of the spectrum, the
              Northern Ireland figure for those leaving school with no
              qualifications is much lower than the UK average. It is 3·5% in
              Northern Ireland and 6% on the UK mainland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even though the figures prove that our
              education system is well and working, it is the Minister’s
              opinion that a working system needs changing without investigating
              the alternatives. The Minister is out of touch with the people of
              the Province and out of touch with what they wish to have. I am a
              parent. I have three boys who have gone through, or are in the
              process of going through, the education system. The system has
              worked well for them, and it has worked well for most people in
              the Chamber today. Those who claim that the post-primary education
              system is failing are talking nonsense. Some 35% of children go to
              grammar schools, and a further 35% of pupils from a working-class
              background in Northern Ireland — the background that I come from
              — go on to university. That compares favourably with the
              situation in England and the rest of the UK.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept that some changes are needed in order
              to modernise the system and to bring it into line with other
              excelling countries in Europe. Transfer should be deferred until
              the age of 12. We could perhaps have a transfer test carried out
              by way of continual assessment, instead of two examinations, the
              results of which depend on the mood or condition of the child on a
              given day.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Post-primary schools are redefining themselves
              all the time, and they should be encouraged to do so. They should
              offer academic, vocational and technical courses. In that way, we
              can reduce the number of children who are leaving school with no
              qualifications. Such courses would also reduce the number of
              truants — those pupils who stay away from school because they
              cannot handle the academia, but who are suited to hands-on student
              work. Students should be able to transfer between schools. We
              often find that grammar school children drop out at the age of 16.
              They have passed the 11-plus but have, for one reason or another,
              not got to grips with what grammar schools have on offer. Many
              schools in rural areas — and Craigavon is an example of this —
              have a school that provides all-through education for children.
              That provides stability, and many friendships are maintained
              throughout school life because the cut-off at age 11 does not take
              place. The system works well for students, teachers and parents.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some bureaucrat who has not investigated the
              full implications of changing the system should not be able to
              interfere with it. The aim should be to protect the best and
              improve the rest. We should not let the Minister destroy the whole
              lot simply because it is a British system. He is opposed to
              anything that has even a hint of Britishness about it. His views
              have more to do with politics than educational standards.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister is at odds with the Committee for
              Education, the schools and the greater number of pupils, teachers
              and parents, and he should consider the motion proposed today and
              the comments that Members have made. The Minister’s opinion is
              at odds with the views of the people.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Education (Mr M McGuinness):</b>
              Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the
              opportunity afforded by Sammy Wilson’s motion to discuss the
              review of post-primary education. I agree with Peter Weir that it
              is currently the most important issue facing the education sector.
              Many contributions have been made today. Many have been
              thoughtful, although some were not so thoughtful. Overall, it has
              been a good debate, and I have no doubt that there are people on
              all sides of the argument who hold sincere views. However, the
              object of the exercise is to build consensus and ensure that the
              House and all political representatives recognise the challenge
              before us. We politicians have a huge responsibility to put in
              place the best possible education system for all our children.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have been given a real opportunity to put in
              place post-primary arrangements that will meet our needs in the
              twenty-first century and that will equip our young people and
              future generations with the knowledge and skills that they need in
              a rapidly changing and increasingly global world. As we engage in
              the debate, we are all obliged to ensure that we are properly
              informed and that our arguments are based on facts and data rather
              than on myths.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yesterday in the House I referred to the three
              great myths about our education system, and we have heard more of
              that today. The first myth is that we have a world-class education
              system that is the best in these islands. Mary Nelis spoke
              eloquently on that myth. I am the first to acknowledge that we
              have a high proportion of pupils who achieve good examination
              results, yet comparisons show that as many pupils in Scotland
              achieve five high-grade GCSEs in its comprehensive system.
              Scotland also has markedly more people entering higher education.
              More people here than in England achieve five high-grade GCSEs,
              but even England, which is often caricatured as having a failed
              comprehensive system, has fewer pupils who do not achieve five
              GCSE passes. We still have the highest proportion of children in
              these islands with low qualifications, and that is the long tail
              of low achievement that has been highlighted by research.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paddy Roche referred to international
              comparisons, as did Robert McCartney, Peter Weir and Edwin Poots.
              I remind Members that recent international research into standards
              found that, among 15-year-olds, our pupils performed on a par with
              pupils in England and Scotland, but did substantially less well
              than the top performers. Where were the top performers? They were
              in Finland, South Korea, New Zealand and Canada, all of which have
              non-selective systems. When people talk about comparisons, they
              must take a broader view and consider that there is a bigger world
              outside England, Scotland and Wales, and, indeed, here. We must
              recognise that other systems in the world are doing well, and we
              have a responsibility to look at that and learn lessons.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">More critically, the variation in our best and
              worst scores was among the widest in the participating countries,
              which highlights the recurrent theme of an education system with
              high achievement and substantial low achievement — a system that
              performs well for some but poorly for the rest. The 1996
              International Adult Literacy Survey found that almost one quarter
              of our adult workforce has the lowest level of literacy. That
              legacy has been left to us by our so-called world-class education
              system, and the sooner we wake up to that, the better.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second myth is that academic selection
              provides a ladder to success for working-class and disadvantaged
              children. Peter Weir, Bob McCartney and Ken Robinson dealt with
              that. Bob McCartney was particularly disappointing when he
              repeated that point in what I thought was an intellectually barren
              and narrow-minded contribution. We must look at the facts. Under
              our current system of academic selection, children from low-income
              families make up only 8% of pupils in grammar schools, and that
              proportion has fallen in the past four years. Far from being a
              ladder for working-class children, academic selection is an
              increasingly slippery pole.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Consider the transfer test results: the least
              disadvantaged pupils who sit the 11-plus are almost three times as
              likely to achieve a grade A as the most disadvantaged pupils. That
              hardly supports the case for academic selection as an escape route
              from poverty.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Which group in our society achieves the worst
              results in academic selection? The answer, which may be
              unpalatable, is the most disadvantaged sections of the Protestant
              community. The poorest 11-plus results are achieved in controlled
              schools with high levels of free school meals that serve
              working-class Protestant areas. David Ervine and Billy Hutchinson
              of the Progressive Unionist Party told me that, in many
              working-class Protestant areas, a grammar school place is beyond
              the reach of almost all pupils. In the Shankill, less than 2% of
              pupils gain a grammar school place. If that is not a damming
              indictment, I do not know what is.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proportion of pupils from the most
              disadvantaged controlled primary schools in other areas of Belfast
              who obtain a grammar school place is also appallingly low — 4%
              in west Belfast, 5% in east Belfast, 8% in north Belfast and 15%
              in south Belfast. Those figures demolish the myth that academic
              selection provides a ladder to success for disadvantaged children,
              especially in Protestant communities.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members raised an important and perplexing
              matter, which I responded to during Question Time yesterday, that
              has not yet been satisfactorily answered. In the light of those
              disturbing figures, why do the main Unionist parties support the
              continuation of an academically selective system that impacts most
              negatively on disadvantaged Protestant communities?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is an issue for those parties to consider,
              but I shall make my position, as Minister of Education, clear.
              Some Members may dispute it, but it is sincerely held. I want
              fairness and better educational opportunities for all children,
              whether they live on the Falls Road or the Shankill Road, in the
              Bogside or the Waterside, in Crossmaglen or Portadown, regardless
              of their colour or creed, whether they are well off or
              disadvantaged, and whatever their abilities. Every child must be
              given the opportunity to succeed. I shall work to ensure that the
              new arrangements deliver that opportunity.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Someone said recently that the idea that every
              child can succeed is a myth. I totally disagree with that. As
              educationalists, we have a responsibility to create an education
              system in which every child can succeed and fulfil his or her full
              potential. During the debate, Mr Shannon said that we should keep
              the best and improve the rest. I want the best for everyone,
              regardless of where they live or who they are.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third myth is that, in order to go to
              university and get a good job, a grammar school education is
              necessary. Traditionally, grammar schools have been the main
              providers of university entrants. However, the world moves on.
              Currently, 35% of pupils obtain places in grammar schools, yet the
              participation rate in higher education is much greater at 44%, and
              is projected to increase. A place in higher education is not
              dependent on a grammar school education now and will be even less
              so in the future.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Prof Gerry McKenna, vice-chancellor of the
              University of Ulster, told me that only approximately 50% of its
              students have traditional A levels, with the rest coming from a
              variety of routes. Significantly, the university found no
              difference in academic outcome, irrespective of the route that
              students had taken. Prof George Bain, vice-chancellor of Queen’s
              University, informed me that many of its students, including some
              of the best, did not follow the traditional A-level route.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The facts do not support the three great myths,
              which are that we have a world-class education system, academic
              selection is a ladder to success for working-class children, and
              grammar schools are an essential route to entry to higher
              education and university.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Local research has strongly confirmed the clear
              and pressing need for change. Prof Gallagher and Prof Smith found
              that the current arrangements distort the primary curriculum and
              create a sense of failure in two thirds of our children. I heard
              about that sense of failure this morning when I met with
              representatives of the Northern Ireland Council for Voluntary
              Action (NICVA) in Belfast.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have schools that do not achieve good
              results. In addition, disadvantaged children come from low-income
              families and cause unnecessary pressure and anxiety. Our
              discussions this morning focused on those issues. When the people
              around the table spoke of their experiences with colleagues in
              colleges in this city, a great deal of pain and hurt was revealed.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Prof John Gardner’s research highlighted the
              technical inadequacy of the 11-plus. Save the Children used
              children’s own words to make the most powerful case for change.
              I have been criticised by some people for quoting them, but we
              must listen to what children tell us. I make no apology for
              repeating their views. Commenting on the test, one child said:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;I felt so nervous on the morning of the
              11-plus I was nearly sick. I barely got to sleep the night before
              and when I did I woke up at 3.00 am to find myself sleepwalking. I
              never sleepwalk and to make matters worse I was changing into my
              uniform. I didn’t want to eat my breakfast in case I threw up
              but Mum made me eat some.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another child gave her view on the test, and
              she said, most tellingly:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;If you’re smart you go to a grammar
              school but if you’re stupid you go to a secondary school and
              that’s where I’m going, to a secondary school because … I’m
              stupid.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The complete absurdity of the 11-plus was
              succinctly expressed by another child when she said:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;People judge you by 2 hours in your
              life.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask Members how they would feel if their
              children said that to them. I cannot and will not accept
              educational arrangements that make children sick with nerves, make
              them feel stupid and that judge them on two hours of their lives.
              There must be change, and I am pleased that the Committee for
              Education agrees. In its report, the Committee concluded that
              change is both necessary and appropriate. I have been encouraged
              greatly by the almost unanimous agreement that change is needed
              and by the shift in the debate from the question of whether change
              is necessary to what kind of change is needed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Billy Hutchinson hit the nail on the head —
              his contribution was thoughtful and knowledgeable, and his remarks
              about social justice were well made. He also addressed the issue
              of early intervention, which is important. I agree that there is a
              need for early intervention and support, and the Department of
              Education has already undertaken some initiatives: the pre-school
              education system has been greatly expanded; the Making a Good
              Start initiative was established; classroom assistants have been
              employed for primary 1 classes, and that provision has been
              extended to primary 2 classes in the most deprived schools. The
              local management of schools (LMS) common funding formula will skew
              more of the available funding towards the primary sector, and the
              review of the curriculum that is under way will examine what
              children learn and when they learn it. All those matters are
              important.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Burns proposals that were published for
              consultation in October 2001 set out one possible model for
              change, and I must address several misconceptions about the
              consultation process. First, it is important to stress that no
              decisions have been taken about the proposals. Some people think
              that this is a done deal; nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, the choice is not between the Burns
              proposals, in their entirety, and nothing. The Burns Report offers
              one way forward, but it may not be the only way. Therefore, I have
              invited comments on the Burns Report and asked for suggestions for
              modifications to the report, or alternative approaches.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, there is a view that there is no point
              in responding to the consultation because no one is interested in
              what people have to say and that Ministers will simply make
              decisions anyway. That may have been how things were done in the
              past, but we now have a local Administration and Ministers who are
              accountable to the electorate. Everyone’s views count.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The publication of the Burns Report has
              generated a huge and ongoing public debate, and it is useful to
              take stock of how the debate is developing. Despite the impression
              that is often given through the media, significant areas of
              consensus are emerging on the guiding principles that underpin the
              Burns proposals, particularly the view that each child should be
              valued equally, the abolition of the transfer test, the value of
              the pupil profile and the value of collaboration and co-operation
              between schools.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are also areas of contention, and, in
              seeking to advance the debate, I have stressed the need to focus
              on academic selection. This is central to the shape of any new
              arrangements, and Oliver Gibson referred to this crucial issue.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a view that the 11-plus can simply be
              abolished — clearly this cannot happen unless another process of
              academic selection is put in its place or academic selection is
              abolished. The review body made clear its view that simply to
              replace the test with another form of academic selection would
              perpetuate many of the weaknesses of the present arrangements. The
              11-plus and academic selection are inextricably linked. The sole
              reason for the 11-plus is to provide a means of academic selection
              for grammar schools. The issue is not about the test but about
              academic selection, and we must be clear on this. Academic
              selection for some means academic rejection for most of our
              children. We must all look beyond the symptom — dissatisfaction
              with the 11-plus — to the cause, which is academic selection and
              rejection. That is what the debate must be about. I welcome the
              growing concentration on this key issue in public discussions, and
              I am holding meetings with interested parties to discuss the
              issues raised by the post-primary review.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Esmond Birnie referred to the need for a
              cross-departmental approach, and I welcome the interest of the
              Committee for Employment and Learning. I have already met
              representatives of higher and further education, the chief
              executives of all five boards, the main teachers’ unions, the
              CCMS, the Progressive Unionist Party, and the Belfast
              partnerships. Some consistent views have been expressed, including
              a general recognition that there are serious problems with our
              education system and a widespread acceptance of the adverse
              effects of academic selection, which is considered to be socially
              divisive. CCMS, the five main teachers’ unions, the
              vice-chancellors, further education principals, the Belfast
              partnerships and the Progressive Unionist Party all agreed that
              academic selection should end, and the boards want a system that
              puts children at the heart of the process. The same strong message
              was given to the Education Committee and is set out in its report.
              It states:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;A clear majority of those submitting
              evidence to the review stated that formal selection as currently
              organised in Northern Ireland should be abolished.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have planned further meetings with principals
              of primary schools, Catholic and controlled grammar schools, NICIE
              (Northern Ireland Council for Integrated Education), NICVA
              (Northern Ireland Council for Voluntary Action), the Transferor
              Representatives’ Council and my Colleague at the Department for
              Employment and Learning. I have also written to the other
              political parties inviting them to discuss the review, and I hope
              that they will all accept this invitation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A meeting has also been arranged with the
              Governing Bodies Association (GBA), and I look forward to hearing
              its perspective. I have welcomed its statements supporting the
              need for change. The GBA has concerns about the Burns proposals
              but has given a commitment to identify an acceptable method of
              happily matching pupils to schools. This is a positive and
              responsible approach, but time is moving on, and no proposals have
              yet been produced. If the GBA has developed acceptable proposals,
              I urge it to make them available for public scrutiny and
              consideration as soon as possible, certainly before the end of the
              consultation period.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The recent statement by the Northern bishops
              was a crucial contribution to the debate. They are the trustees of
              the majority of Catholic-managed grammar and secondary schools,
              which represent almost half our post-primary schools. They have
              given a clear message to the whole of the Catholic-managed school
              sector that academic selection by testing at age 11 or later is
              not acceptable. The bishops stated that pupils and parents, guided
              by teachers and career guidance counsellors using continuous
              assessment, should make decisions about educational pathways on
              the basis of election and choice. The bishops’ statement has
              moved the debate on significantly in the Catholic school sector,
              which can now focus on how best to develop arrangements that meet
              the bishops’ aim of providing an education system that fosters
              justice, social cohesion and reconciliation and maintains and
              enhances quality but does not promote elitism. I encourage others
              to consider the key issue of academic selection as the first
              crucial step in progressing their response to the review.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Department’s consultation on the
              post-primary review is the largest ever undertaken on an
              educational issue. We have issued a consultation pack, including a
              video to all schools, further education colleges, training
              organisations, community organisations and public libraries in
              order to encourage and stimulate discussion of the issues. These
              bodies will also receive a detailed response booklet at the end of
              April. The views of the public are important, and we will be
              gathering those through a household response form that will be
              issued to every household in late May. The massive scale of this
              consultation reflects the importance of the issue. I want as many
              people as possible to take part in the debate and to submit their
              comments to my Department.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to deal with as many of the issues
              raised as time will allow. Sammy Wilson raised the issue of the
              meeting with the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools. It was
              alleged that I stated that academic selection must go. It was the
              CCMS that stated after the meeting that academic selection must
              go, not me. Mr Wilson’s other more political comments clearly
              show that, after all this time, he is still in absolute denial
              about the Good Friday Agreement. His hope that after next year’s
              Assembly elections the DUP, as the largest party, would prevent
              Sinn Féin being involved in Government shows that the DUP is not
              only running away from the Good Friday Agreement, but it is
              running away from the issue of post-primary education. The issue
              will not go away and will have to be faced up to.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sammy Wilson also raised the issue of academic
              selection and the transfer tests. It was suggested that I had
              called for an end to selection, whereas Burns referred to the
              abolition of academic selection. I have said throughout this
              consultation that academic selection is the key issue that must be
              addressed. Transfer tests and academic selection are inextricably
              linked. There cannot be a selective system without a means of
              selection. The transfer test cannot be abolished unless some other
              process is put in its place.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sammy Wilson also raised the issue of the
              household response form and its neutrality. The response form
              provides everyone with the opportunity to contribute to the
              debate; therefore, it is important that its content be politically
              neutral. The response form will include a summary of the main
              proposals made by Burns and will ask several questions on the key
              issues. It is important that we consider educational issues and
              raise the debate above any party political perspective. I provided
              the Committee for Education, of which Sammy Wilson is the Deputy
              Chairperson, with a copy of both the household response form and
              the detailed response booklet before they were finalised so that
              members could make suggestions about how they could be improved,
              and to clarify the issues and help to facilitate responses.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sammy Wilson, Danny Kennedy, Patricia Lewsley
              and Peter Weir discussed admissions. It is difficult for children
              from disadvantaged areas to access grammar schools. I am aware of
              the allegations expressed by some that the admissions criteria
              proposed by Burns would lead to selection by postcode. Others say
              that our existing education system is socially selective and that
              it disadvantages the working class. It is also claimed that a
              comprehensive system based on neighbourhood schools would lead to
              social selection and would be accompanied by the introduction of
              private schools. These are difficult issues, but I do not rule out
              the possibility of devising alternative arrangements for making
              decisions on school admissions to avoid some of these problems.
              There are examples in other countries that we could consider.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have noted the concerns expressed
              specifically about the admissions criteria, including the use of
              proximity as a final criterion. Let me make it clear: I have
              invited alternatives to the Burns proposals. It is open to
              everyone to suggest alternative or additional criteria.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.15 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Peter Weir and Sammy Wilson raised the issue of
              pupil profiling. The establishment of pupil profiles is one of the
              key recommendations in the report. The intention is to provide a
              better basis on which parents and pupils can make decisions on
              their post-primary school. I welcome comments on that as part of
              the response to the full report. Concerns have been expressed that
              it would increase the administrative burden on teachers and
              schools. I am conscious of the bureaucratic burden on teachers,
              and I will continue to work to reduce that in any new arrangements
              that are implemented.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Using the pupil profile for admission purposes
              would not be another form of academic selection. The full range of
              information contained in a profile would have to be reduced to a
              single letter or grade. That would be difficult to do and would
              run counter to the whole purpose of a holistic pupil profile. The
              use of the pupil profile in that way would not overcome the
              weakness that two thirds of the pupils are regarded as failures at
              the age of 11, and they suffer a huge and enduring blow to their
              self-esteem.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, using the pupil profile would put
              more pressure on teachers and parents, and it is unlikely to have
              the broad support of the teaching profession. It has been
              suggested that the pupil profile could be used for selection
              purposes. Teachers’ unions are adamantly opposed to the use of
              the pupil profile for any form of selection.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Danny Kennedy and Ken Robinson said that the
              consultation was biased, and that the Department was not
              conducting a fair and open consultation. I am satisfied that the
              consultation has been handled properly, and I refute any claims
              that it has been biased. My role in the consultation is to
              facilitate and encourage debate on the key issues by everyone who
              has an interest or an opinion. It is important that all sides of
              the arguments be voiced so that there is an open and balanced
              debate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recent press statements that I issued reflect
              the views that were expressed to me. I am holding a series of
              meetings with key interests to listen to their views and to help
              to stimulate informed debate on the issues. The video and support
              materials, the household response forms and the detailed response
              booklets are politically neutral and were made available to the
              Education Committee for comment. Several helpful comments and
              suggestions were incorporated into the materials. I intend to
              publish a summary of the responses. It will take time to analyse
              those responses, but I expect to be able to publish a summary by
              the end of September 2002.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to place on record my appreciation of
              the valuable contribution made by the Education Committee, and the
              fact that it was able to respond to tight deadlines dictated by
              the timescale for the consultation. That illustrates my good
              working relationship with the Committee, and I look forward to
              that continuing as the review progresses.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paddy Roche raised the issue of grammar
              schools. Our grammar schools provide high standards of attainment
              for one third of our pupils. However, we need to think about the
              impact of our academically selective arrangements on the large
              majority of children who do not get to a grammar school. There is
              evidence from Scotland, and from the recent Programme for
              International Student Assessment (PISA) study of the Organisation
              for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, to
              suggest that other systems can achieve comparable, or even better,
              results.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a significant variation in the
              performance of our grammar schools. The percentage of pupils
              achieving three or more A levels can range from 30% in the
              lowest-achieving schools to 68% in the highest-achieving schools.
              The percentage of pupils achieving seven or more GCSEs at grades A
              to C can range from 75% in the lowest-achieving schools to 98% in
              the highest-achieving schools.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the voluntary grammar schools will
              support and participate in whatever new post-primary arrangements
              are put in place. Any school that is thinking about becoming
              independent will have to consider the financial implications.

              grants paid to the schools by my Department. Teachers in
              independent schools would be removed from the current pay and
              pension arrangements. Fees would be determined by each school and
              would vary from school to school. The annual fees in independent
              schools in England range from £6,000 to £10,000.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a pressing demand for change, and it
              is incumbent on us to focus on the needs of children rather than
              on party politics or the interests of particular institutions. The
              challenge for us all is to recognise that change is necessary, and
              that we must build the maximum possible consensus on new
              arrangements.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr S Wilson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In his final remarks, the Minister has shown
              the House how sincere he is when he talks about consensus on the
              subject. It is clear that those who do not go down the route that
              Martin McGuinness wants will have the financial and the
              administrative Armalite held to their heads as they are pushed
              into acceding to the Minister’s wishes. I am glad to see that
              the gloves are coming off in this fight. I hope that the Minister’s
              last remarks will be a wake-up call to all those who have sat back
              complacently, believing that the decent thing will be done,
              because this Minister does not intend to do the decent thing by
              education. As other people have said, he intends to ram through
              his 1960s socialist dogma regardless of whether there is consensus
              or not.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This has been an interesting debate. We have
              had a range of views. Patricia Lewsley stuck her head in the sand
              and ignored the views of the many middle-class Nationalists who
              are flocking to grammar schools. However, Patricia Lewsley’s
              answer is to have all-ability comprehensive schools with
              all-ability classes and no streaming. That really is going back to
              the failed policies of the 1960s. I very much doubt that too many
              SDLP voters will be sympathetic to that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As usual, Eileen Bell sat firmly on the fence.
              She wants to keep the best aspects of the grammar schools but do
              away with selection. I do not know how that can be done. Perhaps
              she will explain it to us some other time. Mary Nelis was also
              stuck in the 1960s. The only thing missing from Mary Nelis’s
              speech about elitism and class discrimination was a rendition of
              ‘The Red Flag’ at the end.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister displayed his usual stuck-needle
              approach. I have heard and read his speech before. It went to the
              INTO conference and to the CCMS, and now we have had it in the
              Assembly. At least he could have done the decent thing and dreamt
              up a new speech for today. He started off by saying that the
              debate had to be based on properly informed opinions and on data.
              He may even have used the phrase &quot;robust data&quot;. What did
              we get? We got three stories about wee girls waking up in the
              middle of the night and sleepwalking. Is that robust data? [<i>Interruption</i>].</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is what the Minister is using: emotional
              blackmail or emotional claptrap. Either the argument is based on
              data and facts, or it is based on the kind of nonsense that we got
              from the Minister today. That is not the way to proceed. When it
              comes to data, I would have thought that he would have learned the
              lesson from his long years of interrogation by the police, the
              Army and others — get your story straight before you open your
              mouth or else keep it shut.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister tells us that 8% of working-class
              youngsters get to a grammar school. Gerry McHugh tells us that 15%
              of those who go to grammar schools are on free school meals. Which
              is it? Is it 8% or 15%? Perhaps it is something different.
              However, we are told that our arguments must be based on data —
              myth number two or three, or whatever it was.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister tells us in England fewer pupils
              leave school with fewer than five GCSEs. That is not what he told
              Peter Weir on 21 March. My understanding is that 11% is greater
              than 8%, but perhaps I am wrong. That is what the Minister said in
              a written answer to Peter Weir. If he is going to base these
              claims on data, he should get the data and the story right.
              However, the evidence and the arguments do not matter; the
              Minister is determined to go down a certain route.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He mentioned that you cannot have a selective
              system without some form of selection — that is right. The end
              of academic selection will not mean that there will be a
              non-selective system. Mr Burns made that clear when he stated in
              his report that there would still be oversubscribed schools. Will
              the Minister tell us how people will be selected, if he is not
              going to select on the basis of what is best for them
              academically? Let us make it clear that selection does not involve
              academic rejection; it is a selection for the best route. You are
              not rejecting people; you are saying that one route is best for
              some people and that another is best for others. The use of
              emotional language is the final appeal of someone whose arguments
              are bankrupt. If you are not going to select people on the basis
              of their academic ability and what is best for them educationally,
              what are you left with? You are left with only two other kinds of
              selection — economic selection or social selection. Socially
              deprived people would come out far worse on those counts than they
              do on the basis of academic selection.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have the evidence in England of the Prime
              Minister’s escaping the bog-standard system of education that
              people want to introduce into Northern Ireland by paying for his
              youngsters to go to school. Half of his Cabinet have turned their
              backs on their socialist principles — or perhaps they do not
              have any socialist principles. In any case, they have turned their
              backs on their rhetoric, and they pay to send their youngsters to
              school. That is the alternative to academic selection. Trade
              unions are opposed to pupil profiles being used for any form of
              selection. Mr Burns also pointed that out:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;If assessment outcomes in primary schools
              are used by post-primary schools to select children, for enrolment
              or for the purposes of ability streaming or banding, pressure
              grows at primary school to coach for assessment tests, and
              ultimately results in distortions and inequalities in teaching and
              learning&quot;.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Schools may be prevented from seeing those
              profiles before youngsters arrive, but when they get those
              profiles, one cannot stop them from using them for streaming. They
              can do whatever they wish with them then. The things that the
              Minister told us that he would abolish will not be abolished. In
              fact, they will be stretched out over one, two or three years. I
              am not saying that; Mr Burns said it, and the Minister admitted
              it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The trade unions do not want pupil profiles to
              be used for any form of selection, but, once they are published,
              neither the trade unions nor the Minister nor anyone else can stop
              them from being used for that purpose. Let us not pretend that
              these issues are clear-cut. I want to pick up on a point that
              Billy Hutchinson made because there is an attempt to drive a wedge
              between Unionists. I represent a working-class constituency, but I
              could no longer describe myself as working class. Given their
              incomes, I do not think that any Members could describe themselves
              as such.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nevertheless, let me say this. The sacrifices
              that my parents made to send me to a grammar school, which I
              earned a place in, enabled me to climb up the ladder. I have
              taught numerous youngsters from working-class backgrounds in a
              grammar school, and they have since been able to climb up the
              ladder as a result of the system. There are many others who will
              be advantaged by the continuation of a system that caters for
              diverse needs by providing different institutions for them.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, there is a problem, and Bob McCartney
              highlighted one answer to it. It is not only a matter of the
              11-plus — it is a whole attitude in society. How do we value
              those who go a different educational route? A change in the
              11-plus, or increased spending at the lower end of education, will
              not answer that question. Many complex issues need to be
              addressed, and I hope that, in the coming months, we shall have
              the opportunity to do that. As I said earlier, I trust that the
              Minister will not run away from the House when it comes to making
              decisions; that he will listen to the Members of the House; and
              that the big stick that he wielded at the end of his speech does
              not show the way in which the debate will be conducted.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the exodus of Members does not
              reflect their interest in the subject that I am about to discuss
              and that I hope to do something about. I shall ignore those
              leaving the Chamber and get on with the business. I do not need to
              remind Members that waste management is one of the biggest
              bread-and-butter issues to face us at this time, whatever our
              party or constituency. Each of us is concerned from time to time
              with very local aspects of waste management, such as litter
              control. At times we may focus more on the domestic side of waste
              management. Some of us yearn for separate bins — blue bins,
              white bins, green bins and yellow bins — for glass and paper in
              order to separate organic and garden waste so that it can be used
              for compost, and to set aside residual general waste. However, if
              we want to make a difference, we must deal with the bigger
              picture. We need to step back and have a long-term view on the
              problem.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue is bigger than Northern Ireland; it
              is an all-Ireland and, indeed, an all-Europe issue. Approaches to
              it should be on the agenda for the relevant cross-border
              ministerial meetings and involve co-operation between Departments,
              North and South, as there are no politics in this as such. If we
              cannot find solutions by working together and by giving mutual
              support; North and South; we shall disappear under the
              ever-growing mountain of rubbish.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am intrigued by Minister Noel Dempsey’s
              efforts in the South; his recent taxation of plastic bags was
              interesting. Overnight there was a rapid reduction in the number
              of bags blowing about in hedgerows across Southern Ireland, and
              the public reacted favourably. My difficulty with our current
              efforts on waste management and recycling is that we all talk the
              talk, but we do not walk the walk. We speak the jargon, we have
              all the clichés, but we do nothing substantial, and the waste
              management strategy remains fragmented, piecemeal and effectively
              useless.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much of the responsibility for handling our
              waste rests with local district councils, and in many cases they
              dispose of waste into landfill sites. However, it is the
              Department of the Environment that sets the policy, even though
              overall responsibility does not appear to rest anywhere. There is
              a magic circle in which the buck keeps being passed. To overcome
              that and get everyone on board, we need a cohesive, dynamic
              partnership between our Government — regional government and
              local government — and the environmental interests in the
              broader community. A free-standing agency that can relate to all
              interests will best meet that objective.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a problem with our current approach.
              We do not have a lack of raw material, as there is any God’s
              amount of it. We do not have a lack of public interest — if a
              member of the public recognises someone as a public
              representative, whether at local government or Assembly level, he
              or she will get an earbashing about waste management. The
              difficulty is outlets and markets for the product — or the
              by-product — and the lack of meaningful vision to take a
              large-scale, long-term view and make a difference.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It behoves us to find ways and means to create
              opportunities and outlets to allow recycling to flourish. Why does
              the Department for Regional Development, which is involved in the
              big infrastructure contracts, not specify that recycled concrete
              from brick rubble and the like can be used as hard-core fill for
              road and other infrastructure schemes, such as car parking? I am
              not suggesting that it should be used to resurface a road,
              although 25% to 30% of the hard-core rubble that goes into much of
              those developments could be derived from recycled material.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must have commitment as an Assembly, and we
              must create that commitment and stick with it until we have solved
              the waste problem. We need to act in a meaningful, functional
              joined-up mode, and the only way to do that is to create a strong,
              powerful agency in the North to work closely with whatever
              authority exists in the South. Better than that would be an
              all-island agency like Tourism Ireland Ltd to manage this crisis
              aggressively and with authority.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have to begin to sort out the bigger
              aspects. I shall now deal with construction, demolition and
              industrial waste rather than domestic waste, which we tend to
              focus on more often.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem of domestic waste will be resolved.
              There was an interesting EU Directive recently about recycling
              electrical appliances or returning them to the manufacturers. I am
              not sure how that will work, but I shall monitor it with interest.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the next Department of Agriculture and Rural
              Development contract for a road scheme were to specify that 20% of
              the hard core is to be from recycled sources, that would make a
              vast difference. Many people in that business are struggling. They
              stockpile a certain amount of recycled material and must dump the
              rest as landfill because there is no market for it. If there were
              an outlet for the material, a conveyor-belt system would be
              created that would allow construction and demolition waste to be
              reused. If we had a market for such waste, even for industrial
              waste, much of which is metal in the form of old engines or
              machines, the problem of domestic waste could be resolved through
              pre-selection into separate bins for different destinations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of us were excited by what we saw in
              Denmark, where in the middle of Copenhagan, there is a large
              non-toxic incinerator that generated masses of electricity at a
              low cost and also supplied the neighbourhood for a mile around
              with relatively free heating and hot water. That incinerator
              fascinated me. It burned wood, clothing, paper, some plastic bags
              and even disposable nappies. Few Members will be aware that the
              biggest element of domestic waste in a home in which there are
              small children is disposable nappies. They do not make useful
              landfill.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Food and organic waste can go into compost
              heaps, and we have to create the culture for that. Many people
              will be happy to make such provision. Garden waste and hedge
              cuttings can also go into the compost heap.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The UK is the second-largest producer of
              construction and demolition waste in the EU. The EU produces 180
              million tonnes of construction waste a year. That is a massive
              amount. Reusing even a fraction of that would help. Europe-wide,
              30% of construction waste is recycled: 70% goes to landfill. Some
              40% of the waste comprises bricks, concrete, et cetera, 50% is
              stone and soil, and the remainder comprises small amounts of
              metal, asphalt and tar.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland produces 1·8 million tonnes
              of construction waste each year. Southern Ireland produces 2·7
              million tonnes. All the waste in the South goes to landfill
              initially, but they manage to recycle 40% of that. Those figures
              need to rise up to 75% or 80%. Mobile crushing machinery is now
              available that can go onto a demolition site, grind the concrete
              and dispose of the waste as fill for somewhere else. I stand to be
              corrected on this matter, but I understand that some of the
              demolition waste removed from the M3 flyover was used in the
              Odyssey project.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other demolition waste was used for some of the
              developments around the Titanic Quarter. The UK uses around 420
              million tonnes of aggregates each year. Northern Ireland uses
              about 15 million or 20 million tonnes. One million tonnes of that
              could be derived from recycled materials.</p>

              waste, but I wish to refer briefly to opportunities for recycling
              industrial waste. Iron and scrap metals, as well as other
              materials, can be recycled rather than dumped in landfill sites.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful to the Minister for attending the
              debate. It is not enough to cry about recycling and the problem of
              waste management. Markets must be created as an outlet for
              recycled products and by-products, so that recovered metals can be
              reused and gain some added value. However, that will not happen if
              there are no markets.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall summarise the main points.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members must take waste management seriously.
              It is a major industrial and domestic issue. Let us set meaningful
              targets for the reuse of so-called waste, whether it be concrete,
              wood, paper, iron or other metals. Let us consider seriously the
              possibilities of incinerating pre-selected, suitable waste and
              generating cheap electricity — God knows our electricity is
              expensive enough. It may be possible to distribute the waste heat
              from that process to heat water or to provide central heating for
              people in the neighbourhood.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must try to ensure that departmental
              contracts specify that a percentage of recycled products would be
              desirable. My understanding is that, unless the contracts specify
              such requirements at the outset, nothing will be done.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given that the Business Committee has allocated
              90 minutes for the debate and many Members wish to contribute, I
              ask Members to limit their speeches to six minutes.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for the
              Environment (Rev Dr William McCrea):</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the ideas behind the motion.
              Throughout the life of the Assembly, the Environment Committee has
              been proactive in encouraging everyone in Northern Ireland —
              industry, commerce, the public and Government — to play an
              active role in waste minimisation and recycling.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last month, the Committee hosted a reception
              for the chairperson and members of the UK Sustainable Development
              Commission, whose task it is to alert society to the challenges of
              sustainable development. Sustainable development is about
              returning to the most basic assumptions about the working of the
              economy and about learning to live within ecological and social
              limits. Innovative policy-making and departmental co-operation
              will be required to meet such challenges. The Committee for the
              Environment has taken, and will maintain, a keen interest in
              sustainable development through its encouragement of local
              councils to develop and implement effective waste management
              plans, which, when adopted finally, will underpin the Department
              of the Environment’s waste management strategy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee for the Environment welcomes
              moves by the Department to increase public awareness of waste
              minimisation and recycling through the Wake Up to Waste campaign,
              which promotes partnership with local authorities to achieve the
              key objectives and to bring about an important change in the
              public’s attitude to waste.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the determination and dedication of
              the Committee for the Environment has been a significant factor in
              progressing the Wake Up to Waste campaign. The Department launched
              its waste management strategy in March 2000, yet there was little
              or no progress on plans for waste reduction, recycling and
              education until September 2001. In July 2001, the Committee
              pressed the Department, not only on the slow progress of waste
              management plans but on the need to develop urgently a parallel
              programme of waste-recycling education for householders,
              businesses and schools. A key role in waste reduction lies with
              manufacturers, whose products and production systems must be
              modified urgently to minimise waste and maximise recycling
              opportunities.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee encouraged the Department to
              extend the Great Britain waste and resources action programme to
              Northern Ireland. The GB programme promotes sustainable waste
              management. Its role, through the Waste Management Advisory Board,
              is to remove barriers to waste minimisation, to reuse and recycle,
              and to create stable and efficient markets for recycled materials
              and products. Such activities, and good waste data studies, if
              efficiently implemented, fulfil the role of a recycling agency
              that is envisaged in the motion.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to regional waste management plans,
              which are essential to the development of Northern Ireland’s
              long-term strategy to deal with waste, the Committee was most
              concerned to learn that in the September 2001 monitoring round,
              the Department was forced to surrender £1 million of the £3·5
              million that was allocated to waste management for 2001-02.
              Indeed, until the Committee intervened, there was a real danger
              that even more of the £3·5 million would have been lost. The
              Committee was so concerned with the lack of progress that it twice
              met — in September 2001 and in January 2002 — representatives
              of the three regional waste management district council
              partnerships and officials from the Department’s Environment and
              Heritage Service to urge progress on the development of the waste
              management plans.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee also monitored progress through
              regular correspondence with the three regional partnerships and
              with the Department, especially on the Department’s scheme to
              distribute waste management funds to district councils. Members
              will, therefore, understand the Committee’s pleasure when the
              Minister announced the launch of the Wake Up to Waste campaign on
              7 February 2002. It welcomes that campaign. However, I must
              emphasise that it is simply an important starting point. Much
              remains to be done, and I assure the House that the Committee for
              the Environment will continue to monitor progress and will
              actively intervene if progress is not evident.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall leave Members with this thought: it is
              not enough for Government to educate industry and the public on
              the importance of waste minimisation and recycling. Government
              Departments and all public bodies, such as health boards and
              education boards, must lead the way by giving practical support,
              by improving their own waste management performance and by
              developing sustainable procurement policies. Imagine the effect of
              that one act on the market for recycled and recovered materials in
              Northern Ireland. I support the thought behind the motion.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Armstrong:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Waste is an enormous issue for everyone in
              Northern Ireland — a relatively small country that produces its
              fair share of industrial, commercial and domestic waste in every
              corner of the region. Failure to utilise waste successfully could
              result in the diminution of Northern Ireland as a tourist
              attraction, a place of economic opportunity and, most importantly,
              a natural and healthy place to live. Therefore, it is of great
              importance to find effective methods to recycle waste.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no point in creating mountains of
              plastic, aluminium, paper, metal or glass. We do not need any more
              mountains in Europe. We remember the great push for paper, plastic
              and glass recycling in the 1970s and the resultant bankruptcies of
              firms that were left with stockpiles of products that had no
              commercial outlets. The initial concentration on efforts to
              recycle paper and aluminium was a mistake.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The raw material of paper production, if
              properly utilised from forests where planting is in balance with
              felling, is a sustainable resource. Moreover, if correctly
              processed, paper is a biodegradable and necessary ingredient in
              making compost. Aluminium, on the other hand, is most plentiful
              and there is no excuse for wasting it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One needs only to look at our river banks to
              see the environmental deficit as a result of the use of plastic.
              Many fast-flowing rivers whose levels rise rapidly during heavy
              rainfall almost have clothes lines of plastic sticking to the
              bushes that line the river banks. That is the more obvious and
              unsightly downside of the misuse of plastic. What impression does
              that picture leave with tourists, who are another scarce commodity
              in our area? There must be complete awareness of the problem, and
              we must start with the youth.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Legislation that lays out a definite timetable
              must be put in place. Plastic carrier bags, used extensively in
              the retail sector, should be phased out. Woven paper products are
              now available that rival plastic for strength. Paper, as I have
              already said, comes from an infinitely renewable source. Plastic
              designed for use in industry and agriculture should be totally
              biodegradable.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Legislation will concentrate minds, as it did
              when leaded petrol was phased out. Business and industry will come
              up with an alternative when faced with an imperative. All valued
              or troublesome waste should be categorised. The important question
              should be: &quot;Is there a destination? Is there a market?&quot;
              If not, one should be developed. Plants could be set up across
              Northern Ireland to categorise waste and incinerate it to produce
              energy and heat. Different filters for each different type of
              waste could be used to eradicate toxic waste.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is surely a ready market for compost —
              horticultural outlets and garden centres are only two examples.
              District councils have their part to play through the use of
              compost in parks and flower beds.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a high level of waste on farms and
              other agricultural establishments because of modern farming
              methods. Biogas plants, such as that proposed at Fivemiletown, are
              to be commended, but funding for that type of system is a big
              problem. The operation of biogas plants, as seen in Sweden and
              Denmark, makes a significant contribution to solving several
              environmental problems in agriculture, waste recycling and
              greenhouse gas emissions. The use of anaerobic digesters on farms,
              in agriculture industries and in sewage treatment works should be
              promoted and encouraged.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is of the utmost importance that all waste
              be made into a product. Where there is a product, there is no
              waste. People with small minds create much waste. The Assembly
              should take up the issue of utilising all waste to make a profit
              and to make Northern Ireland a healthier and more environmentally
              friendly place to live. The public should be left in no doubt that
              recycling will cost money, but it also costs money when waste is
              not recycled. It will be a cost worth paying if generations to
              come are to have a future.</p>

              welcome Dr McDonnell’s important initiative and the opportunity
              to discuss waste management. Sinn Féin recognises, and is pleased
              that others recognise, the importance of recycling as part of a
              co-ordinated waste management strategy. However, Sinn Féin
              believes that our sights must be set higher and that the highest
              possible standards must be met. On 24 October 2000, Mitchel
              McLaughlin and I tabled a motion calling on the Minister of the
              Environment to work progressively towards zero waste targets.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As political leaders and activists, many in the
              Assembly have worked closely with local communities on
              environmental and planning issues. Two important lessons have been
              learnt. The first is that collective action by communities, with
              support from the public, can achieve real and positive change and
              solve environmental problems. That leads to an overall heightening
              of public awareness of the importance of environmental issues. The
              second lesson is that environmental problems are not only local or
              national matters, but have global implications. Waste management
              must encompass not only recycling, as seen in the very good
              advertisements by the Department of the Environment, but we must
              also consider reducing the amount of waste produced, and a means
              of dealing with waste material that cannot be recycled.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last week I asked the Minister of the
              Environment, Mr Nesbitt, if he had any plans to implement the
              Waste Framework Directive (75/442/EEC), which relates to packaging
              waste. I also asked him what he proposed to do about plastic bags
              from retail grocery outlets. Each week thousands of plastic bags
              end up in landfill sites, and I called on him to introduce the
              Regulations, introduced by Noel Dempsey TD, that apply on the rest
              of the island. The charge levied on plastic bags to encourage
              their reuse and to reduce the amount going into landfill sites has
              had a significant effect across the Twenty-six Counties.
              Unfortunately, I was not too happy with the Minister’s reply.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unless we address the gap that persists between
              the rapid development in smart technology and the new economics of
              resource efficiency, Ireland will inherit a waste management
              infrastructure that was originally designed for the nineteenth
              century. Over the coming decades, our society will have to adapt.
              Zero waste represents a new planning approach and defines the
              discipline required to create a more viable pattern of interaction
              with our natural world, including the principles of conserving
              resources, minimising pollution, maximising employment
              opportunities and providing more local economic self-reliance.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The guiding principles on zero waste must be
              translated into practical policies and measures. Responsibility
              for waste management must pass from the taxpayer and local
              authorities to the manufacturers and producers of goods, who can
              ensure that the design and packaging of their products include
              plans for the recovery of the material waste. Incineration is not
              the answer. Yesterday we debated the risks of mobile phones to
              health. We must be very careful. People do not want further health
              problems or fears of the unknown.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Local authority engineers and other officers
              must be retrained to depart progressively from the landfill and
              incineration approaches to waste disposal and led to adopt a
              modernised procedure. These techniques aim to create enabling
              frameworks for producers and consumers to increase the resource
              productivity and reduce hazards through the design of products and
              processes. Manufacturers could close the loop by using materials
              collected through recycling programmes to produce new material and
              packaging; there could be initiatives to encourage households and
              businesses to reduce waste and to recycle, and a scheme could be
              introduced to bring about changes in waste disposal and recovery
              of material.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not have time to complete my speech, but
              we must establish an effective recycling agency to assess, develop
              and promote recycling —</p>

              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The responsibility for waste management has
              been split between the Department of the Environment and district
              councils for many years. There is undoubtedly a view among
              district councils that the Department dumps the problems on
              councils and takes credit for the easy bits. Fortunately that
              position has changed a little in recent years. The waste
              management strategy published two years ago is undoubtedly good.
              The problem is that it took too long to prepare and is perhaps too
              much of an overview of the situation rather than getting down to
              the practicalities.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland district councils are, by and
              large, too small to carry out the full range of waste management
              responsibilities, which is why we have three regional groups
              preparing plans. However, they are creating several problems for
              themselves because of the simple lack of co-ordination. There are
              up to a dozen district councils, with different political agendas
              and individual problems. That is why, as highlighted by the
              Committee Chairperson, the arc21 group in the eastern region
              effectively lost £1 million from last year’s budget because it
              was taking time to prepare a detailed plan rather than rushing
              into expenditure. We must learn from that. In the shire counties
              of England, it is a district council’s responsibility to collect
              waste and a county council’s responsibility to dispose of it;
              there has to be that application of scale. I am not yet convinced
              that we are starting to deal with those waste problems, although
              we are moving in the right direction.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our recycling rates are dreadful when compared
              to many other parts of the UK. District councils such as Sutton
              and Eastleigh in England are setting us a good example with
              recycling rates of three or four times those of councils in
              Northern Ireland. Of course, we have had problems. When I was
              elected to Antrim Borough Council nine years ago, the council was
              developing a plan for a new landfill site, which would have
              included a recycling facility. The council is still waiting for
              the Department — because of the regional development strategy
              — to take a decision on that plan. We must learn some of those
              lessons and get away from the environmentally and financially
              unfriendly situation of having waste transported. I thought that
              the distance between Toome and Ballyclare was long until I heard
              of waste being transported from Ballymena to Scotland. That issue
              is of concern to several councils.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of the Environment has limited
              areas of responsibility and it has, therefore, limited ability to
              influence decisions on the reuse and recycling of waste. If we had
              joined-up government in its fullest sense other Departments and
              Government agencies would use their influence to improve things.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr McDonnell gave examples of things that
              should be done. With the exception of his apparent enthusiasm for
              incineration, I would not disagree with many of them — the jury
              is still out on the validity of incineration. Undoubtedly, as
              regards the markets that need to provide outlets for recycled
              material, Departments such as Enterprise, Trade and Investment and
              Agriculture and Rural Development need to be involved.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must ensure that the spirit of recycling
              pervades the Government and is not confined merely to the
              Department of the Environment. If we do not, we will return to the
              situation from which we hope we are moving away. Mr Deputy
              Speaker, you know Mallusk as well as I do, and areas such as that
              will continue to be blighted not only by past dumping but by the
              threat of future dumping if the matter is not dealt with properly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the primary responsibility rests with
              the Department of the Environment and the district councils, we
              must look at other uses of waste by other Departments and public
              agencies, and that is why I am slightly concerned by the wording
              of Dr McDonnell’s motion. We have all more or less agreed with
              his sentiments so far, and, as I have said, there is no doubt that
              matters are moving better than they were. Indeed, Dr McCrea
              highlighted that point in his formal response on behalf of the
              Committee for the Environment. However, the precise wording of Dr
              McDonnell’s motion calls for</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the immediate establishment of an
              effective recycling agency&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">and that suggests to me that he has given up
              hope of the district councils and the Department of the
              Environment solving anything. It also suggests the potential for
              the problems associated with using another quango rather than our
              current structures.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Looking back over recent years, I can see why
              an active district councillor might have given up hope that the
              Department of the Environment would respond appropriately.
              However, from my perspective on the Committee for the Environment,
              it seems that the Minister and the civil servants appear to
              understand the problems and are attempting to work in a better
              partnership with district councils than they were previously. I
              hope that the Minister will confirm that in the debate. If he
              gives assurances that the Department will take its
              responsibilities seriously, I hope that we can join in supporting
              the sentiments of the Member who moved the motion. At the same
              time, however, it would be valuable if Dr McDonnell accepted those
              sentiments, banked them and did not push the motion to a vote. If
              he does push for a vote, the debate will become more divisive than
              it needs to be.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Boyd:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many of my constituents in South Antrim and
              indeed people throughout Northern Ireland, as Mr Ford said, have
              had to endure untold problems caused by landfill. Real
              alternatives for managing waste are long overdue. With recent
              European Union Directives on alternatives to landfill waste, we
              must prioritise an effective strategy as well as a co-ordinated
              response by the Department to manage all aspects of waste
              recycling.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am disappointed that the SDLP Member who
              moved the motion brought a wider political aspect to the debate by
              suggesting an all-Ireland agency. That is unnecessary, and we
              should focus on resolving our own waste management problems here.
              Establishing a Northern Ireland agency is what would be
              appropriate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Wake Up to Waste campaign, but we
              must provide practical solutions so that a recycling culture is
              created. I welcome the practical steps that my council in
              Newtownabbey has taken in recent years in creating a site at
              Bruslee for different types of rubbish to be recycled, including
              grass cuttings, electrical goods, metal, timber, paper and
              bottles. Each household in Newtownabbey has also been provided
              with a recycling bin for newspapers.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, not all council areas here have taken
              those steps. For example, in the north-west, only 3% of waste is
              recycled and only 1% in the council area in Londonderry. The
              Northern Ireland average for waste recycling is 7%. Contrast that
              with the Netherlands, for example, where 45% of waste is recycled.
              We clearly have much work to do to create a climate of recycling.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Each household in Northern Ireland produces
              1·4 tonnes of waste each year. It was stated recently in the ‘Belfast
              Telegraph’ that our discarded domestic rubbish could fill the
              Waterfront Hall every two weeks. At present 95% of rubbish is
              buried in landfill sites. With all the hazards associated with
              landfill, there must be alternatives. We need an agency that can
              co-ordinate the network of waste recycling and recovery facilities
              and reduce the dependency on landfill. A healthy environment is
              essential for the quality of our own lives and our children’s
              lives. We have an obligation to protect our environment.</p>

              words out of my mouth. It is important to highlight the recycling
              culture.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the recent shocking television
              advertisement, which drives home the dangers that we face if we
              continue to stuff our bins, landfill sites and countryside with
              the ugly legacy of our consumer-driven society. I thank Dr
              McDonnell for tabling the motion, because it puts a new focus on
              an important issue and educates us about the dreadful facts and
              figures that are associated with waste products.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Women’s Coalition supports the spirit of
              the motion, which focuses on recycling and a recycling agency.
              Members know that three elements in the waste management package
              must operate in tandem: reduce, reuse and recycle. We cannot
              simply focus on recycling. In order to solve the massive waste
              management problem, we must go further back in the process.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members have mentioned many different ways in
              which we could tackle the waste management problem. Other
              proposals could include an incentive scheme, whereby industry is
              given rewards, such as a green tick or a stamp or an official
              recognition, for the operation of waste reduction policies.
              Supermarkets, many of which should be commended for their work,
              could be rewarded for either a reduction in the amount of
              packaging or for the use of biodegradable packaging.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Billy Armstrong mentioned the importance of a
              greater focus on the use of energy supplies from agricultural
              waste, which is an important issue that the Committee for
              Enterprise, Trade and Investment has considered in detail. Norman
              Boyd quoted huge domestic waste figures.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Should the new agency focus only on recycling?
              Should the Assembly create a new agency, given that it is trying
              to reduce the number of agencies? Would it be better to
              co-ordinate the activities of the existing agencies? A joined-up
              government approach is necessary. There may be a role for a senior
              cross-departmental group. Whatever the correct approach is decided
              to be, and we are not saying yea or nay, it is important that
              bodies such as the advisory board of the Environment and Heritage
              Service’s waste management strategy be consulted.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The most important area to consider is best
              practice. I have nothing but praise for the work of
              non-governmental organisations. For example, in pilot schemes,
              Bryson House’s kerbside recycling project has been excellent.
              Given that such non-governmental organisations lead the field,
              they must be given solid support. The valuable work of Friends of
              the Earth and Conservation Volunteers must also be recognised. The
              councils that lead the way in recycling and waste management must
              be rewarded.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the other hand, we must spur on those
              councils that are dragging their heels. It is unfortunate that
              several councils in Northern Ireland have not got their act
              together on this issue. We need co-operation. David Ford mentioned
              that we need co-operation between non-governmental organisations
              (NGOs), local councils, Departments and, importantly, the private
              sector. We must involve the private sector so that recycling and
              waste management can become real issues on which work is
              co-ordinated. We need to change the culture that surrounds the
              issue, and treat waste properly — as a dirty word.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I fell out of bed during the early hours of
              last Thursday. It may disappoint you to know that, when I was
              abruptly awoken, my first thought was not &quot;What can be done
              about waste recycling?&quot; My thoughts were more along the lines
              of &quot;Where am I, and what am I doing here?&quot; When I got
              back into bed, I drifted back into philosophical musings, as one
              does at three in the morning. Those are very profound questions.
              Even more profound is the seminal question &quot;What am I?&quot;
              As I nursed my damaged head, the answer came to me — not in a
              flash, but I finally got there — that I am a product, wrapped in
              a package. I am — we all are — potential waste material.
              Having established a link with the motion, and before going on to
              the nitty-gritty, I shall develop that thought.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our product is our intelligence, our sensory
              perception, our emotions, our capacity to create or destroy; in
              short, it is our spirit, our soul, our life — wonderful and
              terrifying. When our souls depart, as they will, although I will
              not speculate about where, what is left is technically, in today’s
              terms, waste. As waste, it must be disposed of. Most traditional
              methods involve a landfill site or incineration; there is some
              recycling. Anthropophagy was one early form, and there have been
              some other gruesome practices. However, I will hurry on from that
              to mention the wonders of preserving life and restoring health
              through the transplantation of human organs.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that no one feels that my comments are
              crude or tasteless. I am trying to deal with a sensitive subject
              in a way that I hope will spur people into a new mode of thinking
              and that will change the widely held idea that much, perhaps most,
              of what we produce from our ever-decreasing treasure house of
              natural resources is waste. We must stop regarding as waste all
              that packaging, paper and cardboard, all those plastic bottles and
              bags, all that expanded polystyrene and bubble wrap, and all those
              tins, bottles, leftovers and &quot;worn-outs&quot;, scrapings,
              cuttings and clippings — all that stuff — that is left lying
              about when we finally get to the, sometimes tatty, product. It is
              not waste. It, too, is a product, waiting for a producer or a
              reproducer.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having got that off my too-feeble chest, I turn
              again to the motion, which calls for the establishment of an
              effective recycling agency. I am all for that. Thousands of
              statistics could be quoted, detailing the vast amount of waste
              created, how much of it is shovelled into holes in the ground to
              fester and turn poisonous, and how little of it is recycled. I
              will not go into the details of subjects about which other Members
              know more. I will give only one titbit. Aluminium is the most
              plentiful metal in the earth’s crust. It is a wonderfully useful
              material, but it is difficult and expensive in energy terms to
              mine and process. However, there are so many thousands of tonnes
              of aluminium — or should I say aluminum? — in the form of cans
              and containers in US landfill sites that it might be more
              economically viable, technologically simpler, and at least as
              environmentally friendly to mine the dumps for aluminium to
              reprocess than it is to rip more bauxite from the earth. Isn’t
              that a thought?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The need for an effective agency to direct
              recycling is blindingly obvious. This is not a local, regional or
              national issue; it is a world issue, and if the world gets it
              wrong the consequences will be dire. Despite the worthwhile
              proposals being developed by district councils and council groups
              in their waste management plans, and, despite the good work being
              done regionally, it is essential that the organisations and
              machinery be in place and the resources made available to ensure
              that the united and co-operative energies and expertise are
              combined to respond quickly and effectively to a world emergency.
              I fully support Dr McDonnell’s excellent motion.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr A Maginness:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much has been said and, I suppose, recycled in
              this debate, and I do not intend to repeat what others have
              expressed, perhaps more eloquently than I could. I assure you that
              this is not a party political point, but it is important to
              develop a strategy that involves both parts of the island. The
              problems that affect Northern Ireland affect people in the
              Republic — there is no doubt about that. A joint strategy
              between the two parts of the island, as envisaged in the
              North/South Ministerial Council meetings, is to be welcomed, and I
              know that valuable work is being done on that. I want to emphasise
              this in a non-partisan way.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We face the common problem of the accumulation
              of waste. That accumulation arises from our own success — we are
              a successful economy and are becoming more successful. Our
              economic success means more production, and more production means
              more waste. That is the reality. The industrial and agricultural
              sectors account for a great deal of the waste going into our
              watercourses, lakes, rivers and streams. That is a considerable
              problem, North and South. We must use, reuse and recycle that
              waste. For example, mushroom farming in the border counties is
              affected by a problem with waste disposal. That problem is common
              to both sides of the border. It would be common sense for us to
              pursue a cross-border, all-Ireland strategy on waste. <i>[Interruption]</i>.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I see that the Minister of the Environment has
              just wasted a glass of water, but we will not allow that to
              distract us too much.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome this thoughtful motion, which calls
              for an effective recycling agency. I endorse that, as would most,
              if not all, Members. We do require a cultural change — a
              cultural revolution — on waste. Unless we re-educate our
              citizens we will continue to add to the waste mountain that is the
              result of our affluence.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.30 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must become self-disciplining and educate
              our children in that regard. We must also put into operation ways
              and means of restricting the creation of waste at the point of
              production. In other words, we must look carefully at what we
              produce to see whether we can minimise waste and, particularly,
              packaging. We must break the link between economic production and
              waste. If we are ingenious enough to create a vibrant economy —
              which we have done and will continue to do — we are ingenious
              enough to tackle the problem at source.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need a cultural revolution. We must consider
              how to minimise waste. As Dr McDonnell has suggested, we must be
              sensitive about recycling. That can be done through an agency,
              such as Dr McDonnell suggested, and through the strategy that the
              Department of the Environment is developing. If there is anything
              that one can compliment the Department of the Environment on —
              and I am not loathe to compliment the Department of the
              Environment — it is its progressive approach to waste
              management. We must all give it our united support to free us from
              the mountain of waste.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of the Environment (Mr Nesbitt): </b>I
              thank all who contributed to the debate. It was a debate full of
              nuance, and I choose that word deliberately. I was wrestling with
              the opening words that I would use in responding to the debate.
              The words that I intended to use were: &quot;I agree with the
              sentiments&quot;. I noted that the Chairperson of the Committee
              for the Environment said that he supported the thoughts behind the
              motion. I do likewise. That is a better way of phrasing it. Mr
              Ford used the word &quot;sentiments&quot;, and Jane Morrice spoke
              of the &quot;spirit&quot; of the motion. Alban Maginness referred
              to the &quot;progressive approach&quot; of the Department. There
              is much to think about. Judging from all the comments made, we
              empathise — if that can be an embracing word — with the thrust
              of the motion.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I am concerned that it calls for the
              &quot;immediate&quot; establishment of an agency. We all want to
              assess, develop and promote every aspect of recycling waste. I am
              sure that it was not the proposer’s intention, but Jane Morrice
              commented that the motion refers only to recycling. That is
              correct, but there is more involved than recycling; there is
              reduction, recovery and recycling. One can see that there is
              support for the sentiments and the thrust of the motion, but I say
              genuinely to the proposer that I am not so sure that there is a
              totality of support for every element of it. I ask the proposer to
              think about that before he comes to his winding-up speech.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have an agency that deals with waste — the
              Environment and Heritage Service. It has a waste management unit,
              which has recently been expanded.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also have the waste management board looking
              at that. It is an independent body that was set up recently to
              bring together all the stakeholders, and its function is to assess
              and promote waste management.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must ensure that we are outcome-focused, as
              has already been said, and we must ensure that what needs to be
              done is done. I note the comments of support and the contribution
              made by the Environment Committee in the development of what needs
              to be done. We have in place the framework by which we can develop
              and bring to fruition the outcomes. If, therefore, after wide
              consultation, and, if we have a process that can potentially
              deliver, it would not be timely to interject with some new
              independent agency that would be established immediately. That
              does not reflect the tenor of the debate, and I note sentiments of
              support from Dr McDonnell.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The framework is very clear. It could be argued
              that it took a long time to prepare and deliver, but we have it
              now, and I concur with that. It wants to see waste management
              fully developed. Mr Mick Murphy said that reduction was the key
              element. Reduction, recovery, recycling, and — as has been
              mentioned by many Members — the market for recycled waste is the
              key element.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with Dr McDonnell that markets are the
              big problem, and we must find ways and means to create the markets
              to allow recycling to proceed. He appealed to the Minister to
              create the markets — and not just cry about recycling. I endorse
              every sentiment expressed in those words. The markets are the
              fundamental fulcrums around which all of this will work or not
              work.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Key stakeholders must be involved. A founding
              principle is that those who produce the waste should be involved
              in the solution. That may sound trite, but we are all part of the
              problem, and therefore we must all be part of the solution.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not tell councils that waste is their
              problem. It is a problem for us all, and we must all work
              together. Mr Ford wanted an assurance about working together, and
              I give him that assurance. We are taking the lead in implementing
              that aspect through the waste management unit in Environment and
              Heritage Service.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members referred to key targets. We must
              have a recovery of 25% of household waste by 2005. We must recover
              25% of the waste from landfill and reuse it, and we must recover
              40% by 2010. We must reduce landfill of industrial and commercial
              waste to 85% of 1998 levels, and we must bring the biodegradable
              aspect to 75% of 1995 levels.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Boyd said that we need an agency to reduce
              landfill. I totally accept that landfill must be reduced, but, in
              taking the sentiments of the debate, I am not sure that
              immediately creating a new agency would deliver the outcome we
              want, and we should be focused on outcomes.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are secondary targets, including
              end-of-life vehicles. By 2005, 85% of end-of-life vehicles must be
              recovered. By 2004, 90% of waste electrical and electronic
              equipment must be recovered. I could go on. For example, 85% of
              waste tars must be recovered by 2005.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Mr Speaker in the Chair)</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not want to bore the House with any more
              statistics. These are challenging targets for us all — the
              Assembly and the community that we represent — to fulfil.
              However, we will not fulfil those targets unless we put in place
              the mechanisms that will deliver them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us look at the actions that are needed. The
              first key action is education and awareness, which Alban Maginness
              mentioned. Dr McCrea told us that the Wake Up to Waste initiative
              was an important starting point in the campaign to challenge
              public attitudes and awareness. I thank him for those comments.
              The worst system will work if people make it work. No matter how
              good a system we have, it will not work if people are not aware of
              it. That is a key issue. Education is therefore a key priority,
              and we have been involved in that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second key action is the segregation of
              materials — the diversification away from landfill and
              segregating into waste that can be recycled. If segregation is
              achieved, that will lead to the third key action — the new
              methods of processing and treatment. Above all, however, the
              markets must be there. If they are not, it could be argued that it
              is no good having education or segregating waste. There is no good
              in having the new processing and treatment facilities if there are
              no markets to take it. That was a key point made by Dr McDonnell.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the most important elements is
              co-operation. I noted Mr Ford’s comments that this approach is
              now working. I also note that he asked that we do not push the
              motion to a vote. Perhaps it will work, because that co-operation
              has to exist not only in the Assembly but among all the key
              stakeholders. Industry, local authorities, Government and the
              voluntary sector will all play their part.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford stated that the district councils were
              too small to take on the task. I concur with that assessment. When
              I first met the members of the Waste Management Advisory Board for
              Northern Ireland, I put that question to them, and they agreed. We
              welcome the co-operation among the 26 district councils with the
              eastern, northwestern and southern regional groups. They are
              publishing plans, as Dr McCrea and others have said, for working
              throughout the region to ensure that the outcome is delivered.
              Those plans are an important part of the strategy. They will
              inform us about future decisions, the most important of which are
              about funding.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are milestones to be set and targets to
              be achieved. Monitoring and reporting are also important. It is no
              good having a plan and a target and funding unless the process is
              monitored to ensure that you are achieving what you want to
              achieve. The plans are out for consultation. They will be
              submitted to the Department in June to be deliberated upon. It is
              hoped that the plans will be published in October 2002. That is
              the target.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have already been granting money to assist
              in that regard, both last year and this year. The Waste Management
              Advisory Board has been helping us. It has three committees: one
              concerned with reduction, recycling and recovery, and another
              dealing with education. The board played an important part in the
              Wake Up to Waste campaign. I remember going home one day and
              seeing an advertisement on a bus, which bore the legend
              &quot;Mountains to Mourne&quot; — the word &quot;of&quot; had
              been replaced by the word &quot;to&quot;. The Mourne Mountains
              were in the shape of the word &quot;waste&quot;. We do not want to
              be mourning the mountains, the ones that I can see from my home on
              occasions if certain things do not get in the way. We will leave
              that for another day.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other things are happening as well. We are
              involved in the waste resources action programme, a new UK-wide
              organisation, in which Whitehall, Wales, the Scottish Executive
              and Northern Ireland are all involved as partners to provide help
              in the delivery of markets.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We hope to set up — and more detail will come
              forward in May — an industry fund through which we will provide
              money through the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment
              and the Department of the Environment as a pilot scheme to see if
              we can develop sustainable markets, which is the key element.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.45 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will briefly mention the North/South
              Ministerial Council as Alban Maginness referred to it, and it is
              important. The Belfast Agreement states that we should co-operate
              where it is to the benefit of both to so do, not for political
              purposes. I concur with that. I have met with Minister Dempsey
              several times, and we are trying to see what we can do over the
              coming months to deal with the fridges that are
              &quot;frozen&quot;, as it were, and waiting to be disposed of.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mick Murphy mentioned plastic bags. That would
              involve primary legislation to be decided on by the Treasury in
              London, so at this stage we cannot do anything about that.
              However, I note the success elsewhere, and we will monitor that
              closely. If it proves to be as beneficial as it seems, we will try
              to introduce it in Northern Ireland. Mr Ford said that the jury is
              still out. Dr McDonnell made an interesting comment about the
              large non-toxic incinerator that caused no harm and generated much
              energy. That was an interesting comment as the word
              &quot;incinerator&quot; and the other words are emotive and,
              therefore, must be treated with respect. We must not be emotional,
              and we must be measured in our tone.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, we have a blueprint and we have
              education. We need to get the segregation, the reprocessing and,
              above all, the markets. Given the markets, there will be the
              opportunity, and, given that opportunity, there will be the means.
              If we have the opportunity and the means, there will be the
              motive, and that is what we are about.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sentiments were expressed widely for the
              content of the motion. Whether it should be put to a vote or not
              is another thing. I would very much like it if we could note the
              debate and, in noting it, have the motion withdrawn. However, I
              empathise with the sentiments of Dr&nbsp;McDonnell, the
              Chairperson of the Committee for the Environment and the other
              Members who spoke.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main reason for tabling the motion — and
              it has lain on the No Day Named list for about six months — was
              to move the debate on and to retain a focus on this major issue. I
              purposely wanted to focus on what needs to be done and the
              outcomes that the Minister referred to earlier, rather than cry
              more about what needs to be done. I focused more on the industrial
              and construction side of things because the vast majority of waste
              comes from there, yet we tend to focus on the bits that we know
              best, such as domestic waste. However, I feel that if we deal with
              the big industrial waste, domestic waste will dovetail in behind.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have no difficulty with the sentiments
              expressed by some Members agreeing with the spirit of the motion,
              and I apologise if my construction of the motion was slightly
              defective. I was trying to grapple with something, and I suppose
              it is easy to agree with the spirit of the thing. I am not
              word-perfect; I am not a lawyer, and I am not an expert at
              drafting and getting these things in focus. I wanted to get
              everybody on board, to get everybody focused and for everyone to
              get a sense of ownership of what is going on out there. There is
              no real difference between us, although we may have disagreed on
              minor points.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree strongly with the reduction, reuse and
              recycling sentiments expressed by David Ford and Jane Morrice. I
              tried to deal with reuse and recycling, and I knew that other
              Members would deal with reduction. However, there is a recycling
              bottleneck, and unless there is a back door, we cannot continue to
              bung in more through the front door.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand the frustration over the proposal
              for the immediate establishment of an agency. However, I accept
              that changes are taking place, and I do not want to force a vote.
              I simply want to see some change. I do not want to see another
              landfill site on the north foreshore, which Belfast City Council
              closed and had to reopen to dump another 10 ft or 15 ft of waste.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was fascinated by what has been achieved in
              Denmark. It has an incinerator where we have the Waterfront Hall.
              It produces vast amounts of electricity, hot water and central
              heating, which are available to anyone within a one-mile radius
              who wants it. That approach probably ameliorated neighbourhood
              objections. However, it works well, and it is clean.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Dr McCrea for his generally supportive
              contribution about the minimisation of waste and sustainable
              development.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Billy Armstrong mentioned aluminium, glass,
              paper, plastic bags and the threat to health and tourism.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mick Murphy wanted to set the sights higher,
              and he referred to the earlier debate and zero waste tolerance. I
              have no difficulty in agreeing with that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">David Ford mentioned the split between the
              Department of the Environment and the district councils. That is
              one of the main points, and we must get beyond that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although Norman Boyd disagreed with me on some
              issues, I do not think that they were terribly important. We are
              trying to make progress towards something that makes a difference
              to the lorry-loads of waste that are being gathered on our streets
              every day. He reiterated one of my points, which was that 95% of
              our household waste is going into landfills.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jane Morrice mentioned the spirit of the motion
              and the incentives to promote waste reduction.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Arthur Doherty supported me well, although I
              felt threatened somewhat when he started to talk about the human
              dimension, because I was not sure whether he was going to bury,
              burn or recycle me. I do not intend to facilitate him for a little
              while. However, I welcome the fact that Mr Doherty mentioned
              aluminium, because that presents a major opportunity. It is
              connected with the high price of electricity, which is too high to
              recycle the aluminium that we have.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alban Maginness mentioned an all-island
              strategy. In reacting to the Minister’s summary, I emphasise
              that I am not making a political point; it is a practical point.
              It would make good business sense, because Derry may want to work
              with Donegal, or Newry may want to work with Dundalk. It concerns
              common purpose, not political points.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister made a grand tour of all the
              issues, and I shall not mention all the points he made. I thank
              him for being in attendance and for the detail of his response.
              However, he is on probation. On this occasion, I shall not push
              the motion to a vote. We shall revisit the motion next year and
              shall hold him to account if we do not see results in the
              meantime. I beg leave to withdraw the motion.</p>

              <p ALIGN="left"><b><font SIZE="3">Mr Paisley Jnr:</p>
              </font></b><center><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to draw to the attention of the House
              the issue of car parking provision at Garryduff Primary School in
              Ballymoney. Car parking provision at this rural primary school is
              a disaster waiting to happen if it is not addressed urgently by
              the Minister of Education, the Department of Education and the
              North Eastern Education and Library Board, where responsibility
              lies.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Garryduff Primary School is situated between
              Ballymoney and Dunloy on a stretch of rural country road where the
              traffic is fast. The school is well established and is expanding
              steadily; it has an excellent teaching reputation, a healthy
              enrolment and good examination results. However, in one regard it
              needs immediate, urgent and expeditious capital expenditure
              development.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The need for capital investment in car parking
              provision was identified over three years ago in a departmental
              focus review report, of which I am sure the Department is aware.
              The report commended the school’s teaching standards, but it
              also contained a health warning. It stated that there was a
              serious health and safety issue with regard to car parking
              arrangements for teaching staff and for parents dropping children
              off at school and collecting them. If the issue is not addressed,
              there could be a serious road traffic accident.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I emphasise that it is not the responsibility
              of the Department of Education to provide car parking facilities
              for parents. However, the Department has a duty of care and
              responsibility not only for the children in its care but also for
              the teaching and auxiliary staff. It is essential that a car
              parking facility should not only address the health and safety
              problems of the teaching and auxiliary staff but should also
              remove a danger that children must face every day. A child may not
              be knocked down or killed, but he or she could be seriously
              injured.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Urgent consideration must be given to the
              provision of minor works to this school, because it would make a
              major difference to the lives of the pupils, and parents would not
              have to face the heartache of dropping their children off at a
              dangerous school.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In June 2000, the North Eastern Education and
              Library Board made financial provision to purchase a field
              adjacent to the school to develop a car park. That transaction has
              still not taken place. In March 2000, the Roads Service stepped in
              to help the Department with the immediate problems. The Department
              for Regional Development should be commended for identifying some
              serious road hazards. I received a letter from the then Minister
              for Regional Development, Gregory Campbell. It stated:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The road safety problems at the school
              would be greatly reduced by the provision of a dedicated car park
              to provide for the safe delivery and collection of children and
              for the safe parking of teachers’ vehicles.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, no further progress was made. By
              June 2001 the Department of Education recognised that there was
              some urgency. A letter that I received from it stated:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Although the farmer has sold the site,
              this is now an urgent case, and we are actively pursuing this
              matter, and when I have something positive to report, I will write
              to you again soon.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That was almost a year ago. Parents and
              teachers believed that very little was being done. I am pleased to
              report that, at the beginning of this week, planning permission
              was given for the car park. The Department now has the choice of
              acquiring the land, which has been valued by the district valuer.
              I hope that it will acquire the land immediately. However,
              acquiring the land and obtaining planning permission is not enough
              to address the parking problem. The Department must find some
              £50,000 to deliver on the arrangement.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the Minister gets his skates on and
              moves ahead to release the money from his budget for the provision
              of the school car park.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6.00 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As in every other constituency, there is a
              backlog of minor works programmes. In the North Eastern Education
              and Library Board there are 20 million identified minor works that
              could be carried out. However, this should be given top priority
              because of the significant health and safety issues for teachers
              and school workers, and also the better quality of life for
              children going to and leaving that school. Parents would also be
              relieved that their children could be left to school without
              taking their lives in their hands as they walk across that busy
              road on the way to school.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the Minister is able tonight to
              address the disaster that is waiting to happen if money is not
              immediately identified to make this car park provision. I hope
              that the Department is able to respond positively.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Leslie:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Mr Paisley said, the risks posed by the
              haphazard parking arrangements at Garryduff Primary School have
              been a cause of concern for some considerable time. I commend the
              work that has been done by Ballymoney road safety committee, and
              also that undertaken by the board of governors of Garryduff
              Primary School, in the form of intense lobbying that has reached
              the MLAs. It has certainly hit the main target, which is the North
              Eastern Education and Library Board. We are on the brink of a
              resolution, and it will be a source of considerable relief if the
              car parking facility can be built, now that the planning
              permission is there, along with the small adjacent play area. That
              would also be a good thing, as it would focus the children’s
              attention as they are waiting to be picked up.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The road leading to the school from Ballymoney
              runs straight for some distance and, inevitably, traffic will
              reach high speeds. Vehicles coming from the opposite direction
              have to round a bend, and thus tend not to be travelling at such
              breakneck speed. They are, however, coming from a blind corner. It
              is an area where vehicles reach high speeds most of the time. I
              have occasionally complained to the Roads Service about the bumps,
              potholes and general state of disrepair of the road, although on
              the whole that does contribute a little to slowing down the
              traffic, which is probably just as well.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During its inquiry into school transport, the
              Environment Committee examined the merit of adopting the practice
              of some US states that, when a school bus has pulled in, there
              should be no overtaking of that bus until it has moved on again,
              so that children can alight and cross the road safely. School
              buses stopping outside Garryduff Primary School would be a perfect
              case study of the merits of that approach. The argument in favour
              is clear: that the traffic should be stopped so that children can
              safely cross the road. The argument against, which was put
              strongly, is that although children know that they are safe to
              cross the road from a school bus, the same does not necessarily
              apply on other occasions when they are crossing the road. The
              situation is not clear-cut. Nonetheless, there is no question
              that, where a bus is parked, traffic can be unsighted and the
              situation is dangerous. We have been fortunate that no serious
              accident has occurred.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore, I completely endorse Mr Paisley’s
              call to the Department of Education to fund the successful
              application forthwith. I trust that the Minister will give us such
              undertakings today.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Education (Mr M McGuinness): </b>I
              thank Mr Paisley Jnr and Mr Leslie for their contributions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Garryduff is a controlled primary school and
              its car parking provision is primarily a matter for the North
              Eastern Education and Library Board. The board has advised that
              the school is situated on a dangerous stretch of road, and it
              acknowledges the need for a bus turning-circle and car parking
              facilities for parents who leave and collect children at the
              school. I understand that the board consulted the Roads Service
              about possible options to address the situation, and the only
              feasible solution was for the board to acquire additional land.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The board has recently concluded negotiations
              with the owner of a plot of land adjacent to the school, and its
              purchase has been agreed — subject to certain conditions set
              down by the Valuation and Lands Agency. In the light of that, and
              following close consultation with the Roads Service, the board
              submitted a scheme to the local planning office. The planners
              requested some amendments, and those were incorporated in a
              revised scheme to which formal planning approval is pending.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The education committee of the North Eastern
              Board has approved in principle the inclusion of the scheme in the
              board’s minor works programme for this year. Provided the
              planning approval is confirmed and the conditions for the purchase
              of the land are met, the project will be brought to tender. I
              trust that the matter will be speedily expedited, and the
              understandable concerns of the local community and its
              representative will be removed.</p>
