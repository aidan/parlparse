                <font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On Tuesday 29 May Mr Dallat made a number of
                charges against me. I wish to respond by way of a personal
                statement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dallat falsely claimed that at great
                inconvenience to him I had departed the Agriculture Committee on
                Friday 25 May to electioneer in Portadown.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That comment bears no resemblance to the
                truth. The Committee minutes show that I left the meeting at
                11.27 and that, as arranged, my Deputy Chairperson continued in
                the Chair. I was involved in other business. The arrangements
                for the meeting had previously been discussed and agreed with
                members. The Committee rose at 2.54 that afternoon.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I did canvass in Upper Bann that afternoon
                but — importantly — the Agriculture Committee had risen for
                the day before I arrived.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members who wish to study the minutes of the
                Agriculture Committee meeting on Friday 25 May will see that the
                Member who made the allegations against me joined and left the
                Committee on no fewer than seven occasions, causing disruption
                to business and at one point making the meeting inquorate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Committee has met consistently throughout
                the agriculture crisis, showing leadership and giving support to
                the industry and to those involved in the fight for its
                survival. I resent an attack which questions in any way my
                efforts as Chairperson in that battle.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I point out to the Member that he will face
                legal action if he repeats the allegations outside the privilege
                of the House. This is not the first time that the Member has
                made such allegations here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I had to miss two other meetings of my
                Committee during the foot-and-mouth disease crisis — to attend
                a funeral service and to attend a memorial service for the late
                Joey Dunlop, who was one of my constituents. On each occasion I
                made appropriate arrangements with the Deputy Chairperson, and
                the Committee was kept fully informed and given notice of the
                arrangements. I have every confidence in the Deputy Chairperson’s
                ability to do his work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I take my work as a parliamentarian
                seriously. It is to be regretted that a Member who was not
                appointed to the Committee from the beginning chooses to make
                political capital from this sequence of events. Members will
                note from the minutes of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural
                Development that my record for chairing its meetings — and
                taking into account the long hours that are involved — is
                second to none. However, the Deputy Chairperson also has a job
                to do and should be given the opportunity to do it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker, I wanted to put that on the
                record.</p>
                <b>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As is customary, the Member referred to may
                say whether he wishes to accept the statement.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dallat:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased that Dr Paisley felt the need to
                offer an explanation to the Assembly, given that we were in the
                middle of the foot-and-mouth disease crisis. Now that the
                elections are over, I have no doubt that there will be no need
                to raise the issue again.</p>

                is referring to another motion on the Order Paper on the matter

                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That the Second Stage of the Game
                Preservation (Amendment) Bill [NIA 15/00] be agreed.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Game
                Preservation Act (Northern Ireland) 1928 to extend the partridge
                shooting season by one month so that it commences on 1 September
                each year. That will bring the season here in line with that in
                the rest of the United Kingdom.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amendment is in response to
                representations made by local enterprises to extend the
                partridge shooting season for commercial reasons. It is also
                supported by organisations that represent shooting interests in
                Northern Ireland. While the main areas of commercial interest
                are Rathlin Island and the Copeland Islands, I am also advised
                that several shoots would be prepared to release partridges if
                the season were extended.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1999 some 73 shoots released partridges in
                Northern Ireland. The majority are not run as businesses, but
                many sell a day’s shooting to supplement the shoot income and
                defray costs for syndicate members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have been told that a further consequence
                of the Bill might be that some local sportsmen who currently
                travel elsewhere in September might stay in Northern Ireland. It
                is not possible to estimate the economic impact of the changes
                accurately, but the British Association for Shooting and
                Conservation argues that it would contribute to the local
                economy and help to maintain the rural community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Department carried out a full public
                consultation. In addition to the Environment Committee, 370
                organisations were consulted. These included the Department’s
                statutory advisory body on nature conservation, the Council for
                Nature Conservation and the Countryside, the relevant
                environmental bodies, district councils, organisations
                representing farmers and land owners, the British Association
                for Shooting and Conservation and local shooting clubs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sixty-six responses were received — the
                great majority favoured the amendment of the 1928 Act. Four
                objections were received. The first was to blood sports in
                principle; the second was to the maturity of the birds as quarry
                in September; the third was to the premature disturbance of
                other quarry species, such as pheasant, for which the season is
                later; and the fourth was based on the need to protect the
                native grey partridge.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A few respondents, although they supported
                the Bill, also raised the issue of a possible threat of
                disturbance to other native wildlife. The Council for Nature
                Conservation and the Countryside and the environmental bodies
                outside Government did not object to the proposal. The
                Environment Committee had no objection to the proposal but asked
                for more detail on the extra revenue that might be generated and
                the additional economic and other benefits that might arise
                through increased tourism.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department’s research indicates
                considerable potential benefits for the commercial shoot
                organisers. They will attract overseas visitors and their
                families, and local providers of services such as accommodation,
                hospitality and transport will receive spin-off benefits. In the
                case of Rathlin Island, there is the potential for a syndicated
                revenue of up to £70,000 for the month. Additional benefits of
                up to £200 a head by way of costs incurred by shooters for
                travel, bed and breakfast and entertainment might also accrue.
                Most of this would benefit the local economy. In the case of the
                Copeland Islands syndicate, the estimates are for four extra
                shoots at £3,500 a day during September. These are likely to be
                taken up completely by visitors from the USA who would stay
                locally.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In bringing this legislation forward, I took
                full account of the concerns raised in the consultation. First,
                the question of blood sports falls outside the scope of the
                Bill. Secondly, with regard to the maturity of the birds, I have
                been advised that the eggs are usually laid in April or May to
                allow the birds time to mature and adapt to the wild. The birds
                would normally be mature in September. However, as all the birds
                are artificially reared, it would be the responsibility of the
                game managers and shoot organisers to ensure that they release
                only fully-grown birds and that these birds are released into
                conditions that are conducive to good sporting practices. It is
                not in their interests to release immature birds, which make
                easy prey and will bring the sport into disrepute.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third issue of concern is that the
                changes would create a premature disturbance to other quarry
                birds. This matter cannot be addressed directly by my
                Department. It is the responsibility of game managers to ensure
                that, under the terms of the code of good shooting practice,</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;shooting should not commence until all
                birds are mature and fully adapted to the wild&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I am advised that the possible upset
                to other quarry is minimal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The last point concerns the native partridge.
                I have been advised that it is now accepted that there are no
                native grey partridges in the wild, and it is highly unlikely
                that they will be re-established in the foreseeable future.
                Sufficient suitable habitat no longer exists for them, and
                current farming practices militate against creating such
                habitats. I understand that there are only a few native
                partridges left in the island of Ireland as a whole and that
                those that are left can be found only in the Republic of
                Ireland. The remaining population is not expected to survive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the possible threat to native
                wildlife, several protective measures exist under wildlife
                legislation. In particular, some Members have raised concerns
                about the level of protection that is afforded to the Irish
                hare. I announced a species action plan for the Irish hare, to
                be implemented by a number of Departments including my own, the
                Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, and the Ulster
                Wildlife Trust. The plan includes a repeat survey of hares,
                which will be commissioned once the current foot-and-mouth
                disease restrictions have been lifted. Upon completion of the

                taken.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Environment Committee
                (Rev Dr William McCrea):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for introducing the
                Bill. Members are looking forward to the discussions that will
                follow at Committee Stage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last September the Committee considered a
                consultation document issued by the Department of the
                Environment on extending the partridge shooting season. While we
                generally welcomed that proposal we did have some questions on
                the extent of the financial benefits arising from it. We still
                await the Department’s response to those questions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee has already received detailed
                representations on the Bill from the Countryside Alliance in
                Northern Ireland and the British Association for Shooting and
                Conservation. Both organisations expressed disappointment at the
                proposed changes to the shooting of rabbits and concern at the
                proposed legislative process by which the Minister may make
                future changes to the closed season. The Committee takes the
                concerns that have been expressed seriously and will take the
                necessary step to permit appropriate consultations with it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Apart from these issues, the Committee wants
                to know why the original consultation document seen by the
                Committee made reference only to extending the partridge
                shooting season and yet the Bill proposes several other
                amendments to the 1928 Act. The Committee will be interested to
                learn what consultations there have been on these proposals. The
                Minister gave the number of consultations to the House today,
                but consultation with my Committee extended only to the
                partridge shooting season and not to the other measures which
                now appear in the Bill. The Minister can be assured, however,
                that the Committee will look diligently at the details in the
                Bill and will come back with any necessary amendments at
                Consideration Stage.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Environment
                Committee (Ms Hanna):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Deputy Chairperson of the Environment
                Committee and on behalf of the SDLP, I welcome the Minister’s
                statement and concur with some of the points raised by Dr McCrea.
                I am concerned by the change effected by clause 1(3), which will
                allow the Minister to vary the closed season for all types of
                hare, grouse and other birds by ministerial Order rather than by
                legislation before the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clause 2 of the Bill deals with the shooting
                of rabbits on agricultural land. Many people regard rabbits as
                pests, and I have noted submissions from various lobbying groups
                that welcome the more permissive proposals that allow an
                extended time for shooting rabbits. However, I want to sound a
                note of caution: rabbits are pests to many people, but they are
                also part of God’s creation. I have reservations about any
                measure that could bring about the extinction of a species and
                have an adverse effect on ecology, biodiversity and variety of
                fauna. Are we clear that the extinction of rabbits is not an
                issue?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the grounds of maximum possible
                accountability, I am concerned about clause 3’s making orders
                under the Act subject to negative resolution — perhaps the
                Minister will elaborate on that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will end on a light historical note. In the
                51-year history of the Stormont parliament, the Unionist
                Government accepted only one amendment to a Bill from the
                Opposition, in the 1930s. It was an amendment proposed by a
                Nationalist MP to a measure for protecting wild birds, and it
                was unexpectedly accepted by the Unionist Minister. That caused
                some consternation at the time.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not sure what I should say in response
                to the point that Ms Hanna has just made. Perhaps if Dr McCrea,
                Ms Hanna and I can all agree, the Minister will find it easier
                to accept any views that may come from the Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also welcome the Bill, but I concur with
                many of the concerns that my Colleagues from the Committee have
                just raised.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In particular, I find it somewhat unhelpful
                when the memorandum relating to a Bill says that departmental
                research foresees economic benefits, but gives absolutely no
                quantification whatsoever as to what those benefits might be. It
                is not acceptable for a memorandum accompanying a Bill to make
                such a general statement and give no specific reference to what
                the perceived benefits are. If we are going to have a
                memorandum, we really ought to ask all Departments — and it
                just happens to be the Department of the Environment on this
                occasion — to ensure that the memorandum spells out what they
                are talking about. Unfortunately, this one has come along with a
                lot of other loose, woolly phrases that the Committee has seen
                and which were included in the consultation. It really is time
                that these issues were tightened up rather better.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the fact that the Minister actually
                noted the hare as one of the game species. The fact that he is
                now recognising that may mean that the concerns that people such
                as Mr Poots, Mr Wells and I have over hare coursing may
                gradually start to be addressed in this Assembly. It is clear
                that this remains a problem. I disagree with Ms Hanna in that I
                believe that the rabbit is a pest — several rabbits are
                definitely pests and several hundred rabbits are huge pests. We
                need to regard the hare, which is a native animal, in a
                different light. The rabbit, however, is an import from the
                adjacent island, and I would therefore have assumed that the
                SDLP would not have wanted it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On clause 2 and the reference to shooting
                rabbits, is the Minister entirely happy that he now has adequate
                definitions of words such as &quot;agricultural land&quot; and
                &quot;occupier&quot;? Given the difficulties experienced at
                Westminster, particularly under the Countryside and Rights of
                Way Act 2000, where there are huge problems in defining
                &quot;agricultural land&quot;, is he satisfied that the
                Department of the Environment here is rather better than the
                Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food was over there?
                Similarly, given the differences in land tenure — conacre and
                so on — is he absolutely satisfied with what the term
                &quot;occupier&quot;, in relation to land, means?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These are some of the issues that we will
                need to look at in detail in the Committee. We can welcome the
                Bill in principle, but in practice, the Committee has a great
                deal to do on it.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Leslie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad to see that amendments to shooting
                seasons are something that we can contemplate in legislation. It
                is a long time since they were changed. While I have
                reservations about this particular change, I think it is
                important that this matter be always kept under review and that
                we be alert to it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My particular interest in this is that I
                rear, shoot and eat partridges — the last of those activities
                is the most pleasant, but I enjoy all three. On the subject of
                these rather elusive economic benefits, in sympathy to the
                Minister they are very elusive indeed, and they are not relevant
                to the argument or the issue. I can assure you that there is no
                economic benefit to me in rearing partridges — quite the
                opposite.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cast back to the 1928 debate here, and more
                particularly the debate down the Corridor when this Bill was
                introduced, to see what rationales were advanced at that time.
                It is interesting to note that then, too, there was concern
                about the decline in the numbers of the native grey partridge,
                which even then was a consequence of declining habitat. Despite
                considerable efforts by the shooting fraternity, this decline
                was probably complete by the end of the 1960s. Sadly, there do
                not seem to be any left here now. A few years ago the Department
                of Agriculture introduced a scheme to encourage and provide some
                assistance for people to reintroduce grey partridges, but this
                has proved to be exceedingly hard work. However, I hope that
                initiatives to do that will continue. This Bill, by giving some
                cognisance to the interests of people rearing partridges, may
                provide some further encouragement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also believe that the countryside
                management scheme that has been introduced by the Department of
                Agriculture and Rural Development will make a major contribution
                towards improving habitat. The debate about the future of the
                rural economy and farming is growing louder all the time. In
                that context, I trust that a move to more
                environmentally-friendly farming policies, along with the
                reclaiming for nature of a great deal of land that has been
                claimed for agriculture, will contribute to the kind of habitat
                in which it will be possible — if one takes a reasonably
                long-term view — to get partridges successfully breeding again
                in the wild.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, if we continue to protect all
                predators, particularly raptors, it will prove to be as
                difficult for the partridge population as it is for the grouse
                population.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hesitate in regard to the lengthening of
                the partridge season because while partridges in Hampshire may
                be fully grown by 1 September, it is much more difficult to
                achieve that in Northern Ireland, particularly during a wet
                year. I understand from people involved in rearing partridges in
                large numbers that eggs need to be imported from the continent
                in order that the birds can hatch and be fully grown by 1
                September. However, the shooting fraternity self-regulates
                exceedingly well; therefore I hope that we can trust its
                judgement from year to year, depending on the rearing season. I
                welcome the Minister’s comments about that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The season for shooting pheasants starts on 1
                October. Few pheasants are shot in Northern Ireland before the
                last week of October. The people involved in that activity know
                that they need a few more weeks here before pheasants are fully
                reared, though they might be shot in the early part of October
                in the south of England. I trust that the self-regulatory
                disciplines of the shooting community will work in that respect.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill does not distinguish between native
                grey partridges and imported red partridges, though it is
                appropriate to have the undefined term. Along with other
                Members, I am concerned that in clause 1(3) the Minister
                reserves the right to amend shooting seasons by Order. Although
                it has not been the case in the past, it might be an excessive
                burden if legislation were passed frequently. Widespread
                consultation is important, and the House should be given the
                opportunity to deliberate fully on any future changes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I concur with other Members that the
                definition of &quot;agricultural land&quot; in clause 2 is wrong
                — we need a broader term. The other rules that regulate where
                one can shoot will provide the necessary protection to persons
                and property. All of the matters that I have raised can be
                addressed satisfactorily in Committee. I hope that there is some
                degree of consensus among Members, and I look forward to dealing
                with those matters during the Consideration Stage.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s statement and
                thank him for his time and effort. Approximately four years ago,
                many of the shooting organisations and conservation bodies
                approached elected representatives to push for a change in the
                legislation to bring forward the season for partridge shooting.
                I agree that there are benefits, though some Members may not. In
                my constituency, partridge shooting is a pastime, and these
                birds are used, together with pheasants, to try to increase the
                potential for many of the shoots. We should welcome that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Strangford, the constituency I represent,
                enjoys sporting, tourism and economic benefits as a direct
                result of partridge shooting. The Copeland Islands, just outside
                my constituency, are used purely for partridge shooting, and
                this attracts tourists. Shoots on these islands are
                oversubscribed, and it is hoped that the existing potential for
                developing tourism can be increased. If permission were granted
                for an additional four days’ shooting in September, it would
                be possible, as the Minister has stated, to make around £3,000
                on each of those days.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rathlin Island, in Dr Paisley’s
                constituency, is another area where partridge shooting could be
                promoted to enhance the area’s potential for a growth in
                tourism. The shoot in Rathlin Island was recently featured in
                ‘Shooting Times and Country Magazine’, which is distributed
                throughout the UK and further afield. An advertisement listing
                the shooting dates for Rathlin Island which are available for
                booking was published in tandem with the feature.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A partridge shoot also takes place in
                Portaferry, in my constituency. If it were to begin in September
                the area would receive direct economic and tourism benefits.
                Partridge and pheasant shoots also take place in Rosemount in
                Greyabbey, and the extension of the shooting season by one month
                would provide extra potential. Dunleath estate in Ballywalter is
                a third example of such activity in my constituency. Ards
                Borough Council, of which I am a member, supported the
                legislation relating to this type of shooting.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Direct benefits are gained from visitors’
                staying overnight in the locality, with the result that bed-and-
                breakfast accommodation, hotels, restaurants and country sport
                shops all profit. Tangible gains are made as a result of this
                activity. Shooting can and does create benefits. The countryside
                needs the creation of this tourism potential and economic
                benefit more than ever, therefore we should support this Bill. I
                am glad that there seems to be a consensus on this matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The maturity of the birds was mentioned.
                There is no reason why appropriate management cannot ensure that
                birds mature on 1 September so that partridge shooting can take
                place. Sportsmen understand the issues involved, and if the
                birds had not matured to a suitable standard, they would not
                shoot at that time. I think that they will be mature, and
                management is in place to ensure that this is the case. There
                will be clear benefits for everyone by 1 September.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister is probably already aware of
                section 7(a) of the Game Preservation Act (Northern Ireland)
                1928, about which myself and other Members are concerned. The
                Minister will agree that all legislation must be clear and
                reasonable. This paragraph is neither entirely clear nor
                completely reasonable. It relates to the shooting of rabbits on
                agricultural land, and uses the wording</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Provided that this section shall not
                render unlawful the shooting of rabbits on any agricultural
                land&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There seems to be a grey area, because some
                landowners in Northern Ireland do not own the shooting rights to
                their land and are not, therefore, in a position to authorise
                third parties. I am sure that the Minister would agree with
                this. The position in Northern Ireland is slightly different:
                while an occupier may have permission to harvest a crop off a
                piece of land, he may not have the authority to let people on to
                his land to shoot rabbits and control vermin. The wording of
                section 7(a) of the Game Preservation Act (Northern Ireland )
                1928 should be changed to,</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Provided that this section shall not
                render unlawful the shooting of rabbits at any time by
                authorised persons&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Such wording would ensure that the
                legislation is clear, reasonable and of benefit to landowners
                and those with the shooting rights of the land.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the legislation and the efforts
                that have been made to create it. We have waited four years for
                this, therefore it is good to know that on 1 September partridge
                shooting on Rathlin Island, Copeland Islands, Rosemount,
                Ballywalter, Portaferry and other estates can be taken advantage
                of and that tourism potential and economic benefit can be
                created in all the boroughs and constituencies involved.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Carson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the opportunity that the Game
                Preservation (Amendment) Bill gives us to redress parts of the
                Game Preservation Act (Northern Ireland) 1928. The amendment in
                clause 1(2) will extend the shooting season for partridges to
                commence on 1 September annually, and this will bring Northern
                Ireland into line with the rest of the United Kingdom, as
                partridge shoots commence in England, Scotland and Wales on that
                date.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Evidence so far suggests that with
                appropriate management, partridges can be fully mature on 1
                September. As everyone knows, wild grey partridges are extinct
                here, so there should be no basis for any objections for
                sustainable conservation on that score.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The change to the close season will also
                create a positive incentive for conservation by encouraging more
                landowners to rear and release partridges in the wild, which
                enhances the commercial sustainability of shoots, making a
                much-needed contribution to our rural economy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This legislation should end the confusion
                about the legal position on shooting rabbits at night-time and
                on Sundays, but it contains some unclear references. The
                reference to &quot;agricultural land&quot; that has been
                mentioned several times already should be removed. Land types
                are difficult to define in law, and, as we all know, rabbits do
                not confine themselves to just that. Any reference to a specific
                land type only compounds the lack of clarity the Bill is
                attempting to redress.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Present firearms legislation is strict and
                clearly governs where shooting may take place. The terminology
                used to describe people permitted to shoot rabbits should be
                &quot;any authorised persons&quot;. Many people have pointed out
                that some land occupiers do not own the shooting rights to the
                land, and they would not be in a position to give authority for
                third persons to shoot over it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clause 1(3) gives powers to the Minister to
                vary the close season in relation to any kind of game, and that
                causes me concern. I urge that a clause be included in the
                legislation to ensure that there is consultation with relevant
                bodies and organisations before any variation to a close season
                takes place. That would allow a wide range of expertise to
                contribute to discussions on any change to the close season so
                that the most sensible option is chosen.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also concerned about Orders made by the
                Minister being subject to negative resolution. That would
                curtail any debate in the Assembly. Negative resolution must be
                changed to affirmative resolution to ensure what we all want —
                open and transparent Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the Minister will consider these
                points when wording the final Bill.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M Murphy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.
                While supporting the Bill, I would like the Chairperson of the
                Environment Committee to reserve the matter until it reaches its
                Final Stage. I have difficulty with some of the terminology
                used.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Not all landowners own the shooting rights to
                their land and not all, therefore, are in a position to
                authorise a third party to shoot. There are particular means of
                letting land to a conacre, where the occupier has permission to
                take a crop, but in many instances he is not able to authorise
                just anyone to shoot on his land. The current wildlife
                legislation uses the term &quot;authorised persons&quot; to
                describe a broad spectrum of people who may shoot on certain
                lands. That is clearly defined in the Wildlife (Northern
                Ireland) Order 1985. I strongly recommend that similar
                terminology be used in the Game Preservation (Amendment) Bill. I
                will wait until the Final Stage to say anything more. Go raibh
                maith agat.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Foster:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Members for their comments, which
                have been very useful and have teased out many issues that we
                will look at. This is not a complex piece of legislation, and it
                has widespread support, particularly from people with an
                interest in game sport. We expect that it will bring some
                financial benefit locally, and it is widely accepted that it
                poses no threat to nature conservation. It also brings the
                partridge season here into line with the rest of the UK, and it
                should be seen as the Assembly’s responding positively to
                modest representations for a change that reaps some benefit to
                the rural economy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rural economy issues are important at all
                times, but particularly so at present with the crisis in farming
                and tourism. Providing a sustainable basis for the rural economy
                is vitally important. Some very interesting points have been
                made, and I will try to address some of the questions raised by
                Members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the Minister’s being able to
                make future amendments to the close season for all types of game
                by Order, there was a view that the provisions of the Game
                Preservation (Northern Ireland) Act 1928 allowed for any changes
                to the close seasons to be affected by subordinate legislation,
                although this was not absolutely clear. Therefore, in order to
                clear up any such confusion, the proposed amendment to section
                7(3) of the 1928 Act will allow me to make future amendments to
                the close season for all types of game by Order. The use of
                subordinate legislation procedures of course carries the
                requirement to consult publicly, and that includes the
                Environment Committee, which was Mrs Carson’s point.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The benefit of this proposal is that I will
                be able to make minor changes such as the present extension
                proposal without recourse to the lengthy and costly primary
                legislation procedure, which is designed for more major and
                complicated issues. This was seen as a technical amendment and
                was not included in the consultation. I apologise if Members
                thought that this was inappropriate, and I will note it for the
                future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reference was made to the threat to the
                rabbit population. I have been advised that there is no
                perceived threat to rabbits, and, in fact, their numbers are
                possibly increasing slightly. If there were ever any evidence of
                rabbit extinction, I would take appropriate steps to protect
                them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the change to the description of persons
                who can lawfully shoot rabbits on agricultural land, the 1928
                Act restricts the lawful shooting of rabbits on any agricultural
                land to the occupier or any person resident with or employed by
                him. This reflects the nature and culture of landowning at the
                time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposed change is now to allow the
                shooting of rabbits by a person so authorised by the occupier or
                owner. This change brings the legislation into line with the
                current practice where landowners or occupiers may give
                permission, or may ask a person who is expert in this field, to
                shoot pest rabbits. Since the change is of a minor and
                uncontentious nature, it was not included in the consultation
                process. I recognise the points that have been made about the
                definition of &quot;agricultural land&quot; and will take this
                issue on board.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reference was also made to the financial
                aspects. The syndicate which has the shooting rights on Rathlin
                Island, in support of the argument in the change of the
                legislation, stated that it could mean up to an extra £70,000
                as well as some spin-off for the local economy by way of travel,
                accommodation, meals and entertainment. As a result of
                subsequent enquiries, my officials estimated the possible
                potential revenue for Rathlin Island as being 10 days for 10
                people at £350 a day per person, giving a figure of £35,000.
                There would also be additional revenue by way of accommodation,
                meals and entertainment and, while it is difficult to put a
                precise figure on it, this was estimated to be in the region of
                £150 to £200 per person, which would represent an additional
                £15,000 to £20,000.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the case of the Copeland Islands
                syndicate, the market clients are largely from the USA and are
                normally accompanied by their families. This syndicate was
                planning an additional four days of shooting at £3,500 per
                party per day. There would be associated revenue by way of
                accommodation, meals, and so on, which could be broadly similar
                to that for Rathlin Island. Therefore there are additional
                benefits as far as those groups are concerned.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some people referred to the immaturity of
                birds. The advice given to me, and to Members, is that no
                responsible manager would release birds if they were immature.
                My officials advise me that normally the birds are mature in
                September. The eggs are usually laid in April and May, which
                allows time for maturity and adaptation to the wild. The Bill
                has not been opposed by the Council for Nature Conservation and
                the Countryside, by my Department’s statutory adviser on
                nature conservation matters or by the majority of other people
                consulted. In addition, the Bill has the support locally of the
                British Association for Shooting and Conservation and other
                shooting interests.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware of some concerns in different
                places, and I am glad that those issues have been teased out.
                The Department of the Environment will take them into
                consideration. I hope that I have addressed some of the
                questions raised by Members. I am sorry if any questions or
                points have been overlooked, but departmental officials will
                scrutinise Hansard, and I will write to anyone whose question
                has not been fully answered.</p>

                for Higher and Further Education, Training and Employment I have
                agreed that an alternative formulation would be more acceptable.
                Therefore I have tabled five amendments which alter the order of
                the words &quot;Learning&quot; and &quot;Employment&quot;. The

                Bill has a kind of rose-by-any-other-name aspect to it, I am
                pleased to support the amendments. The Committee always
                supported the principle of the name change and has been assured
                that the cost implications will be contained to under £15,000.
                The Committee accepts the inadequacy of the existing, unwieldy
                title and its unfortunate associated acronym.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the Committee was not convinced by
                the option of &quot;Department for Learning and Employment&quot;
                contained in the original Bill. The amended title,
                &quot;Department for Employment and Learning&quot;, is better.
                It avoids any potential for the acronym DOLE. It also avoids the
                usage of the cumbersome &quot;ƒ&quot; used by the Department
                for Education and Employment in London (DFEE), which has become
                a casualty of the latest restructuring of Government in
                Whitehall. The amendment leads to the acceptable and easily
                remembered shorthand of DEL.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee recommended amendment number
                one. There was unanimous agreement on that. One Member recorded
                a preference that the word &quot;training&quot; be retained in
                the title.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The working together of the Committee and the
                Minister on the amendments demonstrates consensus politics in
                action. The Committee supports the amendments. We suggest that
                it would be advantageous if all stages of the Bill could be
                completed by the summer recess. That would allow the Department
                and the Committee, under the new names, to progress with the
                real work in hand.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister and his officials for
                their meaningful and helpful input to the Committee Stage of the
                Bill. I also thank the Deputy Chairman for progressing the Bill
                through the Committee Stage in my absence. I support the
                amendments.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hay:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the Minister and the amendments. I
                also want to put on record the good work carried out by the
                Committee Chairperson and by the Deputy Chairperson, Mervyn
                Carrick. That was important in reaching an accommodation with
                the Minister before the matter came to the Floor of the House.
                We all agree that the old title was clumsy. It was difficult for
                everyone in the Assembly and in the Department.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department is responsible for so many
                issues in such a varied portfolio that it was always going to be
                difficult to shorten the name. At various stages in the
                Committee some members thought that the training aspect should
                be reflected in the new title. It was difficult to shorten the
                name and still try to cover the Department’s entire remit. The
                old title had five words, and now we are down to three.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee and the Minister have managed
                to reach an accommodation on this matter. I welcome that.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Farren:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Members who have spoken and, in
                particular, I thank the Chairperson of the Committee and
                Assembly Member William Hay for their support.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will appreciate that the amendments
                before them have, in effect, the same purpose as the Bill
                itself. My officials and I deliberated at great length over what
                the new name of the Department should be. We identified a number
                of options, including &quot;the Department of Learning and
                Employment&quot;. This was rejected because it resulted in the
                acronym DOLE, which the Chairperson of the Committee has already
                mentioned. &quot;The Department of Advanced Learning and
                Employment&quot; was another option. That highlighted our
                involvement with higher education but did not adequately reflect
                our training and basic skills provision. This process continued
                for a number of months with various options being identified and
                then rejected for one reason or another. The new title proposed
                by these amendments effectively and equitably represents each of
                the key areas of the Department.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department’s staff are drawn from the
                Training and Employment Agency, which is an agency of the former
                Department of Economic Development, and the higher and further
                education divisions of the former Department of Education.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The new name portrays the image of a cohesive
                Department, as opposed to one made up of separate parts. It
                creates a shorter, more manageable title and, I trust Members
                will agree, a more marketable acronym.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On costs, I am happy to repeat the assurances
                that I gave during the Second Stage of the Bill. The main costs
                of the change are associated with stationery and signage. They
                are unlikely to exceed £15,000. The Department has purposely
                ordered only small stocks of stationery, and a large proportion
                of the Department still uses Training and Employment Agency
                stationery. The cost of changing the Department’s seal is
                around £150, and the signage currently in the Department’s
                headquarters costs around £200. I am aware of the Committee’s
                concerns on this issue, which arise from the costs of rebranding
                the jobcentres following the introduction of New Deal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to assure Members that I have no
                plans, and there is no need, to rebrand jobcentres as a result
                of this change.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the amendments, I am happy
                that the Committee for Higher and Further Education, Training
                and Employment and I are in agreement, and I thank the members
                of the Committee for their time and effort during the Committee
                Stage of the Bill.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for
                Agriculture and Rural Development (Rev Dr Ian Paisley):</p>
                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the Committee for Agriculture and Rural
                Development met on 15 June I was asked to make a statement on
                its behalf. Following the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment’s request for comments on the proposals in the
                Bill, we considered how these matters might affect agricultural
                producers and the fishing industry in particular. The Committee
                was most concerned about a number of aspects.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Everyone knows the dire straits that farmers
                and fishermen are in these days. Many are facing financial ruin
                because of BSE, foot-and-mouth disease and cod closures, among
                other things. Members do not need me to tell them that. It has
                been voiced over and over again at length in this Chamber and
                elsewhere. On top of all these problems comes a Bill
                implementing yet another EC Directive that will leave food
                producers, farmers and fishermen wide open to be sued by
                consumers who feel that they had been affected by food that was
                defective in some way. The ramifications of a successful claim
                against the producers do not bear thinking about. The potential
                cost of extra insurance and other measures to protect themselves
                is yet another straw to break the camel’s back.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee was most disappointed to see
                that those who will be directly affected by this Bill have not
                been consulted. I can imagine what their response would have
                been. It seems that when Brussels issues a decree, it must be
                implemented without question. Not only have those affected not
                been consulted, but they were not told about the Bill’s
                provisions and the implications and potential consequences for
                them.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee sought and received an
                assurance from the Department of Agriculture and Rural
                Development that everyone involved in agricultural production
                and the fishing industry would be made aware of possible
                repercussions and any additional costs that would arise.
                Therefore, I am pleased that in its report on the Bill, the
                Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment has taken on
                board my Committee’s concerns about the additional costs and
                ramifications of successful claims. The report comments on the
                lack of consultation and the need to inform those affected. I
                trust that the Minister in charge of this Bill will urge his
                Colleague to take appropriate action.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Finance and Personnel (Mr
                Durkan):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate and accept the concerns that the
                Member has raised on behalf of the Committee for Agriculture and
                Rural Development. I thank members of that Committee for giving
                consideration to this issue. In particular, I thank the members
                of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment for their
                scrutiny of this short Bill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must recognise that the timing of this
                Bill is far from ideal, as it comes in the wake of the foot-and-
                mouth disease crisis and in the context of the various pressures
                on fisheries. However, as the Member will realise, we have no
                option but to implement the European Directive that is the
                subject of this Bill. The Executive has had no choice in policy
                on this matter. However, evidence from other countries that
                already have this provision in force reveals no significant
                increase in costs to farmers or other affected groups. Nor is
                there any evidence of an avalanche of claims resulting from
                increased liability.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Consultation revealed that the vast majority
                of farmers already carry adequate cover for product liability.
                Therefore, this extension should not cause many of them any
                onerous additional burden. I can assure Dr Paisley that, before
                the Bill was introduced, my officials wrote to many interested
                parties in Northern Ireland alerting them to the need for this
                legislation. One response was received, and it was positive.
                There is a realisation that measures such as these, which are
                designed to restore public confidence in food safety, are of
                long-term benefit to producers as well as consumers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can give the Assembly the assurance that Dr
                Paisley’s Committee and the Committee for Enterprise, Trade
                and Investment have sought. My Department, in conjunction with
                colleagues in the Department of Agriculture and Rural
                Development, will ensure that those who could be affected by
                this Directive are made aware of the consequences and advised to
                take out any additional insurance cover that may be necessary.</p>

                important piece of legislation that will make provision for
                Northern Ireland corresponding to provision made for Great
                Britain by the Social Security Fraud Act 2001. In Northern
                Ireland alone, an estimated £73 million per annum of public
                money is lost due to benefit fraud. By anybody’s standards,

                through deterrence, through the powers to restrict payments to
                persistent benefit offenders and the swift, effective punishment
                of collusive employers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Social security Bills are, by definition,
                exceptional. The unique position of social security, child
                support and pensions is specifically recognised in the very Act
                that set up the Assembly, and from which its legislative
                competence is drawn.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under section 87 of the Northern Ireland Act
                1998, I, as the Minister responsible for social security in
                Northern Ireland, am under a duty to consult with the Secretary
                of State with a view to maintaining single systems of social
                security, pensions and child support for the United Kingdom.
                That section recognises the long-established principle of parity
                in social security between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
                People in Northern Ireland pay the same rates of income tax and
                National Insurance contributions as those in Great Britain. They
                are entitled to enjoy the same rights and benefits as people in
                Great Britain.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The cost of paying benefits in Northern
                Ireland is very heavily subsidised by Great Britain. For
                example, in 1998-99, the Northern Ireland insurance fund needed
                a transfer of £123 million from Great Britain just to meet its
                benefit obligations. In the same period, expenditure on
                non-contributory income-related benefits, which are demand-led
                and financed from taxation revenue, amounted to almost £2
                billion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This funding is predicated on the maintenance
                of parity, which I hope all parties in the House are aware of
                and fully understand. However, parity is a double-edged sword.
                Rights to benefits must be matched by obligations to society. If
                it is right that we should enjoy the same rights and benefits as
                people in Great Britain, it is equally right that we should play
                our part in tackling the problem of benefit fraud.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In line with section 87 of the 1998 Act, I
                have already consulted the Secretary of State and agreed that I
                should bring the necessary legislation before the Assembly.
                Parity covers not only the content of the legislation, but also
                the timing of its implementation. To ensure that certain
                proposals in the Bill are implemented at the same time as in
                Great Britain, the necessary powers must be available as soon as
                possible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ministers in Great Britain are eager to
                commence several provisions of the Social Security Fraud Act
                2001 as a matter of urgency, particularly the section dealing
                with failure to notify changes of circumstances, which closes a
                loophole in the existing legislation. It is currently difficult
                to prosecute fraudulent claimants who have been paid by
                automated credit transfer (ACT) and who fail to declare a change
                of circumstances. That is because, unlike payment by giro or
                order book, such clamaints need not sign a declaration that
                there has been no change of circumstances before receiving their
                benefit payment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clause&nbsp;15 of the Bill would rectify this
                situation. The ability to prosecute fraud where the claimant is
                paid by ACT will be severely compromised until that provision is
                introduced. Ministers in Great Britain have delayed implementing
                their Act to allow the Assembly time to consider the Bill.
                Failure to grant accelerated passage will probably delay the
                Bill until the end of this year or the beginning of next. That
                will leave the loophole for ACT payees open. Ministers in Great
                Britain will probably be unable to delay implementation of their
                Act until then. This will lead to a break in parity, which is
                clearly unacceptable. It will lead to a situation where in
                certain circumstances fraudsters could be prosecuted in Great
                Britain but not in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It will also be difficult to expect the Great
                Britain National Insurance fund to continue to bail us out if we
                delay taking the necessary steps to close the loophole as a
                matter of urgency. Therefore I am seeking the leave of the
                Assembly to use the accelerated passage procedure set out in
                Standing&nbsp;Order 40(2) to bring Northern&nbsp;Ireland law on
                these matters into line with Great&nbsp;Britain with the minimum
                of delay.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The granting of leave for the accelerated
                passage procedure means that there will be no formal Committee
                Stage. I have already met with the Social Development Committee
                to outline the provisions of the Bill and to discuss some issues
                arising from it. I have taken on board the Committee’s
                comments on the use of information powers, and I have arranged
                for a draft code of practice that will govern the use of powers
                to be made available to the Committee. I have also arranged for
                the draft code of practice to be made available for Members in
                the Library. The draft code will also be published for public
                consultation. Members will have the opportunity to make their
                views known at Second Stage and Consideration Stage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Members will appreciate, social security
                Bills are a regular feature of the Assembly’s legislative
                programme. A decision on whether to seek leave to use the
                accelerated passage procedure will be taken on an individual
                Bill basis, bearing in mind the duty placed on me under section
                87 of the Northern&nbsp;Ireland Act 1998 to seek to maintain
                single social security, child support and pensions systems. The
                fact that we are attempting to use the accelerated passage
                procedure today in no way prohibits Members present from raising
                issues with regard to the Bill. It simply means that the Bill
                will not have a Committee Stage.</p>

                Féin is opposed to social security fraud. We are particularly
                opposed to the organised social security fraud that is costing
                £73&nbsp;million. As the Minister said, £73&nbsp;million is a
                massive amount of money to be dealing with. We could be using
                that money in other ways.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members have the right to be able to
                scrutinise the Bill and to put forward effective amendments. The
                Minister has not given a good argument for accelerated passage,
                which is a bad method of putting any Bill through the Assembly.
                There are particular problems in the Bill, and every Member
                should have the opportunity to scrutinise it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It could affect people’s human rights and
                invade their privacy. Following investigation there is no
                comeback for innocent people to right the wrongs done to them.
                The Minister mentioned that there is an obligation from a parity
                perspective. However, there is no rush to bring this legislation
                forward. The Minister said that delay here would delay the
                implementation of the equivalent Act in Britain, and if that is
                the case then they will go ahead in Britain. He also said that
                there would be a code of practice. A code of practice is no
                substitute for good legislation, and we have seen that many
                times in the past. I oppose the use of the accelerated passage
                procedure, and I hope that others will do likewise.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr B Hutchinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to raise the issue of accelerated
                passage. I understand what the Minister has said, and I agree
                with him on what needs to be done. My difficulty with this Bill
                and Standing Order 40(2) is that I am not sure that parity is
                mentioned. Either we decide that parity means accelerated
                passage or we do not. Such decisions must be made in all
                matters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My understanding is that if this Bill were to
                go through the Committee Stage, the House could be asked to
                carry it over to the next sitting in September in time for its
                commencement. I am informed by people at Westminster that the
                commencement date is not expected until spring 2002, yet the
                Minister told me that it is expected to start in autumn 2001. I
                accept that, but there seems to be a difference of opinion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are setting a very dangerous precedent.
                Not long ago Michelle Gildernew commented that she was against
                setting the precedent of accelerated passage in the Assembly. At
                the time I said nothing, because I felt that what had to be said
                had been said. I am, however, concerned that Ministers are being
                allowed to accelerate whatever they want through the House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On this occasion I am not as concerned as my
                Colleague, Mr Kelly, about what is in the Bill. No matter what
                we do, because of parity, the Minister cannot change what has
                been set down at Westminster. But how we allow Ministers and
                Departments to conduct business is a point of principle.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand that Westminster had six months
                with the Bill and that the Department for Social Development was
                told about it in January 2001. It did not, however, come before
                the House. Long before the Easter recess I asked the Chairperson
                and the Clerk of the Committee for Social Development if any
                legislation was to be dealt with between Easter and now, and
                nothing was forthcoming. Other Committee members know that the
                question was asked. My concern is therefore about how the
                Executive deal with business. They must deal with it better than
                they have so far, and they need to get that message.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The question for me is parity. Do we agree
                that parity deserves accelerated passage? The Committee or
                whoever is responsible for deciding should make that decision.
                It will be difficult for the Minister — whether it be Maurice
                Morrow or some other member of the DUP — because in fairness
                that Department will have most to do with parity in dealing with
                social security.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is not a question of the Minister’s
                ability or about the content of the Bill. I accept all that he
                has said today. My argument is about our setting precedents
                which enable other Ministers to use acceleration for other
                reasons. We need to make very sure that this is not an abuse of
                power.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We face the issue of liaison between the
                Department for Social Development and the Department of Social
                Security in London and, on a wider scale, between the Executive
                and the Cabinet. I have heard no argument from the Minister on
                why the Assembly should be forced into rushing an accelerated
                passage procedure on this Bill through because they failed to
                get their act together.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Billy Hutchinson said that the Department was
                aware of this Bill in January. The English Bill was going
                through its process in Parliament at Westminster in January and
                February. If that was so, I see no reason for producing a Bill
                on the Floor of the House today and saying that it must go
                through in the few weeks before the summer recess and that if it
                does not, that will be the fault of Members who wish to
                scrutinise legislation properly. Talk that a code of practice
                might somehow be the solution to bad legislation is so spurious
                as to be unacceptable. Perhaps the Minister could tell us
                whether he has a Northern Ireland code of practice or if he has
                merely adapted the GB code of practice, as has happened with the
                Bill itself.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We seem to be rehashing the arguments that we
                had about the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Bill.
                We have never discussed the fundamental principle of how far we
                are bound by every clause, comma and full stop of Westminster
                legislation if there is to be parity in social security
                provision. Whilst we may have parity in social security in the
                rates of benefits paid, it is quite clear that parity of
                taxation does not exist in the United Kingdom. There is no
                parity of effect in social security payments either; the costs
                that claimants incur vary widely, yet there is a blanket
                allocation of the payment in pounds sterling per week.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must start to discuss some of these
                issues, and not merely when a Minister decides that accelerated
                passage is needed for a certain matter. It was presumed that if
                we were to have a single social security system for the United
                Kingdom, that would have been a reserved matter. However, it is
                not. I am not aware that anyone in the House has argued that it
                should be. If it is not to be a reserved matter, the Assembly
                should give proper scrutiny to every aspect of its legislative
                programme. By proper scrutiny I mean no accelerated passage, and
                detailed scrutiny of every piece of legislation. If that results
                in a Minister’s having to try to negotiate with a Minister in
                London about the fine-tuning of a Bill as it goes through its
                Consideration Stage, so be it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As long as we have the legislative duty here,
                we should use it. We should not merely run away saying
                &quot;This is parity. Let’s do nothing&quot;.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Social Development
                Committee (Mr Cobain):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee for Social Development had a
                long discussion about the Bill, and it did not have any
                objections. The Minister attended those meetings and answered
                specific questions. Therefore I want to make it absolutely clear
                that there is no dispute about the Bill. Accelerated passage is
                a different matter altogether.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will face the issue of accelerated passage
                on a number of occasions because of the social security Bills
                and the relationship between this Assembly and Westminster. I am
                sure that the Minister will request accelerated passage on a
                number of important issues such as payments. I do not think that
                any Member will object to accelerated passage for payments,
                because people in Northern Ireland would be disadvantaged
                without it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me highlight a number of issues relating
                to the Bill. Mr Kelly wanted to know how the Bill will be
                implemented. The Minister explained to the Committee that
                objections and concerns about the implementation of the Bill
                should be raised when the code of practice — which Members can
                study today — comes before the House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee has a number of concerns about
                the implementation of the Bill. Clearly there are human rights
                implications. The handover of power to the Department allows it
                to investigate a range of personal issues such as individual
                bank accounts. In some cases the Department will be able to
                delve into the personal arrangements of innocent people. That
                concerns me deeply. However, that debate will begin with
                consideration of the code of practice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As far as possible, we should try to divorce
                these two issues. The Committee approves of the Bill. The issue
                of accelerated passage which has caused concern to a number of
                Members must be dealt with in a wider political forum. Parity is
                of enormous importance to claimants in the area of social
                security, and accelerated passage will not be stopped when it
                comes to paying claimants. The Minister responded as best he
                could to the Committee’s questions, and the majority of the
                Committee is satisfied with the Bill as it stands.</p>

                rights, which is something that I am particularly interested in
                and asked a direct question or two on, I received answers that
                are, I suppose, protected by this code of practice. I took the
                step of consulting a human rights legal expert, who assured me
                that on a preliminary reading of the proposed legislation he
                could not see where there would be an infringement of human
                rights. While a more definitive view could be sought on that
                matter, and I may reserve judgement on it, I was quite satisfied
                because I recognised his authority in that area. While the
                legislation does appear to be strong in some respects,
                unfortunately it may be necessary when we are dealing with this
                loophole.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two things have frustrated me for many years
                as a public representative fighting people’s social security
                benefit cases. One is the amount of money that goes unclaimed
                each year and that should be given to those who are entitled to
                it. The second is the amount that is lost through fraud. I do
                not think that anybody could possibly stand over that and allow
                it to happen. I am afraid that the interpretation that might be
                put on our refusal to accept this request for accelerated
                passage might be that we were standing over a recognised
                loophole and allowing it to continue. That concerns me, because
                it annoys me to think of the abuse as well as the unclaimed
                amounts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee did get a fair chance at that
                preliminary stage. We will have opportunities at the Second and
                further Stages to examine the matter even further. I hope that a
                more definitive legal opinion may be available to me by then. At
                the moment, I hope that Members will agree to accept the
                Minister’s recommendation.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue before this Assembly today is not
                one in regard to the content of this Bill. It is very important
                to keep that in mind. I myself am not a supporter of the
                acceleration procedures. There is a better way of doing business
                than that. On this issue we have to be absolutely honest, as was
                pointed out by Mr Cobain. He said that we will accelerate
                payments, but we are not prepared to accelerate legislation to
                stop fraud. Where do we stand in this Assembly?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill talked about his frustration when
                he has been representing people. I have had the same frustration
                when I have looked at the vast amount of money that is lost to
                the system through fraud. We must have a proper scrutiny of this
                today, because there is the code of conduct to be looked at, and
                there is another debate coming. People outside this House expect
                us, as the guardians of public money, to want to do something
                that should be done. After all, if we did not have devolution
                — and I happen to be a devolutionist — this provision would
                already be in force.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us take the pragmatic step of saying
                &quot;Yes, we might not agree with putting business before the
                House in this way, but we need this procedure when it comes to
                making social benefit payments. We need it now to safeguard the
                public purse so that the money can be made available and more of
                it kept for the purpose for which it was raised&quot;. That is
                the issue before us. If there was something radically wrong with
                the Bill, people here would not accept it, but as there is
                nothing wrong with it, as the Committee procedure has shown, the
                time has come for us to speed up the process and to deal with
                this running sore.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Morrow:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have listened carefully to all of the
                contributions. I would be bitterly disappointed if the Assembly
                were to decide that this is the time to take a stand on
                legislation and, in particular, parity legislation. It would be
                a tragedy if the Assembly, which was allegedly brought into
                being to speed legislation up and to bring Government nearer to
                the people, were to be the very instrument that held the process
                up. Several Members have voiced their concerns, and I in no way
                disparage those concerns. Some Members also recognised that we
                addressed all of the issues that were raised at the Committee as
                honestly and squarely as we could.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to deal with the issues that Members
                have raised today to see if I can further allay their fears and
                concerns. I hope that I can. Several Members mentioned the issue
                of human rights. The Bill does comply with human rights
                legislation. Mr ONeill has gone the second mile; he was
                concerned about this aspect, and he double- checked the facts.
                He has been satisfied, from another source, that the Bill
                complies with human rights legislation. Some Members raised the
                matter of the code of practice. The Committee raised this issue
                and put much emphasis upon it. The Committee was satisfied that
                the code of practice that we were introducing would go a long
                way towards ensuring that everything was done fairly and that
                every step that could be taken was being taken.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Billy Hutchinson, Rev Dr Ian Paisley and
                others had concerns about the accelerated passage. This is not
                an attempt to abuse procedure — this is purely an attempt to
                keep up with parity legislation. I can understand why Members
                would want to object to the use of accelerated passage for
                anything other than parity legislation. If I were sitting on the
                Back Benches I would feel the same way. This is not an attempt
                to ride roughshod over the elected representatives in the House
                — the aim is keep up with parity legislation. Mr Hutchinson
                also made the point that much of the legislation that comes from
                my Department is parity legislation. He is right. My Department,
                probably more than any of the other 10 Departments that are
                answerable to the Assembly, deals with parity legislation. It
                follows therefore that I will be on my feet more often to ask
                for accelerated passage, purely in an attempt to enable us to
                stay in step with Great Britain.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford also raised the issue of the code of
                practice. I have dealt with that, and I hope I have satisfied
                him as I think we did the Social Development Committee by the
                assurance that the code of practice is not something that has
                been cobbled together. It is a code of practice that the Social
                Development Committee is totally satisfied will meet the
                requirements.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is the Minister speaking about a Northern
                Ireland code of practice and not an adapted Great Britain code
                of practice?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Morrow:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By and large, it is a code of practice for
                the rest of Great Britain. I assure the Member that it will also
                be unique to Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Social Development
                Committee, Fred Cobain, has struck the right chord on all
                issues. He chaired the meetings that my officials and I
                attended, and he has made a very useful contribution. He has hit
                all the right buttons today, and he acknowledges the reason why
                we must opt for accelerated passage. I cannot gainsay or add to
                anything that he has said, and I thank him for his useful and
                positive contribution.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have dealt as best I can with Mr ONeill’s
                concerns. The Bill is compliant with the Human Rights Act, and
                he has already satisfied himself on that point.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford asked if it would not be possible to
                introduce this Bill before the Great Britain Bill receives Royal
                Assent. The answer is no. A more detailed answer is that, as
                with all social security Bills, amendments were tabled at every
                stage of its process through Parliament. Given the need for
                parity, it is better to introduce a Bill that reflects the Great
                Britain Act than to introduce a Bill at an early stage and ask
                the Assembly to work its way through corresponding amendments in
                order to achieve a corresponding Act. That would be an
                unnecessary use of the Assembly’s valuable time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Paisley said that in principle he is not
                an enthusiastic supporter of accelerated passage. Nevertheless,
                having been a parliamentarian for many years, he recognises the
                need for social security legislation to be kept on a par with
                the rest of the UK. That is a very valid point.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He also made the point that we in the
                Assembly are custodians of the public purse. Every year we lose
                approximately £73 million through fraud. Something has to be
                done about that, and today we are making an attempt to close the
                loopholes that fraudsters are jumping through.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Paisley and Éamonn ONeill made the point
                that they have felt frustrated in their roles as representatives
                of their constituencies. When this legislation is passed, some
                of their frustrations will not exist any more. We will have gone
                a long way towards ensuring that legislation exists to trap
                those who abuse the system. We want to get funding and give
                social security benefits to those who deserve and need them. We
                also want to deprive those who are jumping in and out through
                the legislation loopholes and who are keeping money back from
                those entitled to it. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was at Edenaveys industrial estate in Armagh
              some months ago, where the local economic development group had a
              sod-cutting ceremony. I am familiar with a number of the
              difficulties. The planning process for Newry is further advanced
              than that for Armagh city and district, as the Member will be
              aware. It has been the practice in recent years for IDB to focus
              its activities on main urban areas, whereas enterprise agencies,
              backed by LEDU and the International Fund for Ireland, focus more
              on the more outlying areas to which he refers. It is a question of
              balance, but I am satisfied at present that in that constituency
              there is adequate serviced land, although this will be
              continuously kept under review. I am also conscious that the
              Member has, on a number of occasions, pointed out to me his
              dissatisfaction with the degree of progress in Armagh city itself.
              IDB has taken these points on board.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My supplementary has nearly been answered. Will
              the Minister offer his ongoing commitment to provide cheap,

              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am familiar with Members’ frustration at
              the relatively slow progress in dealing with what is a matter that
              affects every consumer.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot think of any other issue on which I
              have had more traffic from Members, whether in the form of
              delegations or questions. As the Member will know, the subject has
              been debated in the Chamber, and the Enterprise, Trade and
              Investment Committee is currently undertaking an energy inquiry.
              Next week I am hoping to meet electricity representatives to
              review the report on the industry’s performance, particularly
              during the storms earlier this year.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, there have been positive developments.
              A new gas-fired — and infinitely more efficient — power
              station is being built at Ballylumford. The Scottish
              interconnector will, I hope, come into operation at the turn of
              the year, and we have a proposal for another gas- fired power
              station, which will be located at Coolkeeragh near Londonderry.
              All of these things, combined with the regulator’s review of
              transmission and distribution costs, should contribute to a
              reduction in costs and certainly greater efficiency in the energy
              system.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Making radical changes will mean dealing with
              the long-term contracts, and while we are actively pursuing the
              option of buying out those contracts, it is a very complicated and
              expensive process. I hope to be in a position to report to the
              House later in the year.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister agree that Northern Ireland
              consumers have very little to look forward to in terms of reduced
              prices until the long-term contracts are dealt with? Can he give
              us any further details of the position of those negotiations? This
              is the fundamental issue as regards the high cost of energy in
              Northern Ireland. Until those uncompetitive contracts are dealt
              with, the consumer cannot look forward with any real hope to the
              downward pressure on prices that is required.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member is probably right, but there are a
              number of things to be considered. It is a matter of trying to
              open more of the market to competition. The contracts include a
              specific fuel cost section, and therefore there is a direct
              linkage between international fuel costs and the price the
              customer pays. The more efficient the plant, the smaller that
              component part of the price is, because 80% of what the consumer
              pays is in generation costs. With brand new plants at Ballylumford
              and, it is to be hoped, Coolkeeragh, we will have state-of-the-art
              equipment in place which will be able to generate more elctricity
              per unit — or per therm of gas — than is currently the case.
              Additionally, we will have the interconnector.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member is correct in that a very bad deal
              was done in 1991, and we are paying the price for that. There is
              no point in trying to hide that from the House. I intend that all
              of these issues — the regulator’s review of transmission and
              distribution costs; the gas pipelines; the way we treat the
              contracts and a range of other matters — will be dealt with in
              the current calendar year. I intend that we will then be in a
              position to report to the House with a comprehensive package of
              what it is possible to do. I cannot be more specific than that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Treasury will have a role in deciding
              whether we can deal with the buyouts. That will mean bonds. Bonds
              have been used as a tool in some other utility buyouts in Great
              Britain. However, each case has to be dealt with on its merits. We
              are dealing with very large sums of money, and we have to be aware
              that we are taking major decisions. We will never get ourselves
              completely free from this until we deal with the contracts.</p>

              met trade union representatives from the factory and will meet the
              management. Can the Minister give details of the investment that
              the company received from the IDB? There are concerns that
              machinery in the factory has already been broken down and sold
              off. Has any public money been used to purchase that machinery,
              and, if so, will there be any clawback? What has been done with
              regard to jobs for people who have been laid off? It has been
              predicted that by the end of August all the employees will have
              lost their jobs and the factory will be closed. Go raibh maith

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am familiar with the concerns that the Member
              raises. Those matters have raised their heads on previous
              occasions. However, the hon Member will be aware that the company
              had to be summoned to appear before the Committee for Enterprise,
              Trade and Industry. Perhaps that gives an insight into some of the
              difficulties that we have in dealing with large corporations. They
              like to make decisions unfettered in any way, and the only reason
              that the summons could be issued was that the company had received
              public money. IDB, as it does in all cases, had to look at the
              letter of offer under which that public money was drawn down to
              see if its terms and conditions were implemented. I cannot be more
              precise. We are watching that type of thing closely.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I raise two other points. We wanted to achieve
              a successful outcome, and an alternative buyer has been sought,
              either a management buyout or another company. So far no offers
              have been received. However, under the circumstances, we are
              prepared to examine any proposals and treat them on their merits,
              irrespective of previously agreed arrangements with the existing
              owners and without the overhang from other offers. If we feel that
              the letter of offer has not been implemented as was agreed, the
              potential for clawback exists. However, that is a legal matter,
              and I cannot go into too much detail here.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Significant progress has been made on the
              implementation of the Kurt Salmon report. One of the
              recommendations was that a company should be established among the
              industry, something we are facilitating at present. An interim
              chief executive has been identified, and many of the legal
              technicalities have been completed. I look forward to the early
              launch of that company, which will help to promote the textiles
              industry.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to make it clear that we facilitate the
              industry to help itself. We will have to give considerable thought
              to how we target the selective financial assistance offered to
              companies. We want to give it to companies that bring forward
              proposals in line with the Kurt Salmon recommendations. The
              procedures have been followed in the current situation in Lurgan.
              As soon as we detect a threat to jobs, the Department of Higher
              and Further Education is notified, and a team assesses the
              situation individually with each worker who will be directly
              affected.</p>

              consistently lower than average levels of unemployment. The
              claimant count is currently running at 3·6%, which is in the
              bottom quartile for Northern Ireland. I am optimistic that if it
              is not possible to find an alternative buyer for the factory, then
              many of the people there will be able to be redeployed. There is a
              standard procedure for this, and my Colleague Dr Farren is
              directly involved in it. If the company cannot be replaced, I hope
              that as many people as possible will be relocated and retrained.</p>

              there is a huge need for urgent action on the part of Tourism

              development programme will deal with the crisis currently arising
              out of foot-and- mouth disease, but it appears that very little is
              being done to promote this region for tourism both internally and
              from GB over this summer. Surely as we can now hope that
              foot-and-mouth disease is being put behind us, it is incumbent
              upon Tourism Ireland Limited and the Minister’s Department to do
              more to actively promote tourism, particularly rural tourism,
              whether that requires overnight stays or day trips in Northern

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not accept that nothing is being done.
              Tourism Ireland Limited is not going to be effective in the
              marketplace until the tourism season in 2002. It has only just
              been established; it must get its staff together, and it must get
              agreed marketing material. McCann Erickson has been appointed to
              work on that. We have seen some preliminary sight of it, but it
              will not be effective in the marketplace until next year.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member will be aware that my Department has
              made £1 million available for a particular promotion in the short
              term to deal with the aftermath of foot-and- mouth disease. That
              is ongoing. It applies in all markets, both locally and
              internationally. Proportionately, that is two or three times more
              than is being spent in the rest of the United Kingdom. We will
              also have access to a small amount of national resource as a
              consequence of moneys that have been allocated by the Treasury to
              the British Tourist Authority — we will get a share of that.
              That share alone would not have been sufficient.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, with my Colleague the Minister for
              Culture, Arts and Leisure we have supported alternative locally
              based actions such as the North West Fest. If there are other
              applications coming forward we will look at those on their merits,
              but over the next few months we have a rolling programme of
              specific promotional events. I am sure that if the Member cares to
              look at the tourist web site, he will see that there is a very
              ambitious programme ongoing which we hope will contribute towards
              the minimisation of the losses in the industry over the coming

              offices as about the Republic of Ireland’s ability to hog the

              afoot to tackle the problem of tourists who day-trip in Northern
              Ireland yet base their holidays in the Republic of Ireland and
              subsequently leave their currency there?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not surprised to see the Member on his
              feet about these issues, given his particular interest in north
              County Antrim. The Member has put his finger on the problem, which
              is that 70% of the people who visit Northern Ireland from overseas
              come onto the island via the Republic. In recent years there has
              been a pattern of day-tripping, but with the overnight stays
              taking place in the Republic. The Member is absolutely right.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He may recall that, in the setting up of
              Tourism Ireland Limited, it was written into the agreement and
              understanding of 18 December 1998 that the company has to pay
              particular attention to the special circumstances of Northern
              Ireland over the last 30 years. That is written into what might be
              regarded as the deeds of the company. Any marketing that it does,
              now or in the future, must therefore take that into account. That
              particular phraseology is there to prevent precisely what the
              Member was talking about.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not simply a matter of Northern Ireland
              versus the Republic. It also applies to the north-western part of
              the Republic itself. You will find great dissatisfaction in places
              north-west of Sligo and into Donegal. The people there feel that
              they have not been getting their share of the tourist traffic. It
              is a question therefore of moving many of the visitors further up
              the island, and of developing our ability to bring international
              visitors directly into Northern Ireland via our own airports. That

              poorly served at present by international destinations. We
              currently have only a Brussels route and an Amsterdam route. We
              have no route to Paris and no flight to North America.
              Negotiations are ongoing to resolve both of those matters, but
              until that infrastructure is there, we are always going to be
              fighting a rearguard action. We are acutely aware that that is the
              real problem, and therefore we have to take steps to counteract
              it.</p>

              interest in Tourism Ireland and his unquestioned efforts to make
              it a success. Does the Minister understand the frustration that
              there is locally that this key project appears to be taking an
              unacceptable length of time to get up and running? Will he assure
              the Assembly that he is making every effort to fast-track the
              project, given that it is a key element in our future tourism?</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate the frustration, but we have asked
              some very high-calibre individuals to head this organisation.
              These are people who run chains of hotels and people who
              understand business.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For example, the deputy chairperson came from
              Microsoft. They are working as hard as they can. They have had
              four or five meetings, and I hope to meet them at the end of the
              month in the Member’s own district. It is my view that resources
              have been provided. They have had some difficulties with staffing
              and getting secondments from Bord Fáilte in the Republic, but
              that is an industrial relations issue. Through the Tourist Board
              we have supplied all the help that we can. They are working on the
              material for next year. That is the key thing, because you must
              have the marketing tool.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Andrew Coppel, who was born and bred in
              Belfast, is the chairperson, and he has a very clear understanding
              of the tourism issues. I am confident that when it starts to roll
              out for the next tourist season, the Member will feel satisfied
              that we have got matters right and that the market will grow in
              Northern Ireland.</p>

              not sure that we in the Foyle constituency can wait for this to be
              put into action, given that we have the highest long-term
              unemployment in the whole of the Six Counties. Fourteen of the
              most socially deprived wards are located in the Foyle
              constituency, and this is directly related to long-term
              unemployment. I ask the Minister to consider setting up a task
              force in the Foyle constituency to address this long-term
              unemployment. We talk about it, but no action is ever taken.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member needs to be reassured that I fully
              understand the situation in the Foyle constituency. As the Member
              will know, I have visited the area as frequently as I possibly
              can. I visit the city regularly. I know that my colleague Dr
              Farren, through his own Department, has been working very hard,
              and his Department and mine have been co-operating to devise the
              best measures that we can.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member will also be aware that the
              Programme for Government makes a series of major commitments.
              Long-term unemployment is still high in the Member’s
              constituency, but I think it ought to be noted that if you compare
              the situation today with that of five or ten years ago, there has
              been progress, albeit insufficient. Nobody can be complacent, but
              there has been progress.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Indeed, there have been a significant number of
              industrial developments in the Foyle constituency that we hope
              will provide the long-term foundations for a resolution of these
              issues. It is only possible when the opportunities are there. At
              the risk of taking some time on this answer, I will give the
              Member an example. When it was indicated that the Coolkeeragh
              power station might be rebuilt, we formed a group in the city, in
              conjunction with the Department of Finance and Personnel and
              others, to try to bring together businesses that could benefit
              from the £200 million that will be spent on the erection of the
              power station. We encouraged local businesses to be available to
              take advantage of the contracts when they came in.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is the sort of measure that we are trying
              to take, as well as those that are published in the Programme for
              Government. I believe that given enough time to work through this
              Programme for Government, we will see inroads being made into
              long-term unemployment in that area.</p>

              contribute to overcoming the high levels of deprivation and
              unemployment, as well as underpinning the policy of targeting
              social need and equality, would be to confirm when the investment
              in the new gas pipeline will take place, enabling Coolkeeragh to
              be built. When is the Minister likely to be in a position to make
              such a statement?</p>

              its American partner. They have made an offer, which is currently
              on the table. We have set up a negotiating team with the

              is carrying out an economic appraisal of its accommodation needs.
              I recently made a ministerial visit to the college and observed at
              first hand the condition of some parts of the estate. This is why
              the college is engaged with the Department in developing its plans
              for the future development of its accommodation needs. When the
              appraisal is clear, the needs will be considered in the light of

              avail of the high standard of the courses that we make available
              in our further and higher education institutions. Historically,
              there has been, and still is, a considerable flow of students from

              they do not get the benefit of such an external benchmarking of
              their research standards, would the Minister consider suggesting
              to his Dublin counterpart that something like the RAE be

              initiatives that are funded there. It is evident from the
              considerable flow of funding into the universities and research
              institutes in the South that their performance is judged highly.
              They have their internal systems in the universities for
              benchmarking research, and I am satisfied that their initiatives
              ensure high standards. The existence of co-operation, albeit that
              it might be greater in a number of disciplines, between our
              institutions and those in the South is testimony to the high
              regard that academics and researchers here have for the standards

              concerned with the universities’ responsibilities for careers
              guidance. I am aware from my own experience that both of our
              universities have highly developed careers advisory services.
              Those services ensure that students throughout, and particularly
              towards the end, of their courses are made fully aware of career
              prospects ahead of them, and of the professional programmes that
              they need to pursue to enter the careers of their choice.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The provision of careers guidance in further
              education colleges has come under the remit of the careers review
              that we have undertaken in conjunction with the Department of
              Education. My Department is currently examining the report from
              that review, and it is hoped that decisions will soon be made in
              the light of its recommendations.</p>

              courses will be available on a full-time basis, however, it will
              probably be less. Numbers in the colleges will not be huge, as we
              have 100&nbsp;full-time equivalents, but this is part of a pilot
              project which will begin its second year in September. There will
              then be a detailed ongoing review, which will evaluate the effects
              and benefits of the introduction of foundation degrees. That will
              help us to decide their future. We have to remember that
              foundation degrees are not the only form of higher education

              the windows might remain unplastered for three to four weeks,
              which is not acceptable. Will the Minister review this current

              standards. The executive generally does a very good job, but there
              are unacceptable exceptions. The competence of the work and the
              contractors on any scheme are closely monitored by the Housing
              Executive. As to the question of whether double glazing should be
              installed ad infinitum, it is difficult to say yes or no. Every

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Social Security Agency realises how
              important it is that everyone should claim and receive the proper
              benefit entitlement. The agency ensures that the public is aware
              of the range of benefits and other services that are available
              through a number of measures, including a comprehensive range of
              leaflets, promotion in the media and a benefits enquiry line for
              people with disabilities, and by working closely with a number of
              voluntary sector organisations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Publicity campaigns to signal the arrival of
              new benefits and to increase awareness of existing ones are
              regularly undertaken. Some recent measures are: the launch of the
              agency’s customer charter pack, which includes a guide to all
              benefits and details of agency locations; the minimum income
              guarantee campaign, which has given pensioners in Northern Ireland
              an extra £100,000 per week; the foot-and-mouth disease financial
              help leaflet, targeted at those most affected by the crisis; and
              the recently launched guide to public services for pensioners in
              Northern Ireland.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for his reply. However, I
              understand that about £6 million went unclaimed in 2000.
              Therefore the various measures that the Minister listed are not
              working. Does the Minister agree that we really need better
              education for those people who meet the general public? They
              should be better educated in more than one benefit. They should
              change their mindset to such a degree that claimants who come to
              benefit offices are not seen as a nuisance. Claimants should be
              given full help, education and assistance in filling in the
              plethora of forms, and pointed in the right direction. They must
              be recognised as being the most deprived and vulnerable in our
              society, rather than often being dismissed and told to go to the
              Citizens Advice Bureau.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In general, I agree with Mr Close. However, I
              will outline several things that my Department is either doing or
              has done. The qualifying conditions for social security benefit
              are contained in the leaflet ‘Your Guide to Our Services’.
              That leaflet is incorporated in the Social Security Agency’s
              customer charter pack. It is also available separately at all
              social security offices and at the benefit shop in Castle Street.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The leaflet is a signpost document that tells
              customers the following: who can get the benefit; how to claim;
              rates of benefit payable; what other help is available; and where
              more information can be obtained. Other leaflets and claim packs
              are available from social security offices.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept that this information should be as
              widely available as possible. We have run publicity campaigns,
              which have had some success. The recent minimum income guarantee
              publicity campaign has resulted in just over 7,000 pensioners
              claiming the minimum income guarantee since the campaign was
              launched in March last year. Of these, just over 4,000 have been
              successful. That resulted in the average extra payment of
              £100,000 a week in the hands of pensioners in Northern Ireland.
              We are getting there, and these figures are sure signs of
              increased public awareness of what help is available.</p>

              of £23 a week each, which comes to a total of £100,000 extra a
              week for pensioners. With regard to long-term strategy, the Social
              Security Agency will be developing a strategy for maximising the
              uptake of all benefits as part of its targeting social need (TSN)
              initiative. That will follow on from the introduction of the
              family resources survey in Northern Ireland, the results of which
              will, I hope, be available by autumn 2003.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the beginning of May 2001, a total of
              130,935 tenants were receiving housing benefit. Of those, 90,677
              were from the public sector and 40,258 were from the private
              sector. The average length of time taken to process a housing
              benefit claim is 13 days in the public sector and 23 days in the
              private sector. Those figures compare favourably with similarly
              sized local authorities that administer housing benefit in Great
              Britain. Housing benefit is an important part of the social

              out a mortgage before 2 October 1995, certain vulnerable people
              who are subject to a shorter waiting period, and people aged 60
              and over, whose interest is paid from the start of the claim.

              expect that people in employment who take out a mortgage should
              make some provision against difficult times such as short periods
              of unemployment between jobs. Many will have savings or final
              payments from their employment that will help cover part, if not
              all, of the mortgage payments during this initial period. I want
              to re-emphasise that the fresh claims are coming mostly from
              people who have been working.</p>

              3(a) and 3(b) of Table 1.3 in the volume of the Northern Ireland
              Estimates 2001-02 that was laid before the Assembly on 11 June
              2001.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I propose the adoption of the resolution under
              section 63 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, which provides for
              the Minister of Finance and Personnel to make to the Assembly
              proposals leading to cash appropriations from the Consolidated
              Fund. In doing so, I act on behalf of the Executive, and the
              spending allocations reflect the decisions of the Executive.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main spending plans were approved by the
              Assembly during the Budget debate on 18 December 2000. There was,
              therefore, a period of scrutiny of the proposals between the
              presentation of the draft Budget on 17 October and the Budget
              debate on 18 December. Since then my Department and I have sought
              to provide all the briefing and analysis needed in regard to the
              proposals. We have also sought to develop procedures for the
              future, which will improve the scope and detail of the
              consultative process.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Budget, as approved on 18 December, has
              been supplemented by further resources carried forward from
              2000-01, and by the first allocations from the Executive programme
              funds, as I explained in my statements of 12 February and 2 April.
              The main purpose of today’s motion is to seek the Assembly’s
              approval of the use of resources by the Northern Ireland
              Departments, the Northern Ireland Assembly, the Northern Ireland
              Audit Office, the Assembly Ombudsman for Northern Ireland and the
              Northern Ireland Commissioner for Complaints, and the Office for
              the Regulation of Electricity and Gas, for the year ending 31
              March 2002. This was summarised in the Estimates booklet that was
              laid before the Assembly on 11 June.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The resolution also seeks the Assembly’s
              approval of the allocation of a cash sum from the Consolidated
              Fund for the 2001-02 financial year, as detailed in the Estimates
              booklet. To ensure that the Assembly, and especially the Committee
              for Finance and Personnel, had the best possible opportunity to
              consider the Estimates, drafts were provided a month ago, before
              the printing process was finalised. We also offered briefing on
              the significance of the change from cash-based estimates to
              resource- based estimates, which takes effect this year. That
              offer still stands, and officials from my Department will provide
              further briefing on those issues for Members in the autumn.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amounts of cash and resources covered by
              today’s resolution are additional to the Vote on Account
              approved by the Assembly in the Supply resolution debate on 19
              February, which was followed by the passage of the Budget Bill.
              When the amounts quoted in today’s Supply resolution are added
              to the Vote on Account, the total cash and resources contained in
              the 2001-02 Main Estimates will amount to some £8,486 million and
              £9,327 million respectively.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remind the Assembly of the significance of
              the Supply resolution for which I seek support today. The
              resolution is the basis upon which the Assembly authorises the
              expenditure of Departments, the Assembly, the Northern Ireland
              Audit Office and other bodies in carrying out their functions. One
              of the Assembly’s most fundamental responsibilities is to
              authorise expenditure while holding Departments accountable for
              the use of this money. This is one of our main means of ensuring
              that we deliver on the commitments set out in the Programme for
              Government.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The scope of the debate covers expenditure in
              2001-02. The resolution is the means by which Estimates can be
              examined by the Assembly, thereby implementing the Budget agreed
              by the Executive and approved by the Assembly last December.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It will pave the way for us to consider the
              Budget (No 2) Bill, which, subject to the approval of the
              Assembly, will provide the legal authority for Departments to
              incur expenditure this year. As such, those steps represent the
              conclusion of the 2001-02 financial cycle. It is important that a
              clear distinction be drawn between those processes which are
              concerned with the current year and the preparatory steps that we
              are taking towards the development of a Budget for 2002-03, on
              which I will make a statement to the Assembly tomorrow.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before I cover the details of the Estimates, I
              want to acknowledge the confirmation by the Finance and Personnel
              Committee that appropriate consultation on the spending plans is
              reflected in these resolutions. I welcome the Committee’s keen
              and constructive interest in finance issues, and I look forward to
              further advice and assistance from Committee members throughout
              the key phases of our financial cycle.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Members will be aware, 2001-02 is the first
              year in which Budget allocations and Estimates will be determined
              and managed on a resource, rather than a cash, basis. The
              technical side of that transition does not need to take up time
              today. However, it is important that I draw out some important
              aspects of the Estimates that differ from the position on the
              Budget. The Budget as approved in December 2000 concentrated on
              expenditure in the departmental expenditure limit (DEL). The
              Estimates include some annually managed expenditure (AME) as well
              as expenditure that falls within the DEL. The main items that fall
              into that category are social security benefits, some of which are
              subject to annual appropriation or authorisation, and others which
              are charged under legislation to the National Insurance fund.
              Hence they do not feature in the voting process. Expenditure under
              the common agricultural policy also falls into the same category,
              because it is fully funded by the European agricultural guarantee
              and guidance fund.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As well as those AME items, there are some
              aspects of expenditure which were nominally attached to the
              departmental expenditure limit but which are ring-fenced by the
              Treasury. As we have no discretion on the use of those resources,
              they have also not been included in the context of our monitoring
              rounds, even though they were shown in the Budget documents in
              October and December last year. Those include expenditure under
              the Peace I programme and the special addition that was provided
              some years ago to cover the costs of the Moyle electricity
              interconnector.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have already mentioned that some expenditure
              on social security is handled outside the voting system, because
              there are standing authorisations in the form of specific
              legislation that allow money to be drawn from the Consolidated
              Fund or another fund to provide a service. A further example
              arises when a Department makes a loan under a statutory power. In
              most cases the issue of the loan will count towards the
              departmental expenditure limit. However, where there is a standing
              authorisation for the making of loans outside the vote, the loan
              would not need specific Assembly approval through the Estimates
              and Budget Bill system. Some important aspects of the Budget are
              funded in this way, as distinct from the supply procedure that we
              are considering today.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The total that determines what we can do is the
              departmental expenditure limit set by the Treasury. The Budget
              brings together all the expenditure and revenue that relate to
              what we can do within that limit to finance public services. The
              Estimates then set out what that means for the drawing of cash by
              Departments from the Consolidated Fund and their use of resources
              in relation to their objectives. I must also emphasise that the
              convention is that Estimates are not reduced as the year
              progresses, even if the Department concerned is clear that not all
              the spending will be required.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By their nature, the figures are estimates. The
              reason for the Supply resolution is that the Executive and the
              Departments are seeking authorisation for spending up to the
              figures quoted in the Estimates. This point is important, because
              it helps to explain how the figures, which were set out in the
              Budget planning documents, are ultimately reflected in the amounts
              that need to be authorised for issue from the Consolidated Fund to
              cover the approved expenditure. This is complex, but essential, in
              order to meet the twin requirements that we keep expenditure
              within the departmental expenditure limit as set by the Treasury,
              and seek authorisation for no greater amount of cash expenditure
              than is set out in the Estimates.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The total net resource requirement for the
              Department of Agriculture and Rural Development is
              £223&nbsp;million. Approximately £172&nbsp;million is sought in
              request for resources A. That sum provides for ongoing regional
              services and support measures, including £73&nbsp;million for
              development of agriculture and agricultural products industries
              and for scientific and veterinary services. Approximately
              £57&nbsp;million, including £2·4&nbsp;million allocated under
              Executive programme funds, is sought for farm support, enhancement
              of the countryside, animal disease compensation, and processing
              and marketing grants, which are totally funded by the European
              Union. Twelve&nbsp;million pounds is for central administration,
              including information technology and specialist accommodation
              services, and £9&nbsp;million is for the rural development
              programme.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nine&nbsp;million pounds is in respect of the
              EU peace and reconciliation programme and structural funds,
              totally funded by the EU, and £12&nbsp;million is for non-cash
              items such as notional interdepartmental charges, capital charges
              and depreciation costs. The various market support measures
              administered under the common agricultural policy, totalling
              £158&nbsp;million, are also accounted for under request for
              resources A. These are fully funded by the receipt from the EU
              and, therefore, cancel within the Estimate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Resources of £51&nbsp;million are sought in
              request for resources B. This includes £25&nbsp;million for the
              Rivers Agency, Forest Service and Fisheries Division, and £5
              million in relation to central administration, the EU peace and
              reconciliation programme and the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish
              Lights Commission. The remaining £21 million is in respect of
              non-cash items, such as notional interdepartmental charges,
              capital charges, and depreciation costs.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the resource requirement is adjusted to a
              cash basis and capital expenditure is taken into account, the
              Department is seeking £208&nbsp;million to fund expenditure on
              the Estimate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The total net resource requirement for the
              Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure is £76&nbsp;million, an
              increase of 3% on last year’s final net provision. Those
              resources, which are contained in a single request for resources,
              include £24&nbsp;million on expenditure by education and library
              boards on public libraries, of which £2·3&nbsp;million is for
              capital works and £0·3&nbsp;million has been allocated under the
              Executive programme funds. In addition, £9·9&nbsp;million has
              been provided for the National Museums and Galleries of Northern
              Ireland. The sum of £8·8&nbsp;million, including
              £0·7&nbsp;million allocated under the Executive programme funds,
              has been allocated for the Arts Council of Northern Ireland and
              other miscellaneous support for the arts, and £1·5&nbsp;million
              has been allocated for the Odyssey landmark project.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Approximately £4·8 million, of which £0·5
              million has been allocated under the Executive programme funds, is
              for the Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland, and £2·2 million is
              for the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.15 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The sum of £3·4 million is sought for sports.
              The request for resources also provides £1·6 million for the
              Northern Ireland Events Company and £0·8 million for the Armagh
              Planetarium and Observatory. Provision of £3·5 million is needed
              for Northern Ireland’s contribution to the North/South language
              body, and £2·6 million for Northern Ireland’s contribution to
              the Waterways Ireland project is also included. When the resource
              requirement is adjusted to a cash basis and capital expenditure is
              taken into account, it can be seen that the Department is seeking
              cash of some £74 million to fund expenditure on the Estimate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moving to the Department of Education,
              resources of some £1,350 million are sought in request for
              resources. Schools require £1,023 million for recurrent
              expenditure by education and library boards and £38 million for
              boards’ capital projects. The figure also provides for £59
              million for capital projects in voluntary and grant- maintained,
              integrated schools, £148 million for recurrent expenditure in
              voluntary grammar schools and £34 million for recurrent
              expenditure in grant-maintained, integrated schools. Some £5
              million is being made available under Executive programme funds
              and £7 million under the European Union’s peace and
              reconciliation programme.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For resources to cover youth service and
              community relations programmes for young people, resources of £27
              million are being sought. This includes some £18 million for
              recurrent and capital expenditure by education and library boards,
              £2 million under the Executive programme funds and £2 million
              under the European Union’s peace and reconciliation programme.
              When the resource requirement is adjusted to a cash basis and
              departmental capital expenditure is taken into account, the
              Department is seeking cash of some £1,377 million to fund
              expenditure on the Estimate. In the Estimate for teachers’
              superannuation, resources of £80 million are being sought along
              with a corresponding cash requirement of the same amount.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the Department of Enterprise, Trade and
              Investment the total net resource requirement is £322 million.
              The sum of £306 million is sought, first, to cover the Department’s
              economic support and regeneration measures. This includes £123
              million to help the Industrial Development Board to attract and
              support industrial development in Northern Ireland and £28
              million for local enterprise to assist in developing,
              strengthening and improving the competitiveness of the important
              small firms’ sector. Also included in this request for resources
              are £23 million to support the tourist industry and £26 million
              to increase industrially relevant research and technology in
              industry.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this request for resources, which covers the
              Department’s regulatory services, the sum of £16 million is
              sought. When the resource requirement is adjusted to a cash basis,
              and capital expenditure taken into account, the Department is
              seeking £306 million to fund expenditure on the Estimate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Turning now to the Department of the
              Environment, a total net requirement of some £112·8 million is
              being sought, together with £2·5 million for capital investment.
              This is a significant increase over the resources available last
              year, reflecting the need to resolve historical underfunding of
              the Department’s functions. Around £9 million of the new funds
              will be used to help meet international environmental obligations,
              including the development of a new strategy for the disposal of
              waste.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The remainder of the increase, some £3
              million, will be directed in a variety of ways, including
              assistance to district councils, the continuing effort to reduce
              road casualties and support for the planning process. When the
              resource requirement is adjusted to a cash basis and capital
              expenditure is taken into account, the Department is seeking
              almost £103 million to fund expenditure on the Estimate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department for Regional Development’s
              Estimate comprises two requests for resources with a total net
              requirement of £1,384 million, together with £173 million to
              meet direct departmental investment in capital projects. Requests
              for resources to cover the roads, transport and strategic planning
              functions of the Department with related central administration
              amount to just under £915 million, of which almost £692 million
              is attributable to non-cash costs such as depreciation and capital
              charges, substantially in respect of the road network.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Provision is also made for capital expenditure
              of some £63 million, mainly by the Roads Service, and this
              includes an initial allocation of approximately £2 million from
              Executive programme funds to enable four priority road schemes to
              progress.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the transport side, the request for
              resources includes the additional £20 million approved in the
              Budget to fund capital expenditure by the Northern Ireland
              Transport Holding Company to bring the railway network up to
              modern safety standards. This is included in the grants column on
              the resource side of the estimate. Almost £14 million is needed
              for other railway services and some £20 million for road
              passenger services, including concessionary fares.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Requests for other resources relate to the
              provision of water and sewerage services, for which a total net
              amount of slightly over £469 million is required. This includes
              some £5·5 million made available in the Budget approved by the
              Assembly in December 2000 to meet the additional cost associated
              with the Kinnegar waste water treatment works and alternative
              means of sludge disposal. Depreciation and capital charges
              amounting to £367 million are also catered for.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The £110 million needed for capital investment
              in the water supply and sewage treatment and disposal
              infrastructure includes the extra £14·5 million allocated in the
              Budget and £1 million for flood prevention work allocated from
              the Executive programme funds. After accruals to cash adjustments
              are made, the Department for Regional Development’s net cash
              requirement for the year is just over £509 million.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Turning to the Department of Higher and Further
              Education, Training and Employment, the total net resource
              requirement is £604 million. Some £396 million is being sought,
              which includes over £147 million for colleges of further
              education, £167 million for universities and colleges of
              education, and net resources of £81 million and capital provision
              of £95 million for student support, including provision for new
              arrangements emerging from the recent review of student support.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some £208 million is sought, which includes
              £42 million to provide 15,000 places in a range of employment and
              training measures, mainly within the New Deal initiative, for 18
              to 24-year-olds and the long-term unemployed. This will also
              provide for the introduction of an enhanced New Deal for the
              over-25s from April. Over £66 million is to provide over 12,000
              places under the Jobskills training programme, and a further £14
              million will be spent on other training and temporary employment
              programmes providing some 3,000 places for long-term unemployed
              adults who are not eligible for the New Deal.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the resource requirement is adjusted to a
              cash basis and departmental capital expenditure is taken into
              account, the Department is seeking £662 million cash to fund the
              expenditure in the Estimate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over £2,060 million is sought for the
              Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety. That
              figure includes £1,968 million to be spent on delivering an
              effective, high-quality health and social care service to people
              in need, £57 million for fire services and £34 million for
              departmental administration. When adjusted for capital payments
              and non-cash items, the net cash requirement is just over £2,124
              million. The Department of Health, Social Services and Public
              Safety’s Main Estimate identifies £48·6 million to meet the
              cost of the health and personal social services superannuation
              scheme. The net cash requirement for that estimate is also £48·6
              million.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department for Social Development has
              sought £2,473 million for resources A, which covers the
              Department’s social security and child support programme. That
              figure is made up of non-contributory and income- related benefit
              expenditure of £2,303 million, £145 million for administration
              and £25 million for non-cash items such as notional
              interdepartmental charges, capital charges and depreciation costs.
              Included in the administration cost is £18 million to enable the
              Department to take forward the welfare reform and modernisation
              programme.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department for Social Development is
              seeking £266 million for resources B, which covers the housing
              programme. That figure includes programme expenditure of £260
              million, administration costs of £2 million and £4 million for
              non-cash items. When net borrowing and the Housing Executive’s
              rent and capital receipts from house sales are taken into account,
              the gross resources available for housing will be over £600
              million.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In its request for resources C, which covers
              the urban regeneration and community development programme, the
              Department for Social Development is seeking £73 million. That
              figure includes programme expenditure of £57 million,
              administration costs of £6 million and £10 million for non-cash
              items. In programme expenditure, £30 million will be provided to
              promote and implement a comprehensive approach to physical and
              social regeneration, and £8 million will be provided for grants
              to voluntary bodies. Under the European Union peace and
              reconciliation programme, £16 million will be made available, of
              which £12 million will be funded from European Union receipts.
              When the resource requirement is adjusted to a cash figure and
              capital expenditure is taken into account, the Department for
              Social Development is seeking £2,773 million to fund the
              expenditure in the Estimate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Finance and Personnel has
              sought a total net resource of £133 million. For resources A, the
              Department has sought £23·4 million to maximise the benefit to
              Northern Ireland of public expenditure, including European Union
              funding. For resources B, the Department has sought £93·7
              million to support public sector business performance. For
              resources C, the Department has sought £16·4 million to
              administer specialised public services including Ulster Savings
              Branch, General Register Office, maintenance of the valuation list
              for rating purposes, Rate Collection Agency, Office of Law Reform,
              Land Registry and Lands Tribunal for Northern Ireland. When
              adjusted for capital and non-cash items, the net cash requirement
              is £124·6 million.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On superannuation, the Department of Finance
              and Personnel is seeking £18·5 million to cover the payment of
              pensions and lump sum benefits to those covered by the Principal
              Civil Service Pension Scheme. The net cash requirement for this
              Estimate is £18·4 million.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the Office of the First Minister and the
              Deputy First Minister, total resources of some £32 million are
              sought. Some £13·1 million is to support the Executive in making
              and implementing well-informed and timely policy decisions and
              improving public services, while £18·7 million is to promote
              equality of opportunity, human rights and improved community
              relations and to meet the needs of victims. When adjusted for
              capital and non-cash items, the net cash requirement is £32
              million.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Northern Ireland Assembly is seeking
              £37·7 million to cover Members’ salaries and expenses and the
              Assembly Secretariat. The net cash requirement for this Estimate
              is £38·8 million.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remind the Assembly that the spending plans
              that we are debating today derive from the first Budget cycle for
              which the devolved institutions have been solely responsible. We
              have collectively risen to the challenge of looking afresh at what
              our priorities should be, and at the social and economic outcomes
              that we wish to achieve through public expenditure.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Through the Programme for Government we have
              established a number of important priorities upon which we will
              wish to build our policies and develop our thinking further. These
              include meeting our equality obligations and giving proper
              recognition to need through targeting social need and the priority
              areas and initiatives that will attract additional funding through
              the Executive programme funds.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In commending this Supply resolution to the
              Assembly, it is right that we should reflect on the importance of
              being able to make these decisions in a devolved Assembly for a
              complete financial year for the first time. It is also appropriate
              that we ensure proper levels of management and control over the
              use of these resources so that they give maximum effect and
              deliver the highest quality and the greatest range of services
              possible for the citizens of Northern Ireland. I beg to move.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Finance and Personnel
              Committee (Mr Molloy):</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I
              thank the Minister for his detailed account of the Supply
              resolution and for the opportunity to contribute to this debate as
              Chairperson of the Finance and Personnel Committee.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Due to the suspension of the Assembly last
              year, the Committees had little time to consider the Main
              Estimates on the Supply resolution. This year there was disruption
              because of the Westminster and local government elections. There
              has, however, been limited time for the Committees to scrutinise
              their departmental spending plans.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Finance and Personnel Committee questioned
              the Department’s officials on three occasions on the Main
              Estimates, as proof copies became available. The Minister has
              today given a detailed account of the Supply resolution. The
              Committee welcomed the Minister’s proposal that the Committees
              should have the opportunity to scrutinise and focus on the Supply
              resolution to ensure that they were content that it reflects the
              needs of their respective Departments in the Programme for
              Government. The Committee advised the Minister of its preference
              to present the Executive funds as a separate functional line
              within the request for resources, as this is the case for
              expenditure such as the European Peace programme.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the Finance and Personnel Committee
              has expressed concern at the complete absence of prior
              consultation with the Assembly Committees regarding how to
              allocate the funds that become available through the monitoring
              rounds. These allocations are simply presented to the Assembly as
              a fait accompli, with no opportunity for the Statutory Committees
              to bring any influence to bear on how they are spent.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I suggest that the way in which in-year
              monitoring is handled should be re-examined. The procedures that
              were adopted during the direct rule era have continued on and
              carried across without serious consideration having been given as
              to whether they are appropriate in new circumstances. In the
              Committee’s opinion these procedures are far from being
              appropriate. A revised arrangement is needed in which the
              Department of Finance and Personnel anticipates the likelihood of
              additional resources becoming available as a result of the in-year
              monitoring. The Assembly Committees could be given advance
              information about the scale of the funds and their availability
              for reallocation, and their views could be sought in relation to
              how these funds could be reallocated, before the Executive
              Committee takes its final decision.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I speak for all departmental Committees when I
              say that the Committees must be fully consulted on future spending
              plans, including related financial matters such as the spending
              review, the regional rate, and the European Union structural
              funds. This should be undertaken early in the year to ensure that
              the Committees can make an effective contribution.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committees can demand this within the
              existing structures. Each Committee has the right to question its
              Department on what bids it is making and how it proposes to spend
              the money. Additionally, there is a duty on each Department to
              ensure that its respective departmental Committee has the
              information it needs to perform its statutory role of
              scrutinising, considering and advising on the departmental
              Estimates.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I refer to one of the principal points raised
              in the Committee for Finance and Personnel’s report with regard
              to the Budget proposals in November. The Committee suggested that
              steps needed to be taken to reassess the application of the
              Barnett formula with particular reference to its inability to
              address the present infrastructure deficit, the low population
              density across most of our region and, significantly, social need
              and deprivation. We suggested that the Minister look again at a
              joint approach with our counterparts in Scotland and Wales. With
              the involvement of the Committees a co-ordinated approach could be
              made to the Treasury.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to impress upon the Minister the
              overriding need to agree procedures for the handling of the annual
              financial cycle. The Committee for Finance and Personnel is
              extremely concerned about the Minister’s proposal for the
              handling of the early stages of the public service financial
              cycle.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is clear in the Belfast Agreement and
              reiterated in the Northern Ireland Act 1998 that the Committees
              have a statutory duty to advise Ministers in the formulation of
              policy. The role of the Committees in relation to the preparation
              of budgets is a central theme in their work. However, in this area
              it appears that the Executive Committee and the Department of
              Finance and Personnel are paying lip service to the functions of
              the Committees. It is clear that the various Departments have been
              told not to discuss their bids and proposals for the 2002-03
              financial year with Committees until tomorrow’s announcement by
              the Minister of Finance and Personnel. This effectively prevents
              Committees from becoming involved with their Departments’
              crucial stage of development of financial policy. The involvement
              of Committees in early consultation is crucial in planning ahead.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In virtually all other areas my Committee
              Colleagues are content with the procedures proposed by the
              Minister of Finance and Personnel. We still question the issue of
              early consultation. The success of future procedures depends on
              the ability of Committees to become involved in the early
              formulation of financial policy by individual Departments. To my
              knowledge there has been no coherent argument put forward to
              justify the withdrawal of rights of Committees to obtain policy
              papers relating to the bidding process, to be consulted and to
              have their views taken into account.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This situation is unacceptable to me and to the
              Committee, as it is to other Committee Chairpersons and members. I
              ask the Minister to look at this again. With this proviso in mind,
              I am content to recommend the Minister’s Supply resolution to
              the Assembly.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for
              Agriculture and Rural Development (Rev Dr Ian Paisley):</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Committee met on Friday 15 June and agreed
              that I should speak on its behalf in this debate. This Supply
              resolution allows consideration of the 2001-02 Main Estimates.
              Committee members received papers, including proof copies of these
              Estimates, in mid-May. At a meeting on 18 May Committee members
              agreed that their main interests in exercising their statutory
              powers regarding budgets lay in budget bids and allocations
              specifically related to the Department, rather than in the overall
              format and presentation of Estimates and general financial
              procedures. They therefore passed no comment on the proof copies
              of the Main Estimates. On Friday, however, members compared the
              final estimates with the plans previously tabled in the Programme
              for Government and the announcements regarding Executive programme
              funds.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members were reassured by the Department’s
              explanation of the differences in the figures, due mainly to the
              change from cash to resource terms. The Committee noted the
              inclusion in the Estimates of £2·4 million for Executive
              programme funds in this year, and it was content that this
              reflected announcements made by the Minister of Finance and
              Personnel.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Through the Executive programme funds the
              Department of Agriculture and Rural Development has secured
              important resources additional to those agreed in the original
              Budget. At that time the Committee supported the Department of
              Agriculture and Rural Development’s unsuccessful bids under farm
              waste management, nutrient management and organic farming.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee, having considered the draft
              LEADER programme last October, also welcomed the additional
              funding for the LEADER+ programme. However, when considering the
              Department’s Executive programme funds bids, the Committee noted
              that here had been no bid for funds to implement early retirement
              or new entrants schemes for farmers. These are imperative for the
              future of farming and for farming to remain the main job provider
              in Northern Ireland. It has long been the Committee’s view that
              such schemes are needed urgently. The foot-and-mouth disease
              crisis has simply brought this home, and we will be looking for
              action on this front — not pleasant words or promises on the
              dark horizon, but real action for the farming community in this
              year’s and next year’s budgets.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bad news for the fishing industry seems to be
              coming from Europe. Our fishing industry has already been
              decimated. There is an urgent need to deal with the
              decommissioning of boats in a realistic way. Why should fishermen,
              who have been given money to keep their boats in seaworthy
              condition to face bad weather conditions, be invited to pay back
              what they have received before they get any compensation
              whatsoever? That is an insult to the fishing industry.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While the Committee welcomes the increased
              funding for the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development
              for 2001-02, members agree that there should be no illusion in the
              Assembly, as quoted in the Ulster press, that the farmers are the
              big winners in this Budget. That is not a fact.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Farmers will need significant additional help,
              and, if we are realistic about keeping our farming industry, this
              year’s resource allocation can be seen only as a beginning.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for Higher and
              Further Education, Training and Employment (Dr Birnie):</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will start in my capacity as Chairperson, and
              then speak on behalf of my party.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note that in the Estimates relating to the
              Department of Further and Higher Education, Training and
              Employment, the allocation for central administration appears to
              have increased considerably this year in comparison to the
              previous year, from £27 million to £37 million. The
              justification for that cannot simply be the cost of introducing
              the new Department, as such changes would have already fed through
              the system. I wonder whether this is the result of reallocations
              under different definitions, or if it is a real change in
              administrative costs. That might be a cause for legitimate
              concern, both for the Committee and others.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to make two other points on the
              estimates allocated to the Department of Further and Higher
              Education, Training and Employment. These remarks will be based on
              a report published last week by the Organisation for Economic
              Co-operation and Development (OECD). The report, ‘Education at a
              Glance’, provided statistics for all OECD members — basically,
              the Western economies — and made two points that are relevant to
              the situation in Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, of all OECD members, the UK has the
              largest number of 21-year-olds graduating from university.
              Northern Ireland has a considerably higher so-called participation
              rate amongst its young people than the UK average. That is a cause
              for some satisfaction. However, the Minister will not be surprised
              that I will not say that everything is fine. There are some
              worrying issues that continue to require attention, and hence
              there are implications for the allocation of money to our
              universities and other parts of the Department.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a question mark over whether that high
              level of participation in Northern Ireland has been compatible
              with the maintenance of quality standards. Certainly, as in the
              rest of the UK, the cost per unit of output in higher education
              has been squeezed over the last 10 or 15 years, and there is a
              resultant strain — sometimes a considerable strain — on staff
              and students.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moreover, although Northern Ireland has a
              considerable proportion of 18-to-21-year-olds in higher education,
              around one quarter cannot stay here because there are insufficient
              places. While there has been some improvement in that regard, the
              need for increased numbers of places will have funding
              implications for the future.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, I want to address the area of adult
              basic skills.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The OECD report also showed that while the
              United Kingdom has a very good record of producing a high number
              of university graduates relative to the younger population, it
              also has the infamous position of being near the bottom of the
              OECD league with respect to the proportion of the working-age
              population who do not have basic numeracy or literacy skills. In
              this regard, Northern Ireland is no different from the United
              Kingdom average.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On behalf of the Higher and Further Education,
              Training and Employment Committee I welcome the funds that have
              been allocated to deal with this problem. I also welcome the
              Executive programme fund moneys, but I put down a marker to say
              that those funds are probably inadequate, given the scale of the
              ongoing problem. It is a major social and economic issue that must
              be tackled.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will now make some more general remarks. The
              motion concerns the fate of up to £5&nbsp;billion, which is a
              considerable sum of money. As the Minister said in his opening
              remarks, it is a demonstration that we have, thankfully, moved
              away from the direct rule system, wherein such moneys would have
              been dealt with in an entirely different manner.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No one of any sense ever argued that the
              introduction of devolution per se and the introduction of these
              new arrangements to deal with the authorisation and accountability
              of public money would immediately and necessarily lead to Northern
              Ireland’s becoming a land flowing with milk and honey. However,
              what can be reasonably argued is that we now have a process where
              the quality of decision-making is improved relative to what
              happened under direct rule. That improvement, while subtle, will,
              in the long run, create an economic and, ultimately, financial
              benefit which will exceed the considerable costs of running this
              Administration.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From time to time, the Executive will make
              mistakes in the allocation of money, but the point in comparison
              to direct rule is not that mistakes are not made, it is that those
              mistakes will, I hope, be corrected more rapidly than was the case
              before 1999. Today we are considering £5&nbsp;billion expenditure
              in the Northern Ireland block, but whatever happens to the Barnett
              formula it would be unwise to assume or bank on any big jump —
              much though we might like it — in the amount of public money
              provided per capita. That is not at all likely. The imperative is,
              and no doubt always will be, one of a careful stewardship of our
              resources. I support the motion.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for Culture,
              Arts and Leisure (Mr ONeill):</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for his in-depth
              examination of the Supply resolution. We were very glad of his
              grasp of the financial situation, because at times it seemed quite
              expansive to me. The Committee welcomes the additional allocations
              in the Budget this year in respect of libraries, health and safety
              in sports grounds, the languages body and improved access to, and
              participation in, the arts by young people and those who are most
              disadvantaged in the community. As we have pointed out already,
              the Department’s total allocation is modest compared to its
              assessment of its need for this year.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee hopes that the Department will
              fare better in 2002-03. We, like all other Committees, have
              aspirations in that regard, although we have not yet been informed
              of what those needs are.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We were also glad that the Executive programme
              funds provided much-needed resources — totalling £7 million
              over three years — in critical areas, including some that we
              have pushed very strongly for. One example is the £400,000 to be
              spent this year on beginning the process of buying out the
              commercial fishing nets around the Northern Ireland coastline. As
              I have said before in the House, the impact of this measure in
              arresting the decline in the North Atlantic salmon population in
              our rivers will be enormous.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also £300,000 additional expenditure
              to begin work on the vital and imaginative Northern Ireland
              electronic libraries project.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our Committee has expressed its concern to the
              Department that following negotiations nothing was included for
              the safety improvements of existing motorcycle road racing
              facilities. Again, I take the opportunity on behalf of the
              Committee to remind the House and the Minister of Finance about
              this issue, which has been the subject of much debate in the
              Committee, the Department and the community. It is an issue
              requiring urgent attention, and it is one in which small amounts
              of funding could go a very long way.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee is also concerned that the
              current year’s funding for the arts is so low. The Minister
              referred to it as an improvement in expenditure. For a couple of
              months, we have been taking oral evidence in our inquiry into
              cultural tourism and the arts, and it is clear that this area is
              very poorly funded despite the tremendous potential and talent
              that exists in all aspects of the arts in Northern Ireland. I am
              amazed that there are so many enthusiastic and committed people in
              the arts. With a small nudge in the right direction, that
              potential could achieve a tremendous amount for the whole
              community and could help to create sustainability.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The closure of the Navan Centre has very
              seriously concerned the Committee, and it would be remiss of me
              not to mention it. The main reason given was resource problems.
              The Committee has asked for a meeting with the Minister to go
              through the detail of the situation, and I do not want to pre-empt
              that. However, this is as good an opportunity as any to make a
              point on behalf of the Committee. A pre-emptive move such as this
              closure, without a proper examination — at least, as far as we
              are aware there was no proper examination — of the circumstances
              that led to that decision seems to have been very hasty indeed. It
              came towards the end of the foot-and mouth disease crisis, when
              one might have hoped to see an upturn in visitor figures.
              Considering the importance of that facility for Northern Ireland,
              the whole island, and internationally, it is a very abrupt way of
              dealing with a situation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As we all know, once something is closed it can
              be very difficult to get it up and running again. Is there any
              possibility that the Minister of Finance might have an idea of how
              to handle this type of crisis with support until such times as a
              proper publicly accountable examination can be carried out to
              ensure that such decisions are not too hasty?</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.00 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee also shares the view of the
              Chairperson of the Finance and Personnel Committee and other
              Chairpersons that finding adequate time for consultation is
              problematic. I recognise that time laid aside for consultation can
              be freely interfered with by events such as elections. I applaud
              the Minister on his clear attempt to improve on last year’s
              timescale. As we should also continue to look at ways in which we
              could make the timescale even better, I am glad that the Minister
              announced that intention earlier.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In general, the Committee welcomes and supports
              this stage of the Supply resolution.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to focus on the shortfall that will
              affect the road system and the education system in my constituency
              and on its periphery, despite the proposed increase that the
              Minister spoke of.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many of us in the Ards borough and on the Ards
              Peninsula sat by while road improvements took place elsewhere.
              That must be proactively addressed. It is all very well for people
              to say that the Minister for Regional Development can do that. On
              the contrary, he can only do so if he is given the funding.
              Unfortunately, the Minister of Finance and Personnel’s statement
              estimated that the increase for the Department for Regional
              Development should amount to 2·58%. Obviously that is of great
              concern to us, because that 2·58% could be used in the Strangford
              constituency alone.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our roads have continued to deteriorate and are
              now in the worst condition seen for many decades. Last winter saw
              the Ards borough road network in especially bad straits. While
              some improvement work has been done, the number of serious
              potholes in the area has highlighted the need for more attention.
              It is clear to any regular car user that the deterioration of the
              roads is ever-increasing, to the extent that drivers may be unable
              to control their vehicles.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Roads Service has a number of appointees
              whose duty it is to locate and mark parts of the roads which need
              to be repaired. A great deal of the deterioration appears to have
              been missed. The Department seems to be playing catch-up with the
              amount of repairs that are needed to the roads in my area. This
              must be addressed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, the Roads Service was allocated
              only about half the amount needed to maintain the road network.
              Divisional road managers in the service are currently preparing
              proposed road maintenance programmes for 2001–02. They will
              inform councils about that programme at the end of June. The Roads
              Service advised me that the focus will be on the structural
              maintenance of the road network through carriageway resurfacing
              and surface dressing, along with the repair and augmentation of
              the road drainage system.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will there be adequate funding for the Roads
              Service’s proposals? My constituents and I are worried that we
              will again find that the roads in the Ards borough and the
              Strangford constituency fall far behind those in other parts of
              the Province. My Colleague Mr Gibson always tells us that the
              roads in west Tyrone are the worst, but if he comes to the Ards
              Peninsula he will see what bad roads are.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a result of the inability to cope with
              repairs, the Department for Regional Development hears a litany of
              compensation claims. Over the past months, an increasing number of
              my constituents in Strangford have come to the advice centre in
              Frances Street with complaints about the state of the roads, the
              damage caused to vehicles by poor road conditions and the length
              of time they must wait to obtain compensation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some have been waiting for more than six months
              for compensation claims to be properly processed despite the fact
              that the average waiting time is five and a half months. There is
              something seriously wrong if the claims can not be processed on
              time. Changes need to be made as soon as possible to make the
              system more efficient so that the Department can give the public a
              satisfactory level of service.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our roads are disintegrating as a result of
              gross underfunding, and the number of claims for compensation
              reflects the dire nature of the situation. In 1999-00, 1,702
              compensation claims were submitted in the area that I represent.
              In 2000-01, 2,094 claims were submitted which is a rise of almost
              a quarter.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCoubrey of the Roads Service stated that</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Roads are the backbone of Northern
              Ireland’s social and economic life&quot;.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In spite of this, his Department, because of
              its lack of funding, has been unable to grasp the nettle. We are
              desperately seeking to attract business and employment to the
              area, but I am sure that the poor condition of the roads has been
              a major factor in the failure by interested parties to secure
              investment. We need to ask why people who have come to our
              constituency with a view to developing factories or businesses
              there have not stayed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have lobbied the Department on several
              occasions, and I will continue to do so. However, Members, and Mr
              Durkan in particular, must add their voices to the list of
              concerned parties. Perhaps Mr Durkan can release the necessary
              funding. The situation is wholly unacceptable. After ten years of
              lobbying, the main route between Portavogie and Ballyhalbert has
              finally been upgraded. Such delay is unwarranted, and the state of
              disrepair is unparalleled. That message must be made very clear.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The situation is such that the Department’s
              commitment to providing and maintaining a satisfactory road
              network and its compensation procedures must be questioned. We
              must ask why there has been such underfunding of roads that their
              deterioration is increasing the number of compensation claims. The
              Minister for Regional Development has assured me that he will be
              pressing for further funding. However, beyond the 2·58% increase,
              what funding can the Minister allocate to our area?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will highlight areas in my constituency where
              there is insufficient funding for education. The education budget
              has been increased by 9·7%, and this is to be welcomed, but will
              any of that money be spent on the people that I represent? In the
              mid-Down area, which includes part of the area Mr ONeill
              represents, most people, especially those with children who are
              approaching secondary school age, are aware of the difficulty in
              obtaining school places. They are also aware of the public
              pressure for the reopening of Killyleagh High School.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The cases of pupils who were refused admission
              to Saintfield High School have been well documented by the media.
              As a result of the fundamental problem of insufficient places,
              weaknesses have filtered through all aspects of the transfer
              procedure. As a result the criteria used in the area, and
              especially in Saintfield, to allocate places have become
              inefficient and profoundly unfair. In other areas there are no
              such problems, and criteria can be used successfully without
              alienating or offending anyone. In Saintfield, however, the use of
              the same criteria over the past few years has resulted in
              prejudice against some local children.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Four years ago the annual intake to Saintfield
              High School was cut from 90 to just over 60. Given that the aim is
              to address the competition for school places, it would have been
              wiser to increase the percentage of local pupils who attend the
              local high school. Unfortunately, a situation has arisen whereby
              children who have family ties with the school travel from Belfast,
              Comber and Downpatrick, while some children from Saintfield are
              turned away.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Flexibility is needed to deal with the
              problems, and finance must be put in the right pockets to ensure
              that these issues are addressed. To date, the criteria have been
              applied so rigidly that pupils’ education is being put in
              jeopardy. The heart of the problem lies with the closure of
              schools in the area, and until this is addressed a system is
              needed to accommodate local pupils, because they deserve better.
              Without such action the problems can only get worse.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the people of Newtownards and district are
              not to be exposed to the same crisis in secondary education as we
              have witnessed in mid-Down, it is essential that Scrabo High
              School be retained. There is already competition for places at
              Movilla High School and Regent House Grammar School in the area,
              and it is clear that within the next five to ten years the
              problems concerning secondary education places in Newtownards will
              continue to grow. We witnessed the same short-sightedness on the
              part of the board towards Killyleagh High School, when education
              standards were not maintained so that a few pennies could be
              saved.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The situation in mid-Down has now reached
              crisis point, with so few secondary places available that students
              are forced to travel to either Downpatrick or Comber to receive
              their education. At least we still have the option of reopening
              Killyleagh High School. To continue with the sale of Scrabo High
              School is utter lunacy. It may save a few pounds in the short
              term, but it will cause pain and anxiety for many local parents in
              the not-too-distant future.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the same vein, special schools throughout
              Northern Ireland require increased funding if they are to meet
              their current demands. There are real shortfalls in special needs
              education for children in the Ards area. A wee bit more funding
              for Killard House Special School would be sufficient to bring in
              another class and ensure that the special educational needs of the
              children in the area are addressed. That can only happen if the
              funding is there. That 9·7% of the education budget must go where
              the need is. There is a need for secondary education in the Ards
              Borough Council area. There is a need in Strangford, and we should
              examine that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The plight of the non-maintained sector has
              been directly precipitated by the openly prejudiced behaviour of
              the Minister in command of the Education Department in ignoring
              the needs and the requirements of the state sector, preferring
              instead to give priority to the maintained and integrated sectors.
              I fear that the crisis in education will continue until he is
              removed from office.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is very important that we are discussing and
              approving this Supply resolution today, because only a few years
              ago this scene would have been unimaginable. We are working
              together across all parties — and I stress all parties — on
              issues that unite rather than divide us.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We know that the resources we get from the
              Treasury are not sufficient to meet the needs of our society, and
              so does the wider public. We also know that the rates are one of
              the few sources of funds for health, education, roads and the
              other services so badly needed by our people. We all hate the
              rates but we should realise how much we actually need them,
              because this is real politics. What can we do when our only way of
              raising revenue is through the rates? We can pretend, score
              political points and ignore the reality, or we can accept that
              however unpalatable it may be, we need them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also need to develop other areas of funding
              and efficiency so that we can reduce our dependence on the rates.
              It is important that we approve the Supply resolution, but it is
              also immensely important that we support and approve the action of
              our Finance Minister. He does a difficult and complex job fairly
              and professionally. Even his sternest critics would commend his
              professionalism on these issues.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, it is insufficient to merely
              congratulate from these Benches. All of us in this Assembly, in
              the Committees and in the Executive must work ceaselessly in
              pursuit of the goals of the community. We need to increase the
              resources available for allocation to meet the needs of our
              people. Therefore we should be watchful of expenditures that do
              not meet the priorities that we know exist. We must continually
              question the use of resources in every Department and ask whether
              such usage represents value for money. We must strive to find
              innovative ways of funding our services, not just through the
              private finance initiative or public-private partnership, but also
              through using not-for-profit organisations to deliver services in
              a way that ensures professionalism and, at the same time, derives
              other benefits in terms of secondary goals.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must ensure that our public procurement is
              used in ways that not only satisfy a need but also, where
              possible, liberate opportunity for the people and the economy.
              There are many ways in which we can wage war on need, utilising
              resources more efficiently and effectively, and thereby maximising
              the return to our people. We need to explore these, no matter how
              small. We can be rightly proud and happy with this Budget and the
              increases achieved, but we cannot be complacent or rest on this
              success. We must build and innovate, develop and continuously
              improve our activities. We need to get behind Mark Durkan, the
              Minister of Finance and Personnel, and support and encourage his
              efforts as he leads this Administration’s effort to secure more
              resources, both from the Treasury and through actions internal to
              Government.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the Supply resolution and ask this
              House to do the same. To build the resource base for the future
              society needs this approach, and the people demand it.</p>

              Minister and the House that I will be extremely brief.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have to agree with much of what Patricia
              Lewsley had to say. We cannot ignore reality. I doubt there is
              anybody in this House who does not enjoy the opportunity that the
              Assembly has afforded us to look at and control our own Budget. It
              is a great pity that we all know we are facing a threat to the
              continuation of this. I appeal to those who pose that main threat
              to this institution to do what is expected of them in the
              agreement — to start the process of decommissioning of weapons
              and allow us to continue here with proper government for Northern
              Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to say to Mr Shannon that I am in
              total agreement with his Colleague Mr Gibson. In the west Tyrone
              area we do have the worst roads in Northern Ireland.</p>

              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hussey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am talking about previous addresses to the
              Assembly. We are totally together, and I believe we were called
              &quot;Team West Tyrone&quot; earlier in the Chamber.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a threat to the roads network
              throughout Northern Ireland. A danger may exist in the future
              strategy of concentrating on the main transportation corridors,
              and the rural network could suffer through that. Like Mr Shannon,
              I appeal for the Minister of Finance and Personnel to ensure that
              the regional development budget is sufficient to ensure that the
              total transport infrastructure is dealt with in a proper way. It
              should not be allowed to constantly go down, down and down to the
              point of becoming unreasonable.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am seeking clarification from the Minister on
              the subject of European funds, which he mentioned with regard to
              one or two Departments. Indeed, in respect of his own Department
              he mentioned a sum of money that struck me as being laid aside as
              pump-priming. What additional funding does the Minister expect to
              come through that he will have to deal with? Also, can he assure
              Members and clarify to the House that the Assembly would be
              dealing with additional funding available to it from Europe, as
              opposed to the previous situation?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I said I would be brief, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>

              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hay:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What the Minister of Finance and Personnel has
              announced today is fine detail. That is important and good for us
              all. Usually when the Minister announces a Budget, we get a run
              around west Tyrone roads.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One point concerns the maintenance of roads.
              There is no doubt that if we cannot maintain existing roads, we
              will find it more and more difficult to raise capital money for
              new schemes. The Department for Regional Development sees roads
              maintenance as a priority, because defects are increasing every
              year, and there is no money to repair them. How are we going to
              address that problem?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department has asked for additional funding
              of about £40 million to address this. We also have to raise the
              matter of the Roads Service’s capital budget with the Minister,
              because that concerns us deeply, not only in the west of the
              Province, but across Northern Ireland. That capital budget causes
              great concern. Officials tell those of us who managed to get
              re-elected to councils what they have to spend in our areas,
              whether for maintenance, capital schemes or whatever. Meetings
              between officials and councillors in all the 26 district councils
              are usually fairly lively.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Councillors ask whether the situation has
              improved since the setting up of the Assembly, and the public
              assumes that, because we now have an Assembly here, we have more
              money to spend and it should not be a problem for Mr Durkan to get
              a few million pounds if he needs them. Members of the public do
              not understand why we do not have extra money. To get the
              necessary money to deal with priorities is as difficult for the
              Minister of Finance as it is for any Minister. Irrespective of how
              the Minister of Finance announces extra money, he is criticised,
              because some of us will say that it is still not enough, and no
              matter how much money we get from the block grant, it will never
              be enough to address some of the serious issues that concern us,
              whether they be health, education, or the Department for Regional
              Development.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will never have enough money to address the
              needs that must be looked at. We must look at other ways of
              raising money. That is where the difficulty arises. However, there
              are other models and methods that have to be considered.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of us who sit on the Regional Development
              Committee know the serious situation that the Water Service is in.
              Some of the issues that it has raised with Committee members would
              make your hair stand on end. We have heard about our sewerage
              system and water treatment system, and we are trying to find out
              exactly how to move things forward. We were simply told that there
              must be massive investment in those two areas in the Department
              for Regional Development. It could take five years, 10 years, or
              even longer, to reach the point where we have a modern system —
              whether it is a roads system or a water system.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">EU regulations are driving forward the issue of
              the water system. We are having to try to keep abreast of
              regulations that change year after year, and it is costing the
              Department a huge amount of money to do that. I want to know how
              the Minister plans to raise the extra money needed if we are going
              to resolve some of the Northern Ireland’s serious problems.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All Departments need money — each needs a
              large amount of money to address the serious issues that are
              concerning us in Northern Ireland. As I said earlier, each time
              the Minister announces the Budget, or extra resources, it is only
              a small drop into what is really needed by every Department. The
              public perceives that the Assembly can address some of these
              problems very quickly. We know that some of the issues could take
              many years to address across every Department.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that we try to come up with new
              ideas on how we can raise the necessary finances to address our
              problems. The public will not wait five or 10 years for the
              problems in health and hospital waiting lists to be dealt with.
              They will not wait much longer for problems in the transportation
              network to be addressed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I heard Mr Hussey talking about transportation
              networks. There is no network in west Tyrone or throughout the
              west of the Province — an area starved of resources for many
              years. We could spend all day debating why that happened, but, as
              someone from the west, and who has represented the west of the
              Province for 20 years, I can say that the resources have not been
              there. They have not been there for a long time. The west of the
              Province comes from a lower base — it always has done.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When I see the road networks in other parts of
              the Province and come back to the west I ask myself &quot;Where
              did it go wrong?&quot; The problem has existed for about 30 years.
              I have no doubt about that. I remember when Roads Service
              officials came to council. There were occasions when we did not
              meet them at all. We did not even allow them to open the book,
              because we were so fed up with them continually telling us that
              there was no money for any capital schemes and that there would be
              no money for the next five to 10 years. I remember that we closed
              one council meeting after five minutes because there was no point
              in listening to them — they had nothing new to tell us since the
              previous year.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is how bad it was. Things are slightly
              better now, because they understand the concerns of the west of
              the Province, but we could be debating the same issue in two or
              three years’ time and still have no real resources to show for

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Bradley:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate the Minister on the presentation
              of the Estimates, and I welcome the increase in the funding for
              the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. However,
              there would be something wrong if, as elected representatives, we
              did not seek a little more.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What percentage of the estimated
              £223&nbsp;million will make its way directly to the farming
              community? I hope that that is not an unreasonable question. I
              would also like to say, following on from what the Chairperson of
              the Agriculture Committee said, that it is my party’s view that
              an early retirement scheme would be beneficial to the industry.
              Such a scheme, combined with a newcomer scheme, would have been
              welcome, but we may, regrettably, have to wait for at least
              another year. I hope that the Minister will take note for next
              year and put that near the top of his agenda. The Minister has
              earmarked £8·6&nbsp;million for rural development. That amount
              will not create the desired vibrancy in rural areas. Therefore it
              is important that as much of that sum as possible reaches the
              people.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I acknowledge the efforts made by the Minister
              to help the agriculture industry, and I congratulate him on the
              Estimates. No doubt, he has burned the midnight oil in preparing
              the paper. Will he give an assurance that the spending of the
              £223&nbsp;million will be closely monitored to ensure that every
              available penny reaches the farming community?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gibson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I come at the Budget speech today from a
              somewhat different angle. I was hopeful about the Budget; it is
              our first real attempt to assess our needs.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to put the case for the west of the
              Province. We have suffered a serious battering from bomb and
              bullet that has torn our social infrastructure apart. The Orange
              halls that were once community centres for the rural Protestant
              population have been neglected because of intimidation and other
              forms of discrimination. The halls are in a state ranging from
              good to very basic, but they are still part of the social
              infrastructure. If that community is to re-emerge as an active
              part of the west Tyrone community, it must be helped to develop
              and renew its social infrastructure.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Removing the rates from Orange halls would
              involve little effort, but it would help. Parochial halls, church
              halls and community halls are not rated, but they serve the same
              purposes as small rural Orange halls. The Orange halls are social
              centres for the local Protestant community but must pay rates. The
              cost of one cross-border conference would cover it. The Minister
              should consider that only a minor change to the legislation would
              be needed and that only a small amount of money would be lost by
              removing the rates. That would be a start to rebuilding the
              Protestant community’s infrastructure and would encourage those
              people to recommence active social life.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also suggest that in the whole budgetary
              allowance, greater consideration should be given to victims. I am
              not talking just about the Omagh bomb. I am talking about the 97
              people who were murdered in my constituency before the Omagh bomb.
              These are the people who, over 30 years, have suffered deep-seated
              physical, psychological and mental disabilities. Homes have been
              decimated. I would have thought that we would have shown
              reconciliation in this Budget by demonstrating that there was
              going to be a willingness and a helpfulness to the community that
              has suffered so much.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am appealing today to the Minister to take on
              board those very human aspects of healing and reconciling those in
              the west of the Province who have suffered because of their
              remoteness and their religious affiliation. Their social
              infrastructure has to be activated and redeveloped to bring it up
              to modern needs and requirements.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with William Hay that it did not matter
              how much the Minister announced. I thoroughly congratulate the
              Minister on presenting this Budget, with the increases therein.
              But let me take you to seven of my constituents who are waiting
              for heart bypasses — those operations that cast gloom over a
              family. Take a farmer who has been told some weeks ago that his
              condition is such that they will not allow him out of hospital.
              Priorities come into play. Finance comes into play. The man is
              sent home, and he is still at home, waiting for a call. It is to
              be hoped that he will get someone who has either dropped out of
              the queue, or who has died while still on the waiting list.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is the reality of our provision at this
              time. I can think of seven others in my constituency about whom I
              have written to the Department of Health, asking that special
              consideration be given to them. They are the breadwinners of their
              families, with the whole family waiting in fear, trembling and
              desperation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Budgetary consent is something that has to be
              examined. Where are our priorities? I think of those who are
              waiting for hip replacements and those who are struggling to get
              money to go into the private sector to be relieved of the serious
              agony of a hip joint replacement. I am told that there is a
              marketplace that ranges from £6,000 in the Royal Victoria
              Hospital to £2,000 in Letterkenny. There is something seriously
              wrong with our system when people are forced, despite having paid
              every required contribution to the Health Service, to go to their
              own private financial resources. This Budget does need
              examination.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will move on to the area of rural proofing,
              which we were assured would take place. This Budget has not
              indicated how we are going to rural proof. How do you rural proof
              to give equality of opportunity to the people of my constituency
              as well as those who live in the more wealthy, opulent Strangford
              area? This Budget has to take consideration of Government policy
              statements. If the Government statements do not measure up — <i>[Interruption]</i>.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The roads issue has already been very well
              dealt with, but I want to make another plea, because the Minister
              and the finance people have been good — <i>[Interruption]</i>.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must insist that this does not happen again.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gibson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also insist that it be switched off, because
              I am speaking.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have £20 million for the A5, but we have
              the worse problem of getting to the A5 on class B roads. Our roads
              are outworn. I am sure that the Minister is fed up hearing this
              from west Tyrone and the west of the Province, but the roads are
              rugged and outworn.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yesterday evening I went to look at Oldcastle
              Road outside Newtownstewart. The last time I was on it, it was
              like a road into a quarry. The best they could do was darn the
              road, but the road has often been darned. I could take Members
              through Omagh and along the Hospital Road and the Derry Road, two
              arterial routes through the largest town in the west of the
              Province — but they are like test tracks for a Sherman tank. The
              surface has been rutted, relaid and re-piped — everything has
              been done to it. Driving on it now is like spending an hour on the
              bumper cars at Bundoran.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Serious consideration needs to be given to us.
              We do not have railways or airports; we have only one
              infrastructure —a roads system, and it is a terrible one. The
              question has been asked &quot;Is it worn beyond repair?&quot;. It
              is now becoming an argument about value for money. A little repair
              over many years would have prevented the massive capital input
              that is now needed to bring the roads up to standard. Even if the
              Minister were to pour in millions of pounds per year, the
              contractors would probably be working and charging double the
              price because they could not keep up with the amount of work that
              needs to be done.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have a desperate problem and, as my
              Colleague William Hay has suggested, alternative forms of
              financing our infrastructure must be sought and found, because we
              cannot go on living in a state of desperation. There is supposed
              to be a normal standard, but our roads are abnormal.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally — and I know that our time is nearly
              up — I want to deal with education and rural proofing. Rural
              schools are still a central part of our community, and there is
              always a push for rationalisation and great concern about viable
              numbers. However, other countries like Belgium and Holland have
              proved that you do not need to have such equations of numbers.
              They deliver a very good education system — in fact, one that is
              suspected to be better than ours at primary level — yet they can
              retain a rural school infrastructure. By clustering the resources
              and combining a number of other qualities of the provision of
              teaching staff, rural schools can be retained. However, no
              research has been done on that, and there is no indication in the
              Estimates that any research money is going to be put into that
              area.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Assembly is serious about the Budget
              proposals, there are areas of concern that need to be given
              priority. I appeal to the Minister to prioritise in order to solve
              some of the desperate rural problems.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will endeavour to respond to the debate, and
              I hope that I will not need much time tomorrow. When I opened the
              debate I was looking forward to a responsible discussion of the
              Supply resolution, and that has been achieved. The contributions
              have ranged widely, although not as widely as some previous
              contributions have, and Members’ points have been made clearly
              and forcefully. I have noted each of the points, and if I am not
              able to address them all, I will follow them up and reflect
              further.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion before the House is the basis upon
              which the legislature, in the form of the Assembly, authorises the
              spending of Departments, the Assembly, the Northern Ireland Audit
              Office and other bodies to enable them to carry out their
              functions. That is one of the Assembly’s most fundamental
              responsibilities. It involves the authorisation of expenditure
              and, importantly, it holds Departments to account as they seek to
              deliver on their Programme for Government priorities. I accept
              that time is limited, so if I leave out some significant
              challenges that have been made to me, it will have been
              conveniently so.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Molloy, Chairperson of the Committee for
              Finance and Personnel, raised some questions about the Budget
              consultation — and I appreciate that Mr Molloy had to leave the
              House to attend a council annual general meeting at 7.00 pm. The
              Executive are committed to providing Committees with a
              constructive role in the development of the Budget for 2002-03.
              That is reflected in the proposals that have been set out for the
              Budget timetable, which I presented in a previous statement.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department has tried to deliver on the main
              aim as set out by the Committee for Finance and Personnel last
              year. It had concerns about the time available to consider the
              Budget, and we were keen to ensure that we would be able to take
              the Budget as soon as possible after the summer recess. To
              facilitate that, the Department of Finance and Personnel has today
              made the position reports available to the Committee Chairpersons,
              through the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister. Those
              reports will not only inform the Chairpersons of the Executive’s
              consideration of the work in relation to the Programme for
              Government but also of the work relating to the draft Budget.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I assure the House, and particularly the
              Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel, that those
              position reports were only made available to Ministers in the
              middle of last week. Therefore, there has been no question of
              trying to pre-cook things separately through the Executive in ways
              that deny Committees anything.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The position reports that were made available
              to Committees today reflect the same information that went to the
              Ministers last week — bids for next year, for instance.
              Therefore information is not being withheld from Members in the
              way that has been suggested. Members will be able to discuss
              further issues relating to the future process when I make a
              pre-Budget statement tomorrow, after which they will be free to
              ask questions about next year’s Budget, and also as the
              Department takes forward the work with the Committee for Finance
              and Personnel.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many of the points raised have involved people
              seeking increases in various budget lines and emphasising the
              needs of particular sectors or particular localities. Many of
              those issues will be more pertinent to the consideration of next
              year’s Budget, and the possible adjustments to the Programme for
              Government, than to the Supply resolution or the Budget Bill per
              se.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remind Members that we are dealing with the
              second instalment — the major and final instalment — of the
              Budget for this year. The figures that are being referred to
              today, and the Estimates that were laid in the Assembly on 11
              June, are figures that derive from the Budget. I have explained
              why some of the figures are not in exact accord with the Budget
              because of the nature of the Estimates in changing over to
              resource accounting and budgeting. Dr Paisley reflected on that in
              a point that arose in exchanges between his Committee and the
              Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members have raised a number of questions. Mr
              Shannon, Mr Hay, Mr Hussey and Mr Gibson all raised issues about
              the roads budget. Some of the questions were about roads in
              particular localities, such as the Ards Peninsula, west Tyrone and
              the western area in general. I want to emphasise that the Budget
              that we adopted did commit new resources to roads. It also
              committed new resources to other significant areas of the
              Department for Regional Development’s programme.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are conscious of the historic underfunding
              that there has been in relation to infrastructure. The moneys that
              we made available in the Budget were further supplemented by
              allocations from the Executive programme funds and infrastructure
              fund.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In some areas, people are pressing for further
              attention to be given to maintenance and capital investment in
              roads. Those will be relevant issues for people to pursue and take
              up in the context of the preparatory work for next year’s Budget
              and the Programme for Government. If Members have particular
              concerns about the relative priorities within the existing roads
              budget, those can be taken up with the Minister and the Department
              for Regional Development, as prioritisation within the budget
              falls to that Department.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to make a similar point in
              relation to some of the questions that were raised about
              education. Members have emphasised the importance of ensuring
              adequate resources for schools. The Executive, the Minister of
              Education and I have made it clear that we want to make sure that
              we improve our school stock and the performance of our schools. We
              want to do that with proper investment, both in the education
              programme and in the schools capital programme. We have shown that
              in the previous Budget, again supplemented by the allocations from
              the Executive programme funds.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I stress to Members that I have noted the
              insinuation that there is some discrimination being practised
              either by the Executive or by the Minister of Education in
              relation to the schools’ budget. I reject any such insinuation.
              If Members believe that any measure being pursued on behalf of
              this Assembly by any Department raises issues in relation to
              equality considerations, there are procedures that can be invoked
              on that. No one has ever invoked any of those procedures. People
              have traded on all sorts of insinuations. I stated in the House
              previously, when this question arose in the context of the
              Executive programme funds, that allocations are made on the basis
              of educational need.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The readiness of projects can also be relevant
              when it comes to spending money. It would not make sense to
              allocate money to projects not ready to make use of it. The
              information shows that the allocations are being made fairly and
              properly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The question was asked as to what proportion of
              the agriculture spend will go to farmers. A significant proportion
              of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development’s
              Estimate will benefit farmers directly. In &quot;Resources,
              Grants&quot;, £170 million is for subsidy payments direct to
              farmers under the common agriculture policy. Additionally, there
              is an allocation of £14 million for agrienvironment schemes. In
              &quot;Resources, Other Current&quot;, there is an allocation of
              £12 million for animal disease compensation. A substantial
              proportion of the &quot;Resources, Administration&quot; total of
              £117 million reflects the cost of departmental staff carrying out
              essential work for the operation of the industry. This includes
              statutory and regulatory inspections and testing, the reduction of
              animal disease levels, ensuring access to EU funds and
              high-quality education and advice.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie raised a number of concerns within
              the context of a broad welcome for our ability to conduct our
              Budget business in this way. I reassure Dr Birnie that the
              Executive do appreciate the significance that many Members —
              particularly the members of his Committee — attach to improving
              our performance in relation to basic adult skills, especially
              numeracy and literacy. We have been able to make some moves in
              that direction, not least in the context of the Executive
              programme funds. As regards further improvements, I refer Dr&nbsp;Birnie
              to the preparatory work in the context of next year’s Budget and
              Programme for Government.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Lewsley stressed the need for us to look at
              efficiency, not just at the money that is becoming available for
              the Budget. Committees in particular — and the Assembly in
              general — need to make sure that we are not just watching the
              bids but overseeing the spending in a sound and proper way. Ms
              Lewsley referred to the fact that we have to try to find
              additional means to supplement our expenditure and ways of
              improving delivery in order to release other resources. The same
              point was made by Mr Hay when he emphasised the need to add to the
              scope that we have for improving the levels of money available for
              public services and for important capital programmes. Mr&nbsp;Hay
              and Mr&nbsp;Gibson welcomed the increases available in this
              Budget. I also welcome those increases, and that is why I have
              always voted for this Budget. However, some people who have
              welcomed the increases that are reflected in today’s motion have
              not always voted for the Budget the whole way down the line.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When looking at areas of additional resources
              there is no simple solution. We cannot take an &quot;over the
              rainbow&quot; approach to the question of the Barnett formula. Dr
              Birnie’s cautious words were correct in that we face difficult
              issues in relation to the Barnett formula. We do have some hard
              questions to put to the Treasury, but hard questions will also be
              put to us, and not just by the Treasury but by a range of other
              regional and national interests.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must not believe that there is a magic
              bullet out there as far as the Barnett formula or finding
              additional moneys are concerned. Some of the ideas being suggested
              as magic bullets, such as the setting up of some type of bond,
              would not be easy to implement, because Treasury rules would count
              those as spending, and they would be scored against the
              departmental expenditure limits. It would not give us any
              additional public spending.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The time has beaten me. I hope that I have
              responded to most of the issues raised by Members. Any individual
              points not addressed in my general response will be followed up
              directly or will be brought to the attention of the Minister
              concerned.</p>
